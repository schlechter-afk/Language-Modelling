Chapter I	264.9481201171875
The Shade of Cardinal Richelieu	325.3875732421875
In a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal formerly styled the Palais Cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers	149.8191680908203
Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with waxlights	79.45238494873047
Any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt	71.64154815673828
It was alas the ghost of former greatness	7.223726272583008
France enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence	473.23321533203125
In truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais Royal that the people were possessed of arms	222.105712890625
The shade of Richelieu was Mazarin	90.49346160888672
Now Mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew	271.11016845703125
Foreigner he ejaculated Italian that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproachthe watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with Concini and if I gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then	175.11341857910156
Idiots ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the Italian who speaks French badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest Parisian accent who are their real foes	103.06607055664062
Yes yes Mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know I am no ordinary favorite	449.9277648925781
No The Earl of Essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst II have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the Palais Royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout Down with Mazarin I unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out Long live the Duke de Beaufort one day another Long live the Prince de Conde and again Long live the parliament And at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	150.30487060546875
The parliament We shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament Both Orleans and Montargis are ours	238.9790802001953
It will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out Down with Mazarin will finish by shouting out Down with all the people I have mentioned each in his turn	281.5092468261719
It is said that Mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to Anne of Austria	190.20205688476562
La Portes Memoirs	119.44693756103516
Richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than I am	123.31072235107422
Often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	99.18268585205078
The queen will never banish me and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if I fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	107.62317657470703
Oh were I not a foreigner were I but a Frenchman were I but of gentle birth	78.69912719726562
The position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties	80.00813293457031
Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in France	67.64835357666016
Crushed and impoverished by taxationimposed by Mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dustthe people as the AdvocateGeneral Talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur	308.1148376464844
Patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent	92.48722076416016
Had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of France separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	98.02880096435547
Now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties	97.68508911132812
On the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property	22.982059478759766
They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of Orleans who according to his custom affected popularity	90.59635162353516
The duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms	135.55844116210938
They were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty We will see what we can do	81.41980743408203
Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of Orleansthat he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned	92.57131958007812
This man named Emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred	36.713836669921875
He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to Emery and Cardinal Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII	83.03742980957031
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	201.33502197265625
You surprise me exclaimed the monarch	187.09124755859375
I am rejoiced to hear you speak of Monsieur dEmery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	275.23956298828125
I was really afraid that you were going to force that villain Particelli upon me	155.75347900390625
Sire replied Richelieu rest assured that Particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged	135.7992401123047
Ah so much the better exclaimed the king	302.2854919433594
It is not for nothing that I am styled Louis the Just and he signed Emerys appointment	130.78256225585938
This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance	97.74552154541016
He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	71.05376434326172
The mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe	86.51292419433594
This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself	111.63379669189453
The fact was that Emerys son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed	298.1269226074219
Nothing therefore was settled that day as Emerys head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence	76.14117431640625
On the next day Mathieu Mol the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the Cardinal de Retz was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de Condin other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in Francehad been attacked in his turn	229.58177185058594
The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	63.178504943847656
But the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them	514.7164306640625
To which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	142.38833618164062
Nor was this all	42.15175247192383
On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre Dame as she always did on Saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	90.91352081298828
These poor creatures had no bad intentions	49.92774200439453
They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties	114.25774383544922
At length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained	435.1670227050781
One dayit was the morning of the day my story beginsthe king Louis XIV	83.60952758789062
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the smallpox to Notre Dame	59.21835708618164
He took the opportunity of calling out his guard the Swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the Palais Royal on the quays and on the Pont Neuf	850.7303466796875
After mass the young monarch drove to the Parliament House where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to Cardinal de Retz more ruinous than the othersa proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president Molwhilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes	70.16574096679688
The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais Royal	182.60275268554688
All minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language	54.98809814453125
At first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of Down with Mazarin Long live Broussel Long live Blancmesnil resounded through the city	444.9092712402344
For the people had learned that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the peoples goodwill	336.8140563964844
All attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	327.085693359375
Orders had just been given to the royal guards and the Swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of Paris was announced at the Palais Royal	51.88652038574219
He was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours Paris would be under arms	39.56085968017578
Deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named Comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood	126.68441772460938
The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	48.242759704589844
As the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob	152.92422485351562
The tocsin was sounded	105.2437515258789
Comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du Trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house	213.95651245117188
They broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain	9891.087890625
Comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story	18442.525390625
This account confirmed that of the mayor	140.62059020996094
The authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt	5.420280933380127
Mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the Pont Neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	100.80877685546875
In fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the Palais Royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	6.245054244995117
Such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarinonce that of Cardinal Richelieu	50.79691696166992
We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room	42.289306640625
All at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice	164.34231567382812
A door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat	61.07630157470703
Bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valetdechambre who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace	36.0285530090332
The Black Musketeers my lord	51.41712188720703
What company	55.341609954833984
Trvilles company	413.2635803222656
Is there any officer belonging to this company in the antechamber	103.48494720458984
Lieutenant dArtagnan	11.809209823608398
A man on whom we can depend I hope	12.834379196166992
Yes my lord	60.97739028930664
Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on	89.33863067626953
The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded	58.56224822998047
The cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in Italy	555.7352294921875
When he was completely dressed he said	320.5910949707031
Send hither Monsieur dArtagnan	96.24567413330078
The valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition	30.115156173706055
When he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction	53.21611022949219
Still youngfor he was scarcely fortysix years of agehe possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height his complexion was brilliant and beautiful his glance full of expression his nose though large was well proportioned his forehead broad and majestic his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it	387.21649169921875
After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only	34.107723236083984
At this instant the door opened	16.093215942382812
Monsieur dArtagnan said the valetdechambre	93.2183837890625
An officer as he spoke entered the apartment	48.41830825805664
He was a man between thirtynine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion	57.38249969482422
DArtagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	149.02430725097656
How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room Seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal	120.3906021118164
The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles	30.28036117553711
The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said	165.57443237304688
You are Monsieur dArtagnan	54.65488052368164
I am that individual replied the officer	171.23719787597656
Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and DArtagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	127.00069427490234
Sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather I am to go with you	128.95484924316406
I am at your command my lord returned DArtagnan	105.13551330566406
I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing	86.69127655029297
Danger my lord exclaimed DArtagnan with a look of astonishment what danger	267.3087158203125
I am told that there is a general insurrection	151.11485290527344
The uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns	176.06431579589844
Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges	98.9321060180664
Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers	6.245054244995117
Which means I suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards	27.971466064453125
The cardinal smiled as he spoke	67.00812530517578
Every one likes his own uniform best my lord	165.5272979736328
Myself excepted and again Mazarin smiled for you perceive that I have left off mine and put on yours	49.210262298583984
Lord bless us this is modesty indeed cried DArtagnan	23.980010986328125
Had I such a uniform as your eminence possesses I protest I should be mightily content and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume	757.6953735351562
Yes but for tonights adventure I do nt suppose my dress would have been a very safe one	111.67431640625
Give me my felt hat Bernouin	2.000459671020508
The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	84.87812805175781
The cardinal put it on in military style	54.29799270629883
Your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to DArtagnan	202.35108947753906
Yes my lord	121.15399932861328
Well let us set out	49.75694274902344
How many men does your eminence wish to escort you	64.01715850830078
You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight	121.69766998291016
As many as my lord wishes	64.59823608398438
I will follow you	138.00994873046875
This waylight us downstairs Bernouin	274.89581298828125
The valet held a waxlight the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the Palais Royal	334.67626953125
Chapter II	221.8551788330078
A Nightly Patrol	61.525840759277344
In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street Les Bons Enfants behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the play of Mirame and in which Mazarin who was an amateur of music but not of literature had introduced into France the first opera that was ever acted in that country	15.709832191467285
The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation	130.0958251953125
Numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever DArtagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect	65.54371643066406
From time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets	47.15361785888672
The report of firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace	42.92560958862305
DArtagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression	132.2598419189453
When he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol	54.8327522277832
The cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage	51.94351577758789
On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens the sentinel cried out Who s there and DArtagnan answeredhaving first asked the word of the cardinalLouis and Rocroy	59.45582962036133
After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost	35.5311393737793
The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat	146.75755310058594
Here was the officer DArtagnan was seeking	25.176124572753906
Here is Monsieur Comminges said DArtagnan returning to the cardinal	114.49317932128906
He instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both Comminges and the other officers on horseback	107.33976745605469
Well done Guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian I see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous	48.25992202758789
What were you saying to this youngster	447.9610595703125
My lord replied Guitant I was observing that we live in troublous times and that todays events are very like those in the days of the Ligue of which I heard so much in my youth	34.7663688659668
Are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and the Rue Saint Antoine	170.1129608154297
And what was Comminges saying to you in reply my good Guitant	32.16797637939453
My lord said Comminges I answered that to compose a Ligue only one ingredient was wantingin my opinion an essential onea Duc de Guise moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice	263.6045227050781
No but they mean to make a Fronde as they call it said Guitant	34.66703414916992
And what is a Fronde inquired Mazarin	33.039207458496094
My lord Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party	822.534912109375
And what is the origin of this name	175.78822326660156
It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slingingqui frondentstones from the moats round Paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned	110.85350799560547
So they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called Frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la Fronde bread a la Fronde hats a la Fronde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fans but listen	96.6565170288086
At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing	75.40507507324219
A tempest from the Fronde Did blow today I think twill blow Sieur Mazarin away	162.83706665039062
Insolent wretch cried Guitant	78.91700744628906
My lord said Comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall I fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future	142.74610900878906
And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow	56.856510162353516
Certainly not certainly not exclaimed Mazarin	55.53129959106445
Diavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil everythingeverything is going on famously	138.58056640625
I know the French as well as if I had made them myself	181.9359588623047
They singlet them pay the piper	167.97938537597656
During the Ligue about which Guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction	93.8291244506836
Come Guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the QuinzeVingts as at the Barriere des Sergens	207.72488403320312
And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined DArtagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal Guitant and the rest of the escort	57.702178955078125
Just so muttered Comminges looking after Mazarin	79.01871490478516
True I forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants	63.751766204833984
The street of Saint Honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day	98.2358169555664
They pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on Mazarin	37.28403854370117
Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to Cond were suggested	97.39816284179688
Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest favor	38.543243408203125
DArtagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	68.77650451660156
Mazarin and Guitant conversed together in whispers	14.86800479888916
The musketeers who had already discovered who Mazarin was followed in profound silence	15.548429489135742
In the street of Saint ThomasduLouvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of QuinzeVingts	54.12517547607422
Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing	160.0624237060547
Ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereaboutif I did not know that something is going on in yonder house	156.74761962890625
And he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the Vaudeville now stands	92.18245697021484
In that hotel it is the Hotel Rambouillet cried Guitant	69.85144805908203
I really do nt know what hotel it is all I do know is that I observed some suspicious looking people go in there	52.96326446533203
Nonsense exclaimed Guitant with a burst of laughter those men must be poets	58.12544250488281
Come Guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said Mazarin do nt you know that I was in my youth a poet I wrote verses in the style of Benserade	50.732666015625
You my lord	49.4705696105957
Yes I shall I repeat to you some of my verses	80.18366241455078
Just as you please my lord	6.8406243324279785
I do not understand Italian	112.42274475097656
Yes but you understand French and Mazarin laid his hand upon Guitants shoulder	305.01568603515625
My good my brave Guitant whatsoever command I may give you in that languagein Frenchwhatever I may order you to do will you not perform it	28.009077072143555
I have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself	32.421905517578125
Yes ah yes Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke I know your devotion to her majesty	270.08642578125
I have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	96.8255386352539
En route Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction	63.998661041259766
DArtagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier	86.53470611572266
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche	68.22992706298828
The Rue Richelieu and the Rue Villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout	181.38392639160156
Who is in command here asked the cardinal	168.36782836914062
Villequier said Guitant	181.6842803955078
Diavolo Speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the Duc de Beaufort this officer and I have been on bad terms	201.0844268798828
He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards	13.062446594238281
I am aware of that and I have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	85.00336456298828
The king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old	66.35149383544922
Yes but I could give him the orderI Guitantand I preferred to give it to you	247.5781707763672
Guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call Monsieur de Villequier	56.61626434326172
Ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here	26.63045883178711
I wish to knowcan you tell me prayis anything fresh occurring in this part of the town	114.70033264160156
What do you mean People cry out Long live the king down with Mazarin That s nothing new no we ve been used to those acclamations for some time	141.96116638183594
And you sing chorus replied Guitant laughing	86.29505157470703
Faith I ve half a mind to do it	50.260108947753906
In my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would I give up five years of my paywhich I am never paid by the wayto make the king five years older	120.5517349243164
Really And pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is	42.213172912597656
As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV	102.28497314453125
than the son of Peter Mazarin	98.03567504882812
Sdeath I would die willingly for the king but supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin as your nephew came near being today there could be nothing in Paradise however well placed I might be there that could console me for it	80.48863220214844
Well well Monsieur de Villequier Mazarin interposed I shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty	50.64240264892578
Come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return	47.86893844604492
Stop exclaimed Villequier so Mazarin was here so much the better	712.3301391601562
I have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him	44.96864318847656
I am obliged to you Guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity	60.45856475830078
He turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the Fronde whilst Mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the Palais Royal	150.9535369873047
All that he had heard from these three different men Comminges Guitant and Villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then Anne of Austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious	41.350059509277344
During the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges Guitant and Villequier Mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	96.39232635498047
This man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at Mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	58.943878173828125
The name of DArtagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin who although he did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative   fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	5807.22802734375
The Three Musketeers	102.30731201171875
Possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about DArtagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from DArtagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a Gascon accent	81.6072769165039
Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais Royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking DArtagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal he made a sign to Guitant to follow him	79.17481994628906
They both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	40.00262451171875
My dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friends arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queens service	147.901611328125
Yes its true	154.87196350097656
I have returned Guitant	520.9036865234375
Now my dear Guitant I have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory	77.54830932617188
You have found that out have you my lord Deuce take itall the worse for me	158.30517578125
There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget	9.631996154785156
But you Guitant are not a courtier	92.10354614257812
You are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV	84.40338134765625
Alas how few today exist	102.05931091308594
Plague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me	97.09517669677734
No I only brought you here to ask you returned Mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers	31.462310791015625
Monsieur dArtagnan I have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old acquaintance	82.58207702636719
He s a Gascon	203.2903594970703
De Trville knows him and esteems him very highly and De Trville as you know is one of the queens greatest friends	60.72648620605469
As a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of Rochelleas at Suze and Perpignan	57.671512603759766
But you know Guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent	74.88375854492188
Pray was not Monsieur dArtagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly	424.29840087890625
My lord as to the report you allude toGuitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outI know nothing but what the public knows	129.92440795898438
I never meddle in intrigues and if I occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret	25.878690719604492
Mazarin shook his head	9.130276679992676
Ah he said some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know	9.130276679992676
My lord replied Guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance they get their information on war from warriors on intrigues from intriguers	44.836429595947266
Consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want	26.614381790161133
Eh pardieu said Mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money	89.50837707519531
They will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it	61.3658332824707
Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day	365.24993896484375
By Bacchus rejoined Mazarin impatiently its about an hour since I asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are	126.01554870605469
There is one man for whom I can answer if he will speak out	149.35060119628906
That s my concern I will make him speak	29.58122444152832
Ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they do nt wish to let out	105.96525573730469
Pooh with patience one must succeed	39.52620315551758
Well this man	31.867136001586914
Who is he	33.17926788330078
The Comte de Rochefort	360.9581604003906
The Comte de Rochefort	212.15557861328125
Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I do nt know where he is	50.210262298583984
I know Guitant said Mazarin	174.3885498046875
Well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information	18.519460678100586
You think resumed Mazarin that Rochefort	77.52949523925781
He was Cardinal Richelieus creature my lord	59.0019416809082
I warn you however his services will cost you something	38.49235916137695
The cardinal was lavish to his underlings	2.000459671020508
Yes yes Guitant said Mazarin Richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect	20.431745529174805
Thanks Guitant I shall benefit by your advice this very evening	119.79916381835938
Here they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the Palais Royal Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure	44.81928634643555
It was DArtagnan who was waiting for him	61.53578567504883
Come hither said Mazarin in his softest voice I have an order to give you	37.04745101928711
DArtagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	155.39205932617188
The cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst DArtagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity	55.37315368652344
He was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	49.71291732788086
The cardinal folded and sealed his letter	42.418582916259766
Monsieur dArtagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the Bastile and bring back here the person it concerns	2337.111328125
You must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care	115.93009948730469
DArtagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drillsergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding Four men and an escort a carriage and a horse	96.76493835449219
Five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard	1671.95849609375
Chapter III	52.389068603515625
Dead Animosities	27.051782608032227
DArtagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	133.0392303466797
His visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	144.69981384277344
The governor of the Bastile was Monsieur du Tremblay the brother of the famous Capuchin Joseph that fearful favorite of Richelieus who went by the name of the Gray Cardinal	94.5294189453125
During the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the Bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other As for me I shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer As for me gentlemen I shall leave only when Monsieur du Tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal Du Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De Bassompierre regain his at court	83.4808120727539
His prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which De Bassompierre supposed for after the death of Richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison	128.85809326171875
Monsieur du Tremblay received DArtagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	202.73556518554688
I should be delighted to do so was the reply but if I am not mistaken the words In haste are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought	52.66790008544922
You are right said Du Tremblay	40.681427001953125
Halloo major tell them to order Number 25 to come downstairs	127.20669555664062
The unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a manhe became a number	63.281707763671875
DArtagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	10.349617958068848
A bell resounded	64.39854431152344
I must leave you said Du Tremblay I am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner	44.06344985961914
I shall be happy to meet you again sir	75.62418365478516
May the devil annihilate me if I return thy wish murmured DArtagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation I declare I feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard	14.866374969482422
Go to go to I would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the Bastile	14.282503128051758
He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived	40.25434112548828
On seeing him DArtagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	35.46397018432617
The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer	53.543209075927734
Gentlemen thus DArtagnan addressed the four musketeers I am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage I shall sit beside him	17.02656364440918
Monsieur de Lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please	60.4195442199707
As he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed To the Palais Royal at full trot	60.63982391357422
The carriage drove on and DArtagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner	89.89411163330078
Rochefort he exclaimed you is it you indeed I am not mistaken	270.4524230957031
DArtagnan cried Rochefort	117.45902252197266
Ah my poor friend resumed DArtagnan not having seen you for four or five years I concluded you were dead	47.93297576904297
Ifaith said Rochefort there s no great difference I think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now I have been buried alive or very nearly so	90.67890167236328
And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile	126.8421859741211
Do you wish me to speak the truth	2944.39892578125
Well then I do nt know	114.79910278320312
Have you any suspicion of me Rochefort	89.81000518798828
No on the honor of a gentleman but I can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible	134.97723388671875
What reason asked DArtagnan	46.39371109008789
For stealing	117.99252319335938
For stealing you Rochefort you are laughing at me	37.525672912597656
I understand	38.518131256103516
You mean that this demands explanation do you not	33.84678268432617
I admit it	95.84768676757812
Well this is what actually took place One evening after an orgy in Reinards apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc dHarcourt Fontrailles De Rieux and others the Duc dHarcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf that is you know a diversion which the Duc dOrleans made quite the fashion	45.6700439453125
Were you crazy Rochefort at your age	138.3895263671875
No I was drunk	17.938480377197266
And yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse	43.49174118041992
No sooner said than done	8.293911933898926
Thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything	32.5086669921875
Four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out Guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	210.3970947265625
Duc dHarcourt Fontrailles and the others escaped De Rieux was inclined to do likewise but I told him they would nt look for us where we were	260.63433837890625
He would nt listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallowsbird	34.063499450683594
I then was ready to dismount but it was too late I descended into the arms of the archers	316.77978515625
They conducted me to the Chatelet where I slept soundly being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free	91.23531341552734
The next day came and passed the day after a week I then wrote to the cardinal	54.038455963134766
The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile	59.469722747802734
That was five years ago	85.09737396240234
Do you believe it was because I committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV	69.01789855957031
No you are right my dear Rochefort it could nt be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon	52.65127944946289
Ah indeed I forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me	109.68177032470703
To the cardinal	190.66307067871094
What does he want with me	56.33015441894531
I do not know	138.9050750732422
I did not even know that you were the person I was sent to fetch	3070.6865234375
Impossibleyoua favorite of the minister	127.50456237792969
A favorite no indeed cried DArtagnan	1885.291259765625
Ah my poor friend I am just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung twentytwo years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	62.9811897277832
Nevertheless you come as one in authority	113.65631866455078
Because I happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance	196.59092712402344
I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years	114.22151184082031
Then no misfortune has happened to you	60.63311767578125
And what misfortune could happen to me To quote some Latin verses I have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and I am a valley dear Rochefortone of the lowliest of the low	6.424680233001709
Then Mazarin is still Mazarin	204.20108032226562
The same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen	144.513916015625
If not her husband he is unquestionably her lover	170.2644805908203
You surprise me	32.05030822753906
Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin	84.27275848388672
Just like the women replied DArtagnan coolly	152.2091064453125
Like women not like queens	254.6254119873047
Egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these	46.205711364746094
And M	96.45159149169922
de Beaufortis he still in prison	125.25950622558594
Oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me	119.9594497680664
You are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out	285.009521484375
And said the prisoner what talk is there of war with Spain	30.27625274658203
With Spain no answered DArtagnan but Paris	54.31587600708008
What do you mean cried Rochefort	60.45150375366211
Do you hear the guns pray The citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime	48.926788330078125
And youdo you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois	66.90200805664062
Yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body	59.83101272583008
How miserable not to be free	87.67142486572266
Do nt be downcast	330.9242248535156
Since Mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	41.31064987182617
I congratulate you Many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me so you see in what a situation I am	49.19138717651367
Make your complaints known that s my advice	85.2154541015625
Listen Rochefort let us make a compact	79.32559967041016
We are friends are we not	64.33396911621094
Egad I bear the traces of our friendshipthree slits or slashes from your sword	642.839599609375
Well if you should be restored to favor do nt forget me	90.58645629882812
On the honor of a Rochefort but you must do the like for me	7.1391730308532715
There s my handI promise	71.64629364013672
Therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf	20.010404586791992
I shall say it and you	1.1917784214019775
I shall do the same	80.33717346191406
Apropos are we to speak of your friends also Athos Porthos and Aramis or have you forgotten them	36.270164489746094
What has become of them	70.95130920410156
I do nt know we separated as you know	122.4687728881836
They are alive that s all that I can say about them from time to time I hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if I know No on my honor I have not a friend in the world but you Rochefort	110.39879608154297
And the illustriouswhats the name of the lad whom I made a sergeant in Piedmonts regiment	46.85021209716797
The illustrious Planchet	223.93162536621094
What has become of him	56.514068603515625
I should nt wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment	28.498323440551758
He married a woman who keeps a confectioners shop in the Rue des Lombards for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats he s now a citizen of Paris	64.62637329101562
You ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before I shall be a captain	8852.5849609375
Come dear DArtagnan look up a little Courage It is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merrygoround wheels and rewards us	151.78604125976562
This evening your destiny begins to change	179.30355834960938
Amen exclaimed DArtagnan stopping the carriage	89.16912078857422
What are you doing asked Rochefort	39.645973205566406
We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other	217.8243408203125
You are right	80.70010375976562
Au revoir	64.21578979492188
Remember your promise	41.933753967285156
In five minutes the party entered the courtyard and DArtagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and antechamber	55.79728317260742
As they stopped at the door of the cardinals study DArtagnan was about to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder	140.52627563476562
DArtagnan let me confess to you what I ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes	118.50801849365234
Speak out answered DArtagnan	111.5
I had only to cry out Help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then I should have been free	74.99446105957031
Why did nt you do it asked the lieutenant	74.71669006347656
Come come cried Rochefort	76.03668212890625
Did we not swear friendship Ah had any one but you been there I do nt say	41.36289596557617
DArtagnan bowed	20.22515296936035
Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man than I am he said to himself	155.7630615234375
And he caused himself to be announced to the minister	66.40751647949219
Let M	17.221445083618164
de Rochefort enter said Mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg M	51.51286315917969
dArtagnan to wait I shall have further need of him	23.595529556274414
These words gave great joy to DArtagnan	40.594974517822266
As he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign	33.30974578857422
Rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found Mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church his costume being similar to that of the abbs in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet	54.135887145996094
As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister	87.9896011352539
There was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	105.12859344482422
But Rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct Cardinal Richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility	126.29093933105469
As he gazed at him Mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say This is a man who does not appear to me fit for much	73.58786010742188
After a pause which appeared an age to Rochefort Mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said	89.97748565673828
I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty Monsieur de Rochefort	33.010066986083984
You are in prison then	253.11187744140625
Rochefort trembled in every limb at this question	86.54498291015625
But I thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one	77.88732147216797
I Oh no There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile who were cooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu I do nt even know their names	272.5705261230469
Yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your eminence	68.3519058227539
You think you were	284.7793884277344
I am certain of it	213.16241455078125
Ah stay I fancy I remember it	70.76028442382812
Did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to Brussels for the queen	176.17575073242188
Ah ah exclaimed Rochefort	50.64762878417969
There is the true reason Idiot that I am though I have been trying to find it out for five years I never found it out	49.903892517089844
But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment	2704.484375
I merely ask you did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal	132.2459716796875
That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels	142.7019500732422
I was there at a fearful moment	47.91391372680664
I was sent there to intercept a correspondence between Chalais and the archduke and even then when I was discovered I was nearly torn to pieces	219.25311279296875
How could I then return to Brussels I should injure the queen instead of serving her	109.07088470458984
Well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusala distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen	27.722440719604492
Rochefort smiled contemptuously	36.68659210205078
Since I was a faithful servant my lord to Cardinal Richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death I should serve you well in defiance of the whole world	78.59138488769531
With regard to myself Monsieur de Rochefort replied Mazarin I am not like Monsieur de Richelieu allpowerful	29.99985122680664
I am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queens	88.58081817626953
Now the queen is of a sensitive nature	202.73712158203125
Hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the Bastile	47.998844146728516
But your release can be managed	27.185205459594727
You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy	64.7408218383789
Such was Cardinal Richelieus opinion my lord	149.20945739746094
The cardinal interrupted Mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me	42.67706298828125
I am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage	82.4654769897461
I am of a frankness of character quite French	251.36618041992188
Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	128.545166015625
Now to the point	66.86740112304688
I want friends I want faithful servants	223.82923889160156
When I say I want I mean the queen wants them	25.134075164794922
I do nothing without her commandspray understand that not like Monsieur de Richelieu who went on just as he pleased	49.00825500488281
So I shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that I shall be a good man Monsieur de Rochefort and I hope to prove it to you	67.92005157470703
Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers	781.7994384765625
I am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though I have had but little evidence of that goodnature of which your eminence speaks	128.97569274902344
Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison	104.6400146484375
Ah Monsieur de Rochefort have I not told you already that I had nothing to do with that The queencannot you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess But that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten	102.60498809814453
I can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal but I who have passed those years in the Bastile	352.7603454589844
Ah mon Dieu my dear Monsieur de Rochefort do you absolutely think that the Palais Royal is the abode of gayety No	113.5023422241211
We have had great annoyances there	143.35305786132812
As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always do	71.89752960205078
Let us come to some conclusion	150.9408721923828
Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort	95.26127624511719
I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about everything	30.704862594604492
In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierres party	154.01797485351562
Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France	216.82298278808594
He is dead sir a great loss	177.38150024414062
His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce	11.031027793884277
I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bastile	14.139357566833496
However there are plenty in the world but you do nt look in the right direction for them my lord	283.12860107421875
Indeed explain to me	65.56024932861328
Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great man	39.49022674560547
Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson	20.366044998168945
I never you know you may say anything to me	23.497968673706055
I try to be beloved not feared	117.72355651855469
Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like servant	30.178571701049805
Pray what does that mean	16.6159610748291
It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them	47.0369873046875
He the point aimed at by every poniard Richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him	97.01446533203125
But he did ward them off said De Rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends	171.57778930664062
I have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of DArtagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon	494.402099609375
But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him	166.8728790283203
No in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	99.9746322631836
They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants	36.75588607788086
But how is it that you know so much of these matters	165.89646911621094
I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because I did them all the harm I could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom I had most to do gave me a pretty swordthrust now about seven years ago the third that I received from the same hand it closed an old account	78.67868041992188
Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men	201.98399353027344
My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you	66.59378814697266
Who is it	177.41490173339844
It is Monsieur dArtagnan	134.68431091308594
That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted surprise	54.06267166137695
That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro	149.33238220214844
It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency	332.23431396484375
Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Rochefort	239.47723388671875
That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a smile	21.992162704467773
Then he will tell it me himself	128.38320922851562
I doubt it my lord	186.78150939941406
Why do you doubt it	165.56227111816406
Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great queen	20.787132263183594
And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that	46.724239349365234
No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now	279.1759338378906
And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united	33.01792907714844
As if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast	23.12912368774414
You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole story	22.641965866088867
That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my lord	22.10131072998047
Pray do so I delight in stories cried the cardinal	153.53541564941406
Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals motive	128.8028106689453
Once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well	121.06575012207031
Do not try my lord you can not guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned	131.4227752685547
There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	166.63426208496094
As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place	68.24837493896484
There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas	89.83643341064453
This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high estate	57.94537353515625
Well my lord four men resolved to save her	26.953481674194336
These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich	153.52340698242188
They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it	21.22959327697754
They set out	32.383853912353516
The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination	33.027061462402344
Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him	139.49427795410156
He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister	156.5144500732422
What do you think of that exploit my lord	64.3523178100586
It is magnificent said Mazarin thoughtfully	38.83214569091797
Well I know of ten such men	25.21307945251465
Mazarin made no reply he reflected	65.8546142578125
Five or six minutes elapsed	81.97024536132812
You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Rochefort	23.012041091918945
And you say that Monsieur dArtagnan was one of those four men	138.13595581054688
He led the enterprise	33.05160903930664
And who were the others	22.368059158325195
I leave it to Monsieur dArtagnan to name them my lord	71.96170043945312
They were his friends and not mine	355.4024963378906
He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true names	57.757266998291016
You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid me	12.221896171569824
Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones destination	528.42822265625
You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for me	27.959190368652344
Well what is the matter	264.2076721191406
The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment	73.16387176513672
What impossible And why is it impossible	107.43634796142578
Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of his	84.72943878173828
Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen	56.91404342651367
Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State	119.03022766113281
That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I can not accept your offer	53.92979049682617
This then is what you call devotion I congratulate you	70.99598693847656
Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Rochefort	2.000459671020508
And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change ones prison	34.31492614746094
Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Mazarin	138.24461364746094
My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one partyI am for fresh air	270.3028869628906
Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads	54.92379379272461
My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you	115.03922271728516
Believe me you ought now to take a rest	269.8440246582031
You decide then nothing about me my lord	57.59684371948242
On the contrary I have come to a decision	6.820319175720215
Bernouin came into the room	30.842880249023438
Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone	41.17383575439453
The officer entered	67.29371643066406
Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	45.778011322021484
Adieu Monsieur de Rochefort he said	116.6290054321289
Rochefort bent low	64.69746398925781
I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bastile	135.29832458496094
You are sagacious	489.96246337890625
I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me	218.3669891357422
You the friend of my greatest foes Do nt suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Rochefort	17.412132263183594
I shall find many men as able as you are	259.1225280761719
I wish you may my lord replied De Rochefort	1191.5458984375
He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where DArtagnan was waiting	253.82763671875
In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend	284.4413146972656
Ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin that we are still thank God good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of fiveandtwenty	50.11772918701172
Chapter IV	75.27627563476562
Anne of Austria at the Age of Fortysix	52.92176055908203
When left alone with Bernouin Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	189.12277221679688
He had gained much information but not enough	22.467601776123047
Mazarin was a cheat at the cardtable	78.59490966796875
This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne	117.61487579345703
He called it using his advantages	289.065185546875
He now determined not to begin the game with DArtagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys cards	108.99046325683594
My lord have you any commands asked Bernouin	144.015869140625
Yes yes replied Mazarin	92.15986633300781
Light me I am going to the queen	74.6365737915039
Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	58.787445068359375
There was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of Austria	74.64692687988281
This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal	11.995180130004883
In the bedroom in which this passage ended Bernouin encountered Madame de Beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare Anne of Austria who was in her oratory with the young king Louis XIV	200.85968017578125
to receive the cardinal	44.39649200439453
Anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures	64.87364196777344
This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity	31.07236671447754
It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying	75.49864959716797
When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother	54.41409683227539
Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience	96.31476593017578
Anne colored slightly	52.904930114746094
The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court	70.31961059570312
But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy	16.21767234802246
How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such things	43.53468322753906
I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about it	62.50373077392578
And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impatience	166.55020141601562
I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing further	123.7802963256836
At this very moment Mazarin entered	58.670135498046875
The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand also	82.49847412109375
Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance	169.5451202392578
They explained what had occurred that evening	12.475369453430176
He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis XIV	51.852176666259766
had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civility	58.440879821777344
Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	42.971717834472656
The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais	72.81208038330078
It is time for the king to go to bed call Laporte	166.84510803222656
The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger	77.26174926757812
In a few minutes Laporte came into the room	258.7391662597656
The child went directly to him without kissing his mother	319.4363708496094
Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me	47.494144439697266
I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away	76.95811462402344
I do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you	63.81870651245117
You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion	79.59980773925781
Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle	77.45175170898438
To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Mancini	9.326640129089355
Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarins and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister	58.15909957885742
And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal	70.09555053710938
Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation	94.70162963867188
Why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly	40.64925765991211
Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	143.904052734375
Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	95.89970397949219
That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your majesty	64.89647674560547
I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you	266.7689514160156
The cardinal smiled	1.0454856157302856
But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose	154.27362060546875
What is it then	110.00982666015625
Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	50.79134750366211
It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy	161.2045440673828
Why cried the queen how is that	83.5212631225586
Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our bonds	69.53514099121094
You jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	67.64083862304688
Alas I do not madame rejoined Mazarin	57.095726013183594
Mark well what I say	35.5523681640625
The whole world conspires to break our bonds	142.19190979003906
Now as you are one of the whole world I mean to say that you also are deserting me	167.30335998535156
Heavens did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans or rather at what he said	800.339599609375
And what was he saying	75.92766571044922
He said this madame Mazarin is a stumblingblock	206.9317169189453
Send him away and all will then be well	40.67006301879883
What do you wish me to do	165.46701049804688
Oh madame you are the queen	61.601871490478516
Queen forsooth when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom	451.5140686035156
Nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like	84.57435607910156
That is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	249.40919494628906
I persons whom I do not like	21.889421463012695
Yes indeed	163.39154052734375
Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign	378.6555480957031
A woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M	23.051780700683594
de Richelieu	6.311748504638672
Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine	109.03194427490234
A prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal	36.837379455566406
Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested	34.0088005065918
An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me	72.15755462646484
You see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine	45.39899826049805
That is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine	139.35293579101562
My friends monsieur The queen shook her head	207.53421020507812
Alas I have them no longer	608.1890258789062
How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity	87.731689453125
It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends monsieur because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at Cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son	200.6378936767578
Well let us see said Mazarin is nt there still time to repair the evil Search among your friends your oldest friends	18.68571662902832
What do you mean monsieur	37.67168045043945
Nothing else than I saysearch	338.8221130371094
Alas I look around me in vain I have no influence with any one	150.50094604492188
Monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was Choisy today it is La Riviere tomorrow it will be some one else	37.59904479980469
Monsieur le Prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by Madame de Guemenee	160.90357971191406
Therefore madame I ask you to look not among your friends of today but among those of other times	37.48065185546875
Among my friends of other times said the queen	84.89873504638672
Yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him	9.31272029876709
What is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	93.343017578125
Yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary	397.0337219238281
I said the queen	397.4856872558594
I suffered that is all	10.03691577911377
Yes said Mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	97.70670318603516
Come let us come to the point	94.39249420166016
Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort	15.418367385864258
One of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of Cardinal Richelieu	114.74153137207031
I know that and we sent him to the Bastile said Mazarin	15.041116714477539
Is he at liberty asked the queen	346.2454528808594
No still there but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce the name of another man	69.53221893310547
Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	151.09555053710938
Anne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart	73.83424377441406
Has the Gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud	60.812461853027344
DArtagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	148.7423858642578
DArtagnan there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women	83.074462890625
Poor young creature she was poisoned on my account	158.20065307617188
That s all you know of him asked Mazarin	293.1448669433594
The queen looked at him surprised	62.698116302490234
You seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of crossexamination	289.40252685546875
Which you answer according to your fancy replied Mazarin	53.94815444946289
Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them	12.992816925048828
The queen spoke with some impatience	323.3648986816406
Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given me	67.31365203857422
The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly	116.08409881591797
Still said the queen	83.4389877319336
I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beaufort	113.36538696289062
Yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water	189.32579040527344
There is however a proverb current in France relating to water which is quiet	117.46617889404297
Continue said the queen	136.2377471923828
Well then madame not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days	367.5116271972656
We have arrested Monsieur de Beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them	173.55706787109375
There is the Prince de Cond	138.23097229003906
The hero of Rocroy	50.64150619506836
Do you think of him	84.1229248046875
Yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in Italy next after Monsieur de Cond comes the Duke of Orleans	93.14508056640625
What are you saying The first prince of the blood the kings uncle	233.66099548339844
No not the first prince of the blood not the kings uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the bloodnot the prince nearest to the throne not the kings uncle I repeat but the murderer of Chalais of Montmorency and of CinqMars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversaryinstead of a man who threatened a man who smiles	180.2749786376953
But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point	426.0788879394531
Anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	294.03033447265625
What am I to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	64.62834167480469
Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to Buckingham	197.20872497558594
Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she said	34.916542053222656
I wish continued Mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut I wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover	326.2322692871094
Again that accusation cried the queen	374.9764404296875
I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you	53.79164505004883
Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning courage	29.956693649291992
I will tell you all replied Anne	113.42752075195312
Listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor	70.97476196289062
Ah you confess it exclaimed Mazarin	61.30739974975586
Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir and can not women be dishonored by appearances Yes appearances were against me and I was about to suffer dishonor	86.52200317382812
However I swear I was not guilty I swear it by	79.62692260742188
The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar	54.200462341308594
I swear she said by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my lover	6.2291364669799805
What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin smiling	88.55024719238281
I am incredulous	182.51649475097656
The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal	184.17083740234375
Open sir she said and look for yourself	135.10903930664062
Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	54.15644836425781
What are these things he asked	62.12962341308594
What are these things replied Anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	195.85848999023438
These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to him	425.4927673339844
This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed him	115.25566864013672
Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth	30.952171325683594
But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen	8695.6865234375
The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder	41.32377243041992
It is well madame I believe your oath	88.15397644042969
No no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read I command you for I am resolved that everything shall be finished tonight and never will I recur to this subject again	86.9074478149414
Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations	108.61365509033203
Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters	29.551651000976562
In one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	2.000459671020508
This letter had been conveyed by DArtagnan and had arrived in time	30.838411331176758
The other was that which Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	42.14990234375
It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony	24.242752075195312
Sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that I have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat I have given nothing to that gallant officer DArtagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond	67.57623291015625
As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	54.69834518432617
It appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked it	231.06398010253906
I bought it from him but it belongs to DArtagnan	25.015382766723633
Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful	42.72282409667969
Thank you madame said Mazarin	185.5946807861328
I will profit by the advice	25.28827667236328
And now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me	53.328895568847656
Nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	1331.2916259765625
I love you so tenderly that I can not help being jealous even of the past	214.024169921875
A smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	12.782726287841797
Since you have no further interrogations to make leave me I beseech you she said	56.5489501953125
I wish after such a scene to be alone	62.332679748535156
Mazarin bent low before her	38.662208557128906
I will retire madame	89.27083587646484
Do you permit me to return	101.93732452392578
Yes tomorrow	14.975805282592773
The cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips	193.53079223632812
Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed	97.16390991210938
Laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	108.4361572265625
Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to Laporte	79.79058074951172
Try my dear Laporte to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le Cardinal to whom both he and I are under such important obligations	1771.67138671875
Chapter V	36.63752746582031
The Gascon and the Italian	81.60820770263672
Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone	80.58032989501953
When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	27.793752670288086
There DArtagnan was asleep upon a bench	182.47769165039062
The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	75.3038558959961
DArtagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms	72.30561828613281
Here I am said he	73.87738800048828
Who calls me	23.638282775878906
I said Mazarin with his most smiling expression	21.666706085205078
I ask pardon of your eminence said DArtagnan but I was so fatigued	114.70952606201172
Do nt ask my pardon monsieur said Mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service	26.523082733154297
DArtagnan admired Mazarins gracious manner	74.53773498535156
Ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps	193.87596130371094
Follow me monsieur said Mazarin	49.05605697631836
Come come murmured DArtagnan Rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of Rochefort	49.12357711791992
Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man	45.3279914855957
Possibly thought DArtagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarins compliment	561.859375
Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor	130.70867919921875
There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarins purpose	131.50369262695312
Order my lord he said I am ready to obey your eminence	122.89564514160156
Monsieur dArtagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign	45.07832717895508
Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	214.81776428222656
It is true I fought with tolerable success	68.23616790771484
I do nt speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others	79.40178680419922
DArtagnan pretended astonishment	51.650394439697266
Well you do not reply resumed Mazarin	6.180846214294434
I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak	105.05878448486328
I speak of the adventureEh you know well what I mean	49.58959197998047
Alas no my lord replied DArtagnan surprised	67.29576873779297
You are discreetso much the better	35.1280517578125
I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends	47.152854919433594
Aha thought the Gascon is this a snare or not Let me be on my guard	98.98603820800781
And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied	9.313450813293457
Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I wanted	256.2006530761719
Come let us see what you will do for me	50.54841995239258
Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	199.38319396972656
You will do for me what you have done for the queen	100.90785217285156
Certainly DArtagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	152.09207153320312
He s not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud	196.96644592285156
The queen my lord I do nt comprehend	87.90006256103516
You do nt comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me	43.69480895996094
Which of my friends my lord	57.331298828125
Your three friendsthe friends of former days	187.98281860351562
Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones friend	38.448341369628906
Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too prudent	631.287841796875
My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues	58.046058654785156
But you have been silent for twenty years sir	66.4718017578125
Speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise	21.65462875366211
The queen said DArtagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended	191.5109100341797
Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know	128.58815002441406
And so saying Mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased from Monsieur des Essarts	98.58719635009766
Tis true	71.73965454101562
I remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen	49.575496673583984
You see then that I speak to you in the queens name	54.896507263183594
Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so doing	204.12464904785156
Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me	48.0496826171875
We need only a week to amend all that	86.33975219726562
Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends	33.0303955078125
I do not know my lord	102.026611328125
We have parted company this long time all three have left the service	60.32353973388672
Where can you find them then	39.68326950073242
Wherever they are that s my business	283.2801208496094
Well now what are your conditions if I employ you	64.45513153076172
Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require	62.592193603515625
I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road	60.8061408996582
The devil he does Money and a large sum said Mazarin	95.5191421508789
Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury	365.3530578613281
Do then as I did my lord	71.58697509765625
Sell the crown diamonds	43.618900299072266
Trust me do nt let us try to do things cheaply	6.245054244995117
Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means	56.42281723022461
Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy you	116.23580932617188
Richelieu thought DArtagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance	82.49847412109375
You will then be at my service asked Mazarin	276.4223937988281
Yes if my friends agree	588.0527954101562
But if they refuse can I count on you	26.298696517944336
I have never accomplished anything alone said DArtagnan shaking his head	107.25386810302734
Go then and find them	119.00173950195312
What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence	45.14925003051758
You know them better than I	54.567813873291016
Adapt your promises to their respective characters	203.09716796875
What shall I promise	76.51988983154297
That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent	92.90018463134766
But what are we to do	42.199466705322266
Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your friends	58.62033462524414
My lord perhaps they are not in Paris	29.06290054321289
It is even probable that I shall have to make a journey	75.95783233642578
I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	2.000459671020508
My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment	181.5587158203125
Still my lord I ca nt travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I ca nt travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service I have accumulated nothing but debts	191.2268524169922
Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to DArtagnan	26.88975715637207
Take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey	67.35031127929688
If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought DArtagnan we shall yet be able to do business together	84.7549819946289
He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	207.6717987060547
Well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	309.46063232421875
Yes my lord	82.76057434082031
Apropos what are the names of your friends	36.14397048950195
The Count de la Fere formerly styled Athos Monsieur du Vallon whom we used to call Porthos the Chevalier dHerblay now the Abb dHerblay whom we styled Aramis	356.39508056640625
The cardinal smiled	106.6679916381836
Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names	95.91658782958984
Long swords but light purses	280.4875793457031
Was that it	178.6576690673828
If God willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said DArtagnan I shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all Europe if you like	89.04161071777344
These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effrontery	86.80461120605469
At all events answered DArtagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords	205.72503662109375
He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	466.3874206542969
Crown pieces onlysilver pieces I suspected it	74.94380187988281
Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it	86.70077514648438
Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction	14.804734230041504
A hundred pistoles a hundred pistoles for a hundred pistoles I have discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamondhe cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to DArtagnanwhich is worth at least ten thousand francs	251.00230407714844
He returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to Bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gunfire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through Paris	90.91134643554688
In the meantime DArtagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette	1303.9263916015625
We will explain in a few words how DArtagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	147.44024658203125
Chapter VI	57.52852249145508
DArtagnan in his Fortieth Year	375.2266845703125
Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of DArtagnan at No	98.92408752441406
12 Rue des Fossoyeurs	261.5232238769531
DArtagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	108.83450317382812
So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character	451.3044128417969
He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others	185.4091033935547
Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his elegance	207.4871063232422
Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	44.09256362915039
Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	691.4189453125
From that day DArtagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from Heaven	57.296592712402344
Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers DArtagnan felt completely solitary	41.97545623779297
For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced	70.1319580078125
A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly DArtagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	118.4471664428711
His early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	261.8203125
These important advantages DArtagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe	91.32445526123047
From the time DArtagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman twentyfive or twentysix years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times DArtagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	102.5022964477539
He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him	79.66068267822266
Therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by DArtagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to DArtagnan that he should marry her	11.70276927947998
Ah fie DArtagnan replied	55.587013244628906
Bigamy my dear Come now you do nt really wish it	91.18417358398438
But he is dead I am sure of it	18.80722427368164
He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged	535.3082275390625
All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave	662.4849853515625
Peste my darling another way of getting hanged	187.9876708984375
So you refuse my request	46.65154266357422
To be sure I dofuriously	214.19271850585938
The pretty landlady was desolate	115.21769714355469
She would have taken DArtagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache	292.7650451660156
Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of FrancheComte	35.26871109008789
DArtagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	33.52558517456055
There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the hostess	31.963048934936523
DArtagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name	47.63263702392578
As to that we know DArtagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle	178.015625
He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion	57.654850006103516
One believes readily what he wishes to believe	88.79607391357422
Now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones death	55.229671478271484
But DArtagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that	39.47763442993164
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	31.929195404052734
He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France	2028.292724609375
He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for France	20.63306427001953
Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne	158.4759521484375
But DArtagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	140.27415466308594
He has returned said he	37.67001724243164
So much the worse and so much the better	82.4920654296875
It need not be said that DArtagnan was still thinking of the husband	92.72276306152344
He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk	55.15750503540039
Alone asked DArtagnan	77.44210815429688
With monsieur	61.72642517089844
Monsieur has returned then	55.172447204589844
Of course naively replied the servant	44.14023971557617
If I had any money said DArtagnan to himself I would go away but I have none	92.9587631225586
I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition	107.04642486572266
He had just completed this monologuewhich proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologuewhen the servantmaid watching at the door suddenly cried out	226.7186737060547
Ah see here is madame returning with monsieur	146.663330078125
DArtagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend Porthos	130.3024444580078
Is that monsieur said DArtagnan to himself	55.982662200927734
Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to me	58.736759185791016
And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place	13.223023414611816
The hostess as she entered saw DArtagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon DArtagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	48.955352783203125
The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	250.05630493164062
Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great distress	258.4468078613281
Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said DArtagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing	48.91377258300781
And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great coldness	87.0101547241211
Who is that man he asked	32.862274169921875
The hostess replied only by gasps	83.65718841552734
Who is that Swiss asked DArtagnan	123.6615982055664
Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps	39.59476089477539
Your husband then is at last dead	63.42723083496094
How does that concern you replied the Swiss	51.77589416503906
It concerns me much said DArtagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since	179.82371520996094
And since asked the Swiss	123.77143859863281
And sinceI do not give it said the musketeer	68.04891204833984
The Swiss became as purple as a peony	59.59147262573242
He wore his elegant uniform DArtagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high DArtagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded DArtagnan as an intruder	107.58849334716797
Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry	105.26940155029297
I By no means said DArtagnan	29.153738021850586
Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large	136.29733276367188
DArtagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction	189.82322692871094
Stay you where you are and do nt you stir or I will pull this ear off	106.00077819824219
As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging	111.54887390136719
The Swiss began to laugh boisterously	96.63845825195312
I go out he said	82.52546691894531
And why	56.60187911987305
Ah very well said DArtagnan I see that you understand French	150.8684844970703
Come then and take a turn with me and I will explain	19.567230224609375
The hostess who knew DArtagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	67.80440521240234
DArtagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away madame	137.78689575195312
Pooh said the Swiss who had needed a little time to take in DArtagnans proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you	204.55726623535156
I am lieutenant in his majestys musketeers said DArtagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is not of rank but of quartersyou know the customcome and seek for yours the first to return will recover his chamber	347.62567138671875
DArtagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand	48.59512710571289
It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle	345.7196960449219
DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword	183.41879272460938
Then you will lie here said DArtagnan	105.24390411376953
It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it	141.01918029785156
With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary	46.51517868041992
He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force	68.05514526367188
The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down	241.24952697753906
There said DArtagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you wo nt be laid up more than a fortnight	55.69016647338867
Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the boy	98.17578887939453
Goodby Oh by the way you d better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote	257.43505859375
You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same	164.2999267578125
Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to him	72.7552261352539
The boy found him sitting where DArtagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary	39.38399887084961
The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for DArtagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors	148.99887084960938
But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman	292.2402038574219
As for you you have acted like a barmaid	156.24703979492188
So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage	90.40677642822266
I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no longer	54.37907028198242
I will not sleep where I must scorn	120.747802734375
Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid dAmour Rue des Bourdonnais	69.18087005615234
Adieu madame	73.89824676513672
In saying these words DArtagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	155.1583251953125
The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence	103.2776107788086
What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept DArtagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love	43.18330764770508
He pardoned and having pardoned he remained	66.02987670898438
And this explains how DArtagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chevrette	75.84805297851562
DArtagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	88.78459930419922
Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected I would turn it at once into money I would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my fathers chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the Cemetery des Innocents and I should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me	52.04964828491211
Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abb like Aramis	69.96138763427734
Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who wo nt dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor	92.64386749267578
On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house	44.44398880004883
Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected	68.97286224365234
The people were shouting and running about with torches	67.59795379638672
By the light of one of these torches DArtagnan perceived men in uniform	104.8031005859375
He asked what was going on	80.47434997558594
He was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinals bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched	152.78369140625
In his youth DArtagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word	148.40672302246094
There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burgundy	233.00408935546875
He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	37.891544342041016
He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	44.55503845214844
His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table	112.1388168334961
Not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	153.66798400878906
No DArtagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time	84.97187805175781
He was hungry he supped he went to bed	49.34539794921875
Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it	183.81735229492188
In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything	494.3292541503906
It was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night long	83.74578857421875
At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	176.38009643554688
In 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Athos	103.65088653564453
Where was I then Let me see	85.1282958984375
Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the trenches	137.36187744140625
He told melet me thinkwhat was it That he was living on a small estatebut where I was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away I suppose to the Spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about Athos	42.40077209472656
Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him too	27.109683990478516
He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September 1646	69.77041625976562
Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me there	33.77279281616211
I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April 1647 and as the invitation was for September 1646 I could nt accept it	99.9016342163086
Let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds	1995.4696044921875
DArtagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family	130.5417022705078
He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse	90.71397399902344
DArtagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vallon	69.57149505615234
Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon	102.67860412597656
Devil take the vain fellow said DArtagnan	47.895538330078125
However I had better find him out first since he ca nt want money	56.55388259887695
Athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	120.0243911743164
Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion	118.72027587890625
He cast his eyes again on the letter	57.44467544555664
There was a postscript	64.07096099853516
I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his convent	36.813053131103516
In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name	105.7192153930664
Ah if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits when we were at Crevecoeur I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron	77.85446166992188
Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of Achilles	31.214853286743164
But no I should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	61.342342376708984
Great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right	27.89385223388672
But let us wait a little and reflect	79.01995849609375
I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered him	37.86613845825195
Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter	68.75106048583984
DArtagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	40.41754913330078
He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail	144.3972930908203
He felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of Aramis	13.870183944702148
Monsieur DArtagnan You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the Place Royale	118.99895477294922
As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as second	25.922534942626953
You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary	255.6837921142578
I shall be with mine under the third	32.114227294921875
Wholly yours	52.30293655395508
DArtagnan tried to recall his remembrances	250.60922241210938
He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair	220.16006469726562
It is over Aramis had said	38.92084884643555
I think I have killed the insolent fellow	19.667282104492188
But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to you	660.0614624023438
Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	23.919391632080078
So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	76.7716293334961
He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	20.74165153503418
He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window	84.0718765258789
Ah you scoundrel cried DArtagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword	119.50396728515625
Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and do nt kill me unheard	48.894874572753906
I m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	130.43759155273438
My name isah but surely you are Monsieur dArtagnan	52.425819396972656
And thouPlanchet cried the lieutenant	131.09962463378906
At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving you	109.59844207763672
Perhaps so replied DArtagnan	108.0573959350586
But why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the morning in the month of January	207.30642700195312
Sir said Planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know	89.4455795288086
Tell us what returned DArtagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains	108.31088256835938
Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort	10.809029579162598
Perfectly one of my dearest friends	292.0245666503906
Ah so much the better	45.09446334838867
But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room	73.70630645751953
Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is	185.47665405273438
Planchet hesitated	49.9935188293457
Egad I know where he is said DArtagnan	49.534820556640625
He s in the Bastile	6.215536117553711
That is to say he was there replied Planchet	73.91970825195312
But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them	111.00769805908203
The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help	24.115697860717773
I was there	35.67216110229492
I heard the name of Rochefort	111.88490295410156
I remembered him well	28.992656707763672
I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for help	11.957723617553711
The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd	89.21220397949219
At this moment a patrol passed by	92.3804702758789
I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two mattresses	163.7365264892578
This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and	250.6077880859375
Well interrupted DArtagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without mercy	128.82388305664062
Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an asylum	39.335296630859375
Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for you	51.135902404785156
Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it Planchet	3.0082876682281494
I have not forgotten all I owe thee	10010.3544921875
Sit down there and eat in security	60.87957000732422
I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper	89.22806549072266
Yes sir for all I ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it	70.91386413574219
Although I do nt despise sweet things in proper time and place I found the supper rather light	261.69873046875
Poor fellow said DArtagnan	27.985919952392578
Well come set to	43.71876907348633
Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planchet	655.1553344726562
And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst DArtagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances	40.681312561035156
While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table	181.40399169921875
At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	73.78507995605469
Come said DArtagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is	221.248779296875
No sir replied Planchet	34.504634857177734
The devil thou dost not Dost know where Porthos is	87.39208221435547
Nonot at all	271.05072021484375
And Aramis	125.29469299316406
Not in the least	336.7359924316406
The devil the devil the devil	25.004697799682617
But sir said Planchet with a look of shrewdness I know where Bazin is	360.013427734375
Where is he	61.64394760131836
At Notre Dame	39.37845230102539
What has he to do at Notre Dame	39.43077850341797
He is beadle	62.608787536621094
Bazin beadle at Notre Dame He must know where his master is	39.91792678833008
Without a doubt he must	2.000459671020508
DArtagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out	235.62716674804688
Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief	262.5436706542969
True said DArtagnan	186.98814392089844
Lets see	404.1182556152344
Canst thou speak any patois	127.30159759521484
I can do something better than that sir I can speak Flemish	100.40896606445312
Where the devil didst thou learn it	103.05545806884766
In Artois where I fought for years	190.75672912597656
Listen sir	97.94306182861328
Goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand	261.2297058105469
Which means	46.498390197753906
Goodday sir I am anxious to know the state of your health	65.58448028564453
He calls that a language But never mind that will do capitally	198.2870635986328
DArtagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come upstairs	525.5557250976562
When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planchet	110.83511352539062
My dear landlady said DArtagnan I beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into my service	1235.574462890625
My brother	141.87704467773438
Wish your sister goodmorning Master Peter	32.66538619995117
Wilkom suster said Planchet	44.300453186035156
Goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	35.4655647277832
This is the case said DArtagnan this is your brother Madeleine you do nt know him perhaps but I know him he has arrived from Amsterdam	112.40033721923828
You must dress him up during my absence	49.33824157714844
When I return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he does nt speak a word of French I take him into my service	210.3826446533203
You understand	37.72734451293945
That is to say I guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said Madeleine	77.80535888671875
You are a precious creature my pretty hostess and I am much obliged to you	104.9655532836914
The next moment DArtagnan was on his way to Notre Dame	24.040861129760742
Chapter VII	29.400205612182617
Touches upon the Strange Effects a Halfpistole may have	44.95093536376953
DArtagnan as he crossed the Pont Neuf congratulated himself on having found Planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the situation which he held in Rue des Lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	76.5568618774414
It was like having a spy in the enemys camp	113.83340454101562
In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself DArtagnan reached Notre Dame	46.166786193847656
He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Bazin	21.072429656982422
Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the verger	28.742353439331055
There he is attending mass in the chapel of the Virgin	250.06202697753906
DArtagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end	60.959251403808594
He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin	52.20293045043945
Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	280.254150390625
It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silvermounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshals baton which Cond threw or did not throw into the enemys line of battle at Fribourg	331.548583984375
His person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical	49.54450607299805
The striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows	62.31169891357422
The officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst DArtagnan was looking at Bazin he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of DArtagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous Jean Francois Gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving	73.14293670654297
It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended	42.97200393676758
A sacerdotal officer	23.346439361572266
DArtagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when Bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking in all humility the very last DArtagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe	10.392277717590332
Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent	58.0325813293457
Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas	342.4185485839844
So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend	137.0279083251953
Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so	108.21537780761719
I do nt understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said DArtagnan	53.28753662109375
You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church	80.47093200683594
My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said DArtagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in everything	32.401390075683594
Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine	279.1592712402344
Rather say to take him back with you into the world	35.280921936035156
Fortunately I do nt know where he is	215.9628448486328
How cried DArtagnan you do nt know where Aramis is	94.11137390136719
Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perdition	125355.1171875
By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a demon	901.9754638671875
Happily for him he has ceased to bear that name	63.2957763671875
And therefore said DArtagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not Aramis I seek but the Abb dHerblay	1426.299072265625
Come my dear Bazin tell me where he is	53.23967361450195
Did nt you hear me tell you Monsieur dArtagnan that I do nt know where he is	1512.9200439453125
Yes certainly but to that I answer that it is impossible	187.90771484375
It is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good God	51.506282806396484
DArtagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	7.431787490844727
Well Bazin said DArtagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	63.29975509643555
Accept this halfpistole to drink to my health	100.15834045410156
I do not drinkBazin pushed away with dignity the officers handtis good only for the laity	150.24159240722656
Incorruptible murmured DArtagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him	112.60337829589844
DArtagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	77.32694244384766
He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence	269.5910339355469
You here Rochefort he said in a low voice	73.70247650146484
Hush returned Rochefort	42.52259063720703
Did you know that I am at liberty	146.9886016845703
I knew it from the fountainheadfrom Planchet	763.3228149414062
And what brought you here	31.07880401611328
I came to thank God for my happy deliverance said Rochefort	27.21478843688965
And nothing more I suppose that is not all	185.02984619140625
To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up Mazarin a little	114.00424194335938
A bad plan you ll be shut up again in the Bastile	158.19544982910156
Oh as to that I shall take care I assure you	349.2126159667969
The air the fresh free air is so good besides and Rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke I am going into the country to make a tour	28.532489776611328
Stop cried DArtagnan I too am going	35.362152099609375
And if I may without impertinence askwhere are you going	1183.2867431640625
To seek my friends	169.4764862060547
What friends	55.24557876586914
Those that you asked about yesterday	43.569114685058594
Athos Porthos and Aramisyou are looking for them	150.33827209472656
On honor	141.60520935058594
What then is there surprising in that	534.70361328125
Queer though	317.55670166015625
And in whose behalf are you looking for them	189.73228454589844
You are in no doubt on that score	41.47771453857422
That is true	186.12322998046875
Unfortunately I have no idea where they are	333.3101501464844
And you have no way to get news of them Wait a week and I myself will give you some	103.52108764648438
A week is too long	35.38574981689453
I must find them within three days	14.574736595153809
Three days are a short time and France is large	86.96805572509766
No matter you know the word must with that word great things are done	48.90348815917969
And when do you set out	62.38807678222656
I am now on my road	44.916770935058594
Good luck to you	56.89887237548828
And to youa good journey	152.79556274414062
Perhaps we shall meet on our road	201.69573974609375
That is not probable	64.4223861694336
Who knows Chance is so capricious	143.65065002441406
Adieu till we meet again Apropos should Mazarin speak to you about me tell him that I should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether I am as he says too old for action	73.3676528930664
And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make DArtagnan shudder but DArtagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said	44.14212417602539
Go demon do what thou wilt It matters little now to me	47.78818130493164
There s no second Constance in the world	47.13108444213867
On his return to the cathedral DArtagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacristan	84.668701171875
Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures	3.918487548828125
DArtagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	140.06033325195312
DArtagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	39.7931022644043
In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one	185.62538146972656
Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame	1870.6717529296875
Then DArtagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the Rue de la Juiverie and enter in the Rue de la Calandre a respectable looking house and this DArtagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	37.6784782409668
Afraid of making any inquiries at this house DArtagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	63.7775764465332
This beverage required a good halfhour to prepare	18.266645431518555
And DArtagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsuspected	57.81174087524414
He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	76.56952667236328
He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving DArtagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	131.19374084472656
Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazins house	71.51215362548828
It was saddled and bridled	367.83843994140625
Almost immediately Bazin came downstairs	131.06361389160156
Look said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey	76.07838439941406
And where is he going asked DArtagnan	120.2401123046875
Forsooth I do nt know	974.1743774414062
Half a pistole if you can find out said DArtagnan	78.0640869140625
For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not difficult	110.25432586669922
You are not joking are you	334.55615234375
No on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	103.71654510498047
I shall ask him	216.8272247314453
Just the very way not to know	75.28141784667969
Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out	107.6952133178711
The halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket	34.285118103027344
I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de Paris	11.636656761169434
Well we must wait	120.66508483886719
They had not long to wait	2.000459671020508
Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip	186.5299835205078
Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent	32.027442932128906
Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	105.26056671142578
Well said DArtagnan	138.11679077148438
Well answered the boy the thing is done	189.6249237060547
Where is he gone	274.5749816894531
The halfpistole is for me	145.99891662597656
Doubtless answer me	493.55810546875
I want to see it	44.29838180541992
Give it me that I may see it is not false	77.97565460205078
There it is	73.87220764160156
The child put the piece of money into his pocket	61.333335876464844
And now where is he gone inquired DArtagnan	49.72837448120117
He is gone to Noisy	93.30902099609375
How dost thou know	127.43083190917969
Ah faith there was no great cunning necessary	57.44294738769531
I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to M	447.6194152832031
Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going	44.10044860839844
And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to Noisy	125.25466918945312
Tis his custom	83.92499542236328
He goes two or three times a week	115.50715637207031
Dost thou know Noisy well	48.25852966308594
I think so truly my nurse lives there	276.1631164550781
Is there a convent at Noisy	103.16632843017578
Is nt there a great and grand onethe convent of Jesuits	68.07238006591797
What is thy name	37.544158935546875
DArtagnan wrote the childs name in his tablets	1597.9017333984375
Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more halfpistoles in any way	258.9950256347656
Perhaps replied DArtagnan	101.46836853027344
And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne	189.26710510253906
Chapter VIII	86.81951141357422
DArtagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aramis	92.5205307006836
On entering the hotel DArtagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire	79.87554931640625
It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that DArtagnan himself could hardly recognize him	67.64948272705078
Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants	84.36290740966797
Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleines brother entered DArtagnans service	196.1461639404297
The plan adopted by DArtagnan was soon perfected	122.4030990600586
He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Meaux	82.42330169677734
He began his day by breakfasting substantiallya bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two oclock he had his two horses saddled and followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete	166.34425354003906
A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet	126.88005828857422
At about a league and a half from the city DArtagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time	99.70875549316406
The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition	6.281648635864258
A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him	80.81952667236328
DArtagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her winewhich was a horrible production from the country of Montreuiland heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville the other was a convent of Jesuits and was the propertya by no means unusual circumstanceof these worthy fathers	17.096052169799805
At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced his journey	23.903127670288086
He proceeded slowly and in deep reverie	230.7983856201172
Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	64.25692749023438
One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to DArtagnans deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longueville	155.02076721191406
That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	59.59522247314453
Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at court	109.76166534423828
She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Guise	85.2696304321289
She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the Prince de Marsillac the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Cond her brotherinlaw whom she now hated mortally	65.9342041015625
DArtagnan thought of all these matters	49156.5234375
He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longueville	361.71038818359375
He thought of Aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from illluck or from some natural defect or impediment remain halfway upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	101.53230285644531
He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said	117.84807586669922
I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same thing	667.5055541992188
I doubt it Planchet replied DArtagnan but what are you thinking of	103.20716094970703
I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested	20.62293815612793
Always cautious Planchet	32.89429473876953
Tis instinct your honor	356.24951171875
Well what does your instinct tell you now	442.485107421875
Sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in	47.11119842529297
Ah ah said DArtagnan Planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	77.6588134765625
One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his servant	235.45565795898438
Art thou sure said the man in the cloak	26.555858612060547
Yes my prince	175.93238830566406
My prince interrupted DArtagnan	106.51896667480469
Yes my prince but listen	153.21975708007812
If he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with him	121.07735443115234
What to do with him answered the prince	176.90518188476562
Yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend himself	231.97267150878906
Well we must try to take him alive	159.1187286376953
Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth	107.2914047241211
We have	36.15278625488281
Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman	135.13784790039062
Yes yes my lord do nt be uneasy	99.53080749511719
Besides I shall be there	153.55679321289062
You will assure us that justice	44.11574935913086
Yes yes I answer for all that the prince said	80.44829559326172
Well then well do our best	59.84722137451172
Having said that they went out of the stable	101.37271881103516
Well what matters all that to us said DArtagnan	144.77932739257812
This is one of those attempts that happen every day	75.68118286132812
Are you sure that we are not its objects	108.921875
We Why	89.32691955566406
Just remember what they said	91.65885925292969
I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me	160.89129638671875
He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you	116.63227844238281
What else	55.617767333984375
Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	42.263694763183594
Now then what do you say to that	68.737548828125
Alas my dear Planchet said DArtagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me	83.03101348876953
Those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no grudge	275.5643615722656
Is your honor sure	211.32835388183594
I can answer for it they do not	379.9172058105469
Well we wo nt speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in DArtagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed	103.09074401855469
They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to DArtagnan	45.92708206176758
Stop sir look yonder he whispered do nt you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses feet	45.692405700683594
Impossible returned DArtagnan	148.1524658203125
The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see something	71.05040740966797
At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space	55.0223274230957
There are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said DArtagnan let us ride onward	43.83932113647461
At about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village	7.449836254119873
The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses	38.99048614501953
Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores	12.894065856933594
These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village	165.9945831298828
Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limetrees	138.40074157714844
DArtagnan looked attentively at the building	290.4891052246094
This he said to Planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that	78.05913543701172
The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it well	244.3025360107422
Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits windows	31.63871192932129
In about five minutes Planchet returned	109.07337951660156
Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up	71.50990295410156
Hem If I were a Frondeur said DArtagnan I should knock here and should be sure of a good supper	112.9360122680664
If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst	31.435684204101562
Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Buridan	88.89092254638672
Shall I knock	338.2318115234375
Hush replied DArtagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window	113.35943603515625
Do you hear nothing whispered Planchet	46.75090408325195
What is that noise	41.129634857177734
There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded DArtagnan and Planchet	129.04348754882812
Heyday cried DArtagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack	78.16503143310547
Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on DArtagnan with naked swords	76.69829559326172
Do nt let him escape said a loud voice	59.348758697509766
No my lord be assured we shall not	203.6945037841797
DArtagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation	1438.67138671875
Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand	145.13023376464844
That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	125.80403137207031
Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice	37.83869552612305
Ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at Noisy Take care for I warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my swordand my sword is longI rip him up	81.98604583740234
The chieftain of the party drew near	47.5084228515625
What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command	309.2911071777344
And youwhat are you doing here replied DArtagnan	56.635440826416016
Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones rank	135.96771240234375
You do nt choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned DArtagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name	62.64163589477539
Enough enough what is your name	2.000459671020508
I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our Gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat	40.55696487426758
Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan	37.4642448425293
Lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur dArtagnan	177.20750427246094
I am	99.58667755126953
Then you came here to defend him	43.824302673339844
Him whom	54.81395721435547
The man we are seeking	163.22894287109375
It seems said DArtagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries	25.63315200805664
Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him	17.73348045349121
I am waiting for no one replied DArtagnan who was beginning to be angry	103.508544921875
I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you warning	54.767478942871094
Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us	55.351741790771484
Go away from here said DArtagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since I am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood	124.60540008544922
Eh monsieur said DArtagnan I beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king I will thrust it down your throat do you hear	422.67987060546875
Well well rejoined the leader there s no doubt tis a Gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	45.78840255737305
Our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	44.28857421875
We shall meet again Master dArtagnan continued the leader raising his voice	94.49313354492188
Yes but never with the same advantages said DArtagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight	373.3717346191406
Very good very good said the voice	92.67815399169922
En route gentlemen	42.5984001159668
And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to Paris	63.7755126953125
DArtagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords	607.2139892578125
Thou seest simpleton said DArtagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us	69.65730285644531
But to whom then	315.4910583496094
Ifaith I neither know nor care	45.64879608154297
What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their door	52.956016540527344
Happen what will the devil take them they ca nt eat us	29.190706253051758
And he mounted his horse	109.8186264038086
Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	156.6893310546875
Hey your honor cried Planchet I ve a man behind me	28.802507400512695
DArtagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchets horse	9.04849624633789
Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe	51.783687591552734
No no dear DArtagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left	11.940740585327148
And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by DArtagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream	136.27796936035156
Chapter IX	55.4276237487793
The Abb DHerblay	86.78805541992188
At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	67.42547607421875
Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	54.35090255737305
Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it	59.971683502197266
My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive you	98.84684753417969
Ah said DArtagnan is that the way you return to your apartment	66.9603500366211
After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very severe	39.08100509643555
Pardon me my dear friend said DArtagnan I think you said pardieu	32.749237060546875
Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is possible	44.76274871826172
You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to live	235.0808563232422
But will you not go up	85.34720611572266
Pass on before me I beg of you	57.658260345458984
As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire	98.0170669555664
And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	66.69175720214844
DArtagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed	24.537708282470703
I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good enough	114.29054260253906
Sir said Planchet when he saw DArtagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder	145.27459716796875
Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food	75.66934204101562
Marry forsooth people do nt die of hunger here	42.486087799072266
And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window	61.855567932128906
DArtagnan then looked around attentively	54.04097366333008
Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	135.53382873535156
At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Bordeaux	68.67943572998047
Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	102.37676239013672
The hangings were of damask the carpets from Alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine ladys couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification	43.03696823120117
You are examining my den said Aramis	163.1866912841797
Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartreux	76.54776763916016
But what are you looking for	151.5465850830078
I am looking for the person who let down the ladder	177.81517028808594
I see no one and yet the ladder did nt come down of itself	37.239051818847656
No it is Bazin	1873.17724609375
Ah ah said DArtagnan	129.7616424560547
But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly retired	33.92776107788086
Sit down my dear friend and let us talk	304.4057312011719
And Aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which DArtagnan stretched himself out	50.59420394897461
In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aramis	189.525390625
Yes if you really wish it said DArtagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite	63.81106948852539
Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected	49.111141204833984
Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur	67.46027374267578
Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit fathers	100.16608428955078
Bazin my friend come here	39.02954864501953
The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair	104.39347076416016
My dear Bazin said DArtagnan I am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church	50.025611877441406
Sir replied Bazin I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause	65.66001892089844
So far well said Aramis we are dying of hunger	46.16423416137695
Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine	77.85609436035156
Bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	184.3734588623047
Now we are alone dear Aramis said DArtagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchets horse	152.32513427734375
Ifaith answered Aramis as you see from Heaven	99.90229797363281
From Heaven replied DArtagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there	46.871192932128906
My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which DArtagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the same	44.96881103515625
Here then is a puzzle for the learned observed DArtagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise some place it on Mount Ararat others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	43.622467041015625
Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishops chateau	115.83826446533203
People do not go out from it by the door but by the window one does nt descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a limetree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the Prince de Marsillac	23.223007202148438
Aramis burst into a fit of laughter	68.25146484375
You were always a merry companion my dear DArtagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you	37.48720932006836
Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in love	51.59366989135742
A plague ont I shall not do so	15.023175239562988
After having been so long in love with Madame de Chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy	284.093505859375
Yes replied Aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess I once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us	115.75537872314453
Eventually she was obliged to leave France	110.78687286376953
He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister	60.19989013671875
He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waitingmaidpoor Kitty I have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I do nt know what village with I do nt know what cur of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her	72.47880554199219
For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as well	99.95338439941406
So they made this song about her Laboissiere dis moi	170.7836456298828
You know it do nt you	62.16515350341797
No sing it please	80.2009506225586
Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner	199.0446319580078
Bravo cried DArtagnan you sing charmingly dear Aramis	123.47357940673828
I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice	48.22535705566406
My dear DArtagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abb I say as few masses as I can	24.640531539916992
But to return to our duchess	107.44546508789062
Whichthe Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville	25.247167587280273
Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and that s all	46.233524322509766
No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the kings death	89.92021942138672
Yes she is still beautiful	88.42109680175781
Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that time	135.3339385986328
I gave her good advice by which she did not profit	61.488037109375
I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of Austria	33.8857307434082
She would nt believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb	91.11949157714844
After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevreuse	128.72605895996094
You know resumed DArtagnan that she has had leave to return to France	44.24997329711914
Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another	65.97615814208984
Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice	29.609180450439453
Oh this time returned Aramis I have nt seen her she is much changed	380.9444885253906
In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate	165.6696014404297
Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my appearance	138.35105895996094
Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirtyseven	132.33914184570312
Mind AramisDArtagnan smiled as he spokesince we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future	43.05159378051758
Formerly I was your junior by two or three years and if I am not mistaken I am turned forty years old	296.09661865234375
Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist	132.94595336914062
By your reckoning I must be fortythree at least	97.64140319824219
The devil I am Do nt let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abb	160.98216247558594
Do nt be afraid said DArtagnan	94.83529663085938
I never go there	105.61375427246094
Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst	38.60394287109375
Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	26.966201782226562
At last said Aramis we are ready are we	281.87969970703125
Yes monsieur quite ready said Bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the	118.42988586425781
Because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	37.846527099609375
But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it	21.882732391357422
Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	69.4759521484375
DArtagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abb dHerblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wideopen eyes at the face of his friend	201.95001220703125
Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that DArtagnan was quite overcome	191.10289001464844
But you expected some one then asked the officer	36.378421783447266
Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking me	12.574432373046875
From whom	57.89411163330078
From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers	259.7789611816406
Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	72.21348571777344
Come no hypocrisy you know that I do nt like it	18.339004516601562
You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands	156.07167053222656
Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	40.97380065917969
Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his shed	38.973087310791016
Now to supper said Aramis	184.34164428710938
The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	90.05452728271484
The deuce cried DArtagnan do you live in this way always	109.35616302490234
Yes pretty well	58.75463104248047
The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health then I have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with Lafolloneyou know the man I meanthe friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be Good Lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what I have eaten	42.8470573425293
Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said DArtagnan	81.5173568725586
What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of resignation	50.18299865722656
Every man that s born must fulfil his destiny	237.40048217773438
If it be not an indelicate question resumed DArtagnan have you grown rich	141.07809448242188
Oh Heaven no	317.65289306640625
I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me	115.55409240722656
And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems	270.61871337890625
No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my friend	52.085662841796875
What sermons Do you preach them	6326.54833984375
No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators	103.09688568115234
Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself	77.7023696899414
I should my dear DArtagnan have been so but nature said No	60.90962600708008
When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile too	64.64517211914062
Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise	48.06890106201172
An event took place in the Church of St	51.30819320678711
Louis au Marais	122.71095275878906
A gentleman laughed in my face	53.95756149291992
I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me	50.93423843383789
Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abblike all other abbs	60.57421875
And what was the end of the affair	131.91160583496094
We met in the Place RoyaleEgad you know about it	110.4981689453125
Was I not your second cried DArtagnan	300.50469970703125
You were you know how I settled the matter	30.13214874267578
Did he die	100.70169067382812
I do nt know	45.8686408996582
But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mortis	42.14316177368164
Tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul	7410.16748046875
Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered	69.76429748535156
Bazin my friend said Aramis you do nt seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation	53.0793342590332
You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw	37.998558044433594
Besides my friend DArtagnan has something to say to me privately have you not DArtagnan	178.78933715820312
DArtagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish wine	11.29278564453125
The two friends left alone remained silent face to face	150.19232177734375
Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion DArtagnan to be preparing his exordium	129.29237365722656
Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	289.62603759765625
It was Aramis who broke the silence	316.22650146484375
What are you thinking of DArtagnan he began	93.1517333984375
I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abb you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer	105.09681701660156
Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions	85.39646911621094
Since I became an abb I dream of nothing but battles	6.005021572113037
That is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	378.05889892578125
Do you still fence well	40.12791442871094
II fence as well as you did in the old timebetter still perhaps I do nothing else all day	278.77191162109375
And with whom	85.46751403808594
With an excellent masteratarms that we have here	268.25946044921875
What here	36.1817512512207
Yes here in this convent my dear fellow	16.077844619750977
There is everything in a Jesuit convent	73.54930877685547
Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men	53.36770248413086
Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being recognized	33.862205505371094
God pardon me said DArtagnan to himself I believe he has become more Gascon than I am Then aloud Well my dear Aramis do you ask me why I came to seek you	73.83463287353516
No I have not asked you that said Aramis with his subtle manner but I have expected you to tell me	59.527374267578125
Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he is	96.39007568359375
Hold on wait said Aramis that is an idea	3866.216796875
Of which I invite you to take advantage my friend	113.54493713378906
Let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich Answer frankly	61.18841552734375
I I am as poor as Job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes I do nt believe you would find a hundred pistoles	40.34402084350586
Peste a hundred pistoles said DArtagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as Job If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croesus	28.911197662353516
Then aloud Are you ambitious	41.83785629272461
As Enceladus	111.83940887451172
Well my friend I bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish	120.0457992553711
The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramiss face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape DArtagnans observation	11.058611869812012
Speak on said Aramis	45.3234748840332
One question first	114.75596618652344
Do you take any interest in politics	183.86749267578125
A gleam of light shone in Aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by DArtagnan	218.65673828125
No Aramis replied	108.16796875
Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God	53.537261962890625
It is possible	980.4718017578125
Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play	130.3564453125
Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time	106.49651336669922
Well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you who were the very soul of our society	419.3139953613281
Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment	37.20792007446289
To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easychair	52.530906677246094
Ah dear DArtagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am here	88.40582275390625
We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know	301.3219909667969
Tis true replied DArtagnan	187.99159240722656
Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude	173.34922790527344
In that case it would be quite another thing	270.970703125
Come lets be merciful to every sinner Besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present	237.0204315185547
How can you know that You who never interest yourself in politics	96.8324203491211
Ah without caring about them myself I live among those who are much occupied in them	107.9507827758789
Poet as I am I am intimate with Sarazin who is devoted to the Prince de Conti and with Monsieur de BoisRobert who since the death of Cardinal Richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me	147.0751953125
I have no doubt of it said DArtagnan	94.27001190185547
Now my dear friend look upon all I tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he hears	102.18815612792969
I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonderfor whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that Richelieu was great	50.230926513671875
I will not contradict you there said DArtagnan	132.90658569335938
My first impressions were favorable to the minister I said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved	78.33151245117188
DArtagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim	99.71055603027344
This then continued Aramis was my first opinion but as I am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others I have inquiredEhmy friend	27.636037826538086
Aramis paused	35.1895866394043
Well what asked his friend	13.21445083618164
Well I must mortify myself	41.65618133544922
I must confess that I was mistaken	31.52683448791504
Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	47.02415084838867
He is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in France	86.76368713378906
He will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others	36.39261245727539
He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon	51.2061767578125
Do you know him I do not	310.3928527832031
Hem said DArtagnan there is some truth in what you say	454.46075439453125
Ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed I am approved by a man like you fresh from the court	54.9118766784668
But you speak of him not of his party his resources	136.28050231933594
It is truethe queen is for him	100.66779327392578
Something in his favor	912.482421875
But he will never have the king	45.34999084472656
A mere child	202.55459594726562
A child who will be of age in four years	58.96785354614258
Then he has neither the parliament nor the people with himthey represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of France	15.295645713806152
DArtagnan scratched his ear	17.28452491760254
He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	72.51932525634766
You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Mazarin	86.3648681640625
I cried DArtagnan not in the least	75.65206146240234
You spoke of a mission	76.67522430419922
Did I I was wrong then no I said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	150.455322265625
Well lets fly the feather before the wind let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life	33.25061798095703
We were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes	78.63911437988281
Heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond	470.33837890625
You are right DArtagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me	40.0090217590332
Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out	139.521484375
Monsieur de Gondy the cardinals enemy	48.61626434326172
No the kings friend said Aramis the kings friend you understand	186.18528747558594
Well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans duty	53.454280853271484
But the king is with Mazarin	116.88521575927734
He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor child	158.06304931640625
Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aramis	23.182878494262695
War for the king	41.51889419555664
Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarins side	33.574310302734375
But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beaufort	1026.4552001953125
Monsieur de Beaufort He is at Vincennes	59.11103820800781
Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort Monsieur de Beaufort or another	86.86125183105469
Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince	32.224056243896484
But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal	35.754364013671875
Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	1346.0245361328125
And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy	34.17167663574219
But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him	153.7137908935547
And are there no cardinals that can fight Come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de Gassion	42.4272575378418
But a humpbacked general	129.78404235839844
Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	60.42006301879883
Besides remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye	45.65448760986328
Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked DArtagnan	198.6610870361328
I foresee in it the aid of powerful princes	13.805216789245605
With the enmity of the government	1773.60107421875
Counteracted by parliament and insurrections	67.52640533447266
That may be done if they can separate the king from his mother	41.61941146850586
That may be done said Aramis	61.63478088378906
Never cried DArtagnan	231.68182373046875
You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I do	69.9615478515625
Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than I do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon Mazarin	44.50352478027344
Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge myself	42.64982223510742
To them or to us do you mean Aramis	37.948944091796875
To no one	33.618438720703125
I am a priest resumed Aramis	35.861351013183594
What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any breviary	261.29376220703125
I have a jolly little circle of witty abbs and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in politics	60.3863639831543
Well listen my dear Aramis said DArtagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor	407.03326416015625
I do nt know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious	80.811279296875
I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Trville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gascon	128.2876739501953
Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his estate	55.76924514770508
You know he has estatesPorthos	181.02032470703125
I should think so indeed	45.57221603393555
Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon	106.08492279052734
Good said DArtagnan to himself	263.6271667480469
That s what I wanted to know	29.068971633911133
Porthos is in Picardy	16.301013946533203
Then aloud	23.631717681884766
And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon	35.94013214111328
To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth	38.805118560791016
So that Porthos will be a baron	80.64390563964844
I do nt doubt it	29.69621467590332
The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly charming	112.85338592529297
And the two friends began to laugh	36.761268615722656
So DArtagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarins	207.37741088867188
Nor you of the Prince de Cond	85.28329467773438
No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists	102.2788314819336
Adieu then	83.38505554199219
And DArtagnan poured out a glass of wine	70.51913452148438
To old times he said	65.37918853759766
Yes returned Aramis	453.0958251953125
Unhappily those times are past	136.05462646484375
Nonsense They will return said DArtagnan	49.196807861328125
At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette	298.2868957519531
And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door	419.77508544921875
From eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window	73.85541534423828
Adieu dear friend	317.8692321777344
Oh I ca nt let you go so I will go with you	134.89468383789062
And he took his sword and cloak	26.651411056518555
He wants to be sure that I go away said DArtagnan to himself	117.83139038085938
Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the antechamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him	10.790081977844238
Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	135.49407958984375
Come come sleepy head quick the ladder	76.32594299316406
But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window	81.71856689453125
The other one the gardeners	64.00408935546875
Did nt you see that Monsieur dArtagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to descend	152.92189025878906
DArtagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	73.36457061767578
Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	132.674072265625
Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	69.96341705322266
Now then said DArtagnan this is something like this is a means of communication	105.09896850585938
A woman could go up a ladder like that	313.0326232910156
Aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but DArtagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	45.53863525390625
Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent	60.90323257446289
In a moment he was on the ground	307.09765625
Bazin remained at the window	216.46864318847656
Stay there said Aramis I shall return immediately	45.853763580322266
The two friends went toward the shed	552.6107788085938
At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses	291.364013671875
That is good to see said Aramis	205.58421325683594
There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	59.64972686767578
Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village	10.790081977844238
They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses	48.39716720581055
Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own career	557.5698852539062
Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace	74.48355865478516
As for me I remain in my humility and indolence	177.81626892089844
Thus tis quite decided said DArtagnan that what I have to offer to you does not tempt you	78.48787689208984
On the contrary it would tempt me were I any other man rejoined Aramis but I repeat I am made up of contradictions	2.000459671020508
What I hate today I adore tomorrow and vice versa	27.598651885986328
You see that I can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan	52.57014846801758
Thou liest subtile one said DArtagnan to himself	67.37517547607422
Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily	181.1309356689453
The friends embraced	125.13563537597656
They descended into the plain by the ladder	97.68457794189453
Planchet met them hard by the shed	128.52745056152344
DArtagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands	26.67643928527832
DArtagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris	92.63516998291016
But after he had gone about two hundred steps DArtagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his girdle	95.67681884765625
What s the matter asked Planchet	71.21359252929688
This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his dupe	65.83724975585938
Stand here do nt stir turn your back to the road and wait for me	48.58343505859375
Having thus spoken DArtagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	88.55982971191406
He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge	171.70718383789062
The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	126.33226013183594
He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone	38.73640060424805
In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers	167.41555786132812
Close to the hedge the steps stopped	46.05978012084961
DArtagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge	84.37327575683594
Two men to the astonishment of DArtagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier	95.00701904296875
Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen again	265.92449951171875
I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet	178.6879119873047
Oh answered another voice which DArtagnan instantly recognized as that of Aramis	51.14329528808594
I swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized	105.88050079345703
Yes yes I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party	136.78688049316406
Be prudent sensible	73.11695861816406
I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a voice	197.76449584960938
He kissed her hand tenderly	93.54798889160156
Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	107.56951904296875
What s the matter asked Aramis	66.37178039550781
Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat	91.97596740722656
Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat	52.297096252441406
DArtagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier	94.05085754394531
At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like DArtagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light DArtagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longueville	73.79971313476562
Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	73.22711944580078
Good said DArtagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have theethou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville	108.03523254394531
Chapter X	30.085229873657227
Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	1050.31640625
Thanks to what Aramis had told him DArtagnan who knew already that Porthos called himself Du Vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate De Bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon	262.5273742675781
It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate	163.43939208984375
His itinerary was promptly determined he would go to Dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward Soissons the other toward Compiegne there he would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained	86.76993560791016
Planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow DArtagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself	105.68907165527344
DArtagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he Planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	55.82975387573242
This reasoning seemed to DArtagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight oclock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the Hotel de la Chevrette and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of the Saint Denis gate	75.70330047607422
At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiriesthe host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to bed	275.0947265625
The next morning DArtagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer	37.96246337890625
DArtagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey	104.2821273803711
At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	253.65570068359375
His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he needed	170.8242950439453
The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from VillarsCotterets	119.22785949707031
DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time VillarsCotterets was a royal residence	84.01885223388672
He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin dOr	47.526641845703125
There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracieux	83.94685363769531
Porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added that name to his others	87.10995483398438
He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new estate	58.870391845703125
The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	350.48760986328125
It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	328.5090026855469
There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	99.15255737304688
Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	44.55384826660156
It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by DArtagnan	128.448974609375
It was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	182.6322021484375
Their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right	163.3867950439453
The morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze	209.62799072265625
In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	42.92445373535156
There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart	38.23515701293945
DArtagnan sick of the closeness of Paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying If I were Porthos and DArtagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to him I know what I should say to it	213.12144470214844
As to Planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound in his old masters company	39.72537612915039
At the extremity of the wood DArtagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	140.21322631835938
Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of Orleans	190.3450469970703
Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de Longueville	82.92276000976562
Faith exclaimed Planchet heres land in good condition if it belongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy	101.5329360961914
Zounds cried DArtagnan do nt call him Porthos nor even Vallon call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise	677.5288696289062
As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye DArtagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken	241.79335021972656
One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet	51.629661560058594
On arriving at the extremity of the castle DArtagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of Henry IV	157.7145538330078
and surmounted by four stately gilded weathercocks	24.25150489807129
DArtagnan no longer doubted that this was Porthoss pleasant dwelling place	164.3035430908203
The road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc dEnghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles VII	2.000459671020508
DArtagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by Planchet at the same pace	93.05211639404297
In ten minutes DArtagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	45.71685791015625
In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse	87.45052337646484
On his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced	16.47768783569336
A considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	165.5465545654297
Ah said DArtagnan to himself can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Welladay how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of Porthos	57.11530303955078
This can not be Monsieur Porthos observed Planchet replying as it were to his masters thoughts	73.38175201416016
Monsieur Porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five	89.53446197509766
Nevertheless said DArtagnan the people are bowing very low to this person	83.79419708251953
As he spoke he rode toward the tall horseto the man of importance and his valets	306.7525329589844
As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual	51.42887878417969
Jesu cried Planchet can it be	155.1392364501953
At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile ofMousqueton	64.47806549072266
It was indeed MousquetonMousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing DArtagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary	69.85574340820312
Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur dArtagnan cried Mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy Monsieur dArtagnan oh what joy for my lord and master Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	110.7389144897461
Thou good Mousqueton where is thy master	452.1347351074219
You stand upon his property	77.37905883789062
But how handsome thou arthow fat thou hast prospered and grown stout and DArtagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one	130.7896728515625
Hey yes thank God I am pretty well said Mousqueton	66.28154754638672
But hast thou nothing to say to thy friend Planchet	82.11041259765625
How my friend Planchet Planchetart thou there cried Mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears	137.99533081054688
My very self replied Planchet but I wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud	121.94007873535156
Proud toward an old friend never Planchet thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well	36.27483367919922
So far so well answered Planchet alighting and extending his arms to Mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of Mousqueton	16.018695831298828
And now sir resumed Mousqueton when he had rid himself of Planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friends fat back now sir allow me to leave you for I could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you	124.57414245605469
This dear friend said DArtagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by Porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me	76.61032104492188
Forgottenhe cried Mousqueton there s not a day sir that we do nt expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of Monsieur de Gassion or of Monsieur de Bassompierre	115.83306121826172
On DArtagnans lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soulthe last trace of youth and happiness that had survived lifes disillusions	403.30859375
And youfellows resumed Mousqueton stay near Monsieur le Comte dArtagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to prepare my lord for his visit	63.01371765136719
And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop	52.425697326660156
Ah there there s something promising said DArtagnan	147.46141052246094
No mysteries no cloak to hide ones self in no cunning policy here people laugh outright they weep for joy here	66.82870483398438
I see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days	123.91825103759766
As for me said Planchet I seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	107.93004608154297
Ah sir what a cook must Monsieur Pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos	2.1138858795166016
Say no more cried DArtagnan	180.07830810546875
If the reality corresponds with appearances I am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and I shall fail with him as I have already done with Aramis	40.015167236328125
Chapter XI	116.08973693847656
Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness	249.80508422851562
DArtagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau	57.80016326904297
He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	109.77596282958984
Let us do justice to DArtagnan	299.4356384277344
Independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man	939.2564086914062
He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity	210.00608825683594
Mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	377.0245056152344
Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	51.65603256225586
Ah how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me	69.85311126708984
Forget you oh dear Du Vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth ones dearest friends the dangers we have dared together On the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory	65.20639038085938
Yes yes said Porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	2479.5634765625
Yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel	103.44987487792969
And he heaved a sigh	211.76483154296875
Under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits tomorrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent	29.534120559692383
I have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around	377.8157958984375
And Porthos heaved another sigh	34.06776428222656
But first interposed DArtagnan you must present me to Madame du Vallon	117.44876861572266
A third sigh from Porthos	84.64859008789062
I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account	302.26934814453125
That was the reason why I left my Chateau du Vallon near Corbeil and came to my estate Bracieux	55.66672134399414
Poor Madame du Vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes	30.60350227355957
So you are free now and rich	166.29928588867188
Alas groaned Porthos I am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year	114.44225311279297
Let us go to breakfast	80.8841781616211
I shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry	161.8848876953125
Yes said Porthos my air is excellent	129.61798095703125
They went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt	47.4681396484375
A table ready set out awaited them	230.424072265625
You see said Porthos this is my usual style	75.4393081665039
Devil take me answered DArtagnan I wish you joy of it	109.31221771240234
The king has nothing like it	54.737091064453125
No answered Porthos I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal Monsieur de Mazarin	162.39244079589844
Taste this cutlet my dear DArtagnan tis off one of my sheep	88.11951446533203
You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it	41.51449966430664
said DArtagnan	96.38593292236328
Yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture	1150.3433837890625
Give me another cutlet	58.14234924316406
No try this hare which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens	51.01580810546875
Zounds what a flavor cried DArtagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your hares	34.03638458251953
And how do you like my wine asked Porthos it is pleasant is nt it	100.78897857666016
It is nothing however but a wine of the country	152.0650177001953
Yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads	39.023075103759766
Quite a vineyard hey	149.7186737060547
Porthos sighed for the fifth timeDArtagnan had counted his sighs	46.51145935058594
He became curious to solve the problem	393.9520568847656
Well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps That health which	21.440126419067383
Excellent my dear friend better than ever	253.19552612304688
I could kill an ox with a blow of my fist	143.9169464111328
Well then family affairs perhaps	65.33521270751953
Family I have happily only myself in the world to care for	114.4041748046875
But what makes you sigh	176.22911071777344
My dear fellow replied Porthos to be candid with you I am not happy	53.09941101074219
You are not happy Porthos You who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who have forty thousand francs a yearyouarenothappy	115.61311340332031
My dear friend all those things I have but I am a hermit in the midst of superfluity	169.98216247558594
Surrounded I suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate	2.9005866050720215
Porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	77.68843841552734
No but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as Charlemagne or at least to Hugh Capet	113.10787963867188
When I first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances	150.06103515625
I made them but you know my dear friend Madame du Vallon	68.73686218261719
Porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	35.67216110229492
Madame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility	57.59890365600586
She had in her first marriageI do nt think DArtagnan I am telling you anything newmarried a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men	53.25282669067383
I have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend	38.16630172729492
So that I have no society I live alone I am sick of itmy mind preys on itself	23.432302474975586
DArtagnan smiled	42.65699005126953
He now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	81.30078125
But now he said that you are a widower your wifes connection can not injure you	98.27967071533203
Yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the De Courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the Rohans who did nt wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and I can say nothing to them	56.11442184448242
Ah If I only were a	1355.0428466796875
A baron do nt you mean cried DArtagnan finishing his friends sentence	84.44786834716797
Ah cried Porthos would I were but a baron	35.45111083984375
Well my friend I am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much	23.649364471435547
Porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken	119.7859115600586
Mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	9.028117179870605
Porthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles	113.89704132080078
I am glad to see said DArtagnan that you have still that honest lad with you	163.53402709960938
He is my steward replied Porthos he will never leave me	42.701786041259766
Go away now Mouston	125.5000228881836
So he s called Mouston thought DArtagnan tis too long a word to pronounce Mousqueton	53.86958694458008
Well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	291.92974853515625
You can suppose Porthos that what I have to say relates to most important matters	30.615398406982422
Devil take them let us walk in the park answered Porthos for the sake of digestion	123.493896484375
Egad said DArtagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing	134.78819274902344
My friend replied Porthos I leave fishing to Mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut I shoot sometimes that is to say when I am dull and I sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and I shoot rabbits	58.163734436035156
Really how very amusing	57.90457534790039
Yes replied Porthos with a sigh it is amusing	81.38309478759766
DArtagnan now no longer counted the sighs	153.9217987060547
They were innumerable	86.41571044921875
However what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject	163.0554656982422
With pleasure replied DArtagnan I must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life	90.21269226074219
Go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside	18.64910125732422
Ah hang it said Porthos	120.05667114257812
I see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinals guards have so many proofs	67.46724700927734
Ah my fist is strong enough I swear cried Porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton	70.95191955566406
So much the better	212.0865936279297
Are we then to go to war	46.656768798828125
By my troth yes	13.39771556854248
Against whom	46.15614318847656
Are you a politician friend	210.9049530029297
Not in the least	198.76597595214844
Are you for Mazarin or for the princes	107.7057876586914
I am for no one	24.769872665405273
That is to say you are for us	53.4240608215332
Well I tell you that I come to you from the cardinal	77.87711334228516
This speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal	22.94313621520996
Ho ho What are the wishes of his eminence	29.725276947021484
He wishes to have you in his service	62.36383819580078
And who spoke to him of me	495.051025390625
Rochefortyou remember him	21.695653915405273
Yes pardieu It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three swordwounds in three separate engagements	24.115697860717773
But you know he is now our friend	31.473834991455078
No I did nt know that	18.200597763061523
So he cherishes no resentment	6.491919994354248
You are mistaken Porthos said DArtagnan	47.310401916503906
It is I who cherish no resentment	32.657100677490234
Porthos did nt understand any too clearly but then we know that understanding was not his strong point	161.00711059570312
You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal	93.86425018310547
Yes and the queen too	24.759403228759766
The queen do you say	87.40437316894531
To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which I do nt know how she has regained possession	66.29646301269531
But it seems to me said Porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you	66.49535369873047
So I think replied DArtagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them	121.8481216430664
Yes we are devoted to them repeated Porthos and youto whom are you devoted now	4823.59423828125
To the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover I have answered for your devotion also	172.77767944335938
And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf	55.84772491455078
Magnificent my dear fellow magnificent In the first place you have plenty of money have nt you forty thousand francs income I think you said	95.45411682128906
Porthos began to be suspicious	273.2022399902344
Eh my friend said he one never has too much money	101.61013793945312
Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder I am not much of a hand at figures so that I live almost from hand to mouth	457.54925537109375
He is afraid I have come to borrow money thought DArtagnan	639.8731079101562
Ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties	5.072192668914795
How is it all the better	71.91343688964844
Yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles	60.61591720581055
Ah ah ah said Porthos opening his eyes at that last word	164.64337158203125
Under the other cardinal continued DArtagnan we did nt know enough to make our profits this however does nt concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me	121.06887817382812
Porthos sighed	180.43612670898438
At the same time continued DArtagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey	95.91402435302734
Yes indeed said Porthos	228.60037231445312
Well my dear friend win itit is at the point of your sword	114.83769989013672
We shall not interfere with each otheryour object is a title mine money	102.63101959228516
If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the Crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all I wish	102.5229721069336
I shall retire and die tranquillyat home	94.94198608398438
For my part said Porthos I desire to be made a baron	139.2704315185547
You shall be one	9491.94140625
And have you not seen any of our other friends	181.55880737304688
Yes I have seen Aramis	48.503902435302734
And what does he wish To be a bishop	52.06932067871094
Aramis answered DArtagnan who did not wish to undeceive Porthos Aramis fancy has become a monk and a Jesuit and lives like a bear	281.44146728515625
My offers did not arouse himdid not even tempt him	2.000459671020508
So much the worse He was a clever man	79.02997589111328
And Athos	144.6293182373047
I have not yet seen him	34.874332427978516
Do you know where I shall find him	55.69624328613281
Near Blois	154.63516235351562
He is called Bragelonne	59.820255279541016
Only imagine my dear friend	398.4422912597656
Athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignitiesthe Comte de la Fere Comte de Bragelonne	84.24539947509766
And he has no children with all these titles	32.01092529296875
Ah said Porthos I have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly	19.972686767578125
What Athos Our Athos who was as virtuous as Scipio Have you seen him	103.46379089355469
Well I shall see him tomorrow and tell him about you but I m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him	144.85873413085938
Yes he used to drink a great deal replied Porthos	91.04452514648438
And then he was older than any of us added DArtagnan	68.55967712402344
Some years only	94.26461029052734
His gravity made him look older than he was	70.4303207397461
Well then if we can get Athos all will be well	121.75548553466797
If we can not we will do without him	57.4576301574707
We two are worth a dozen	54.950592041015625
Yes said Porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirtysix more especially as you say the work will not be childs play	112.51718139648438
Will it last long	159.40753173828125
Byr Lady two or three years perhaps	130.05209350585938
So much the better cried Porthos	59.684776306152344
You have no idea my friend how my bones ache since I came here	55.96798324584961
Sometimes on a Sunday I take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which I am really in want of but nothing happens	62.27937698364258
Either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and I come back still more weary and lowspirited that s all	151.3733367919922
At any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in Paris is there not	56.042972564697266
In that respect my dear friend its delightful	79.37138366699219
No more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more De Jussacs nor other bloodhounds	12.135808944702148
IGad underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask Are you one of the Fronde They unsheathe and that s all that is said	200.98126220703125
The Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing was said of it	86.225830078125
Ah things go on gaily then said Porthos	102.50566864013672
Besides which in a short time resumed DArtagnan We shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety	54.642215728759766
Well then I decide	124.27879333496094
I have your word then	249.5109100341797
Yes tis given	84.05427551269531
I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but	234.32284545898438
But he must make me a baron	112.30347442626953
Zounds said DArtagnan that s settled already I will be responsible for the barony	109.60977935791016
On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the castle	48.507991790771484
Chapter XII	79.44400787353516
Porthos was Discontented with his Condition	40.377479553222656
As they returned toward the castle DArtagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not	291.65399169921875
In the position of Porthos DArtagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make Porthos contented there was wantingwhat five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage	54.43268966674805
I shall pass all my life thought DArtagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot	39.17103576660156
Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct	245.83607482910156
When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton approaching	91.86511993408203
The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	87.93473815917969
Here is what I am looking for thought DArtagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am here	22.849454879760742
He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him	151.12940979003906
Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask you	41.634254455566406
Speak out my friend	168.2824249267578
I am afraid to do so	267.9430847167969
Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me	47.59423828125
Art thou happy friend asked DArtagnan	301.7478942871094
As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I am	52.3739128112793
Well speak if it depends on me	122.21978759765625
Oh sir it depends on you only	53.64292907714844
I listenI am waiting to hear	53.86881637573242
Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but Mouston	395.00372314453125
Since I have had the honor of being my lords steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me	1144.4410400390625
You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants	4790.93359375
DArtagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his short	2373.05322265625
Well my dear Mouston he said rest satisfied	40.1962890625
I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any longer	142.26278686523438
Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask	204.81387329101562
Alas thought DArtagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me	91.73760223388672
Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance	416.8865051269531
I go tomorrow my friend replied DArtagnan	341.5194396972656
Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets	163.37814331054688
I fear that is true said DArtagnan in a low tone	273.78271484375
DArtagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing Porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for Porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor Mousqueton whose only wish was to be called Moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	97.36872100830078
He was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner	229.89869689941406
What to dinner said DArtagnan	371.43280029296875
What time is it then	458.29864501953125
Eh why it is after one oclock	95.48822021484375
Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of time	1083.93408203125
I follow you though I am not hungry	277.2232360839844
Come if one ca nt always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be lonely	50.267215728759766
DArtagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host	281.41717529296875
Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to DArtagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served	122.8263931274414
Therefore when at dessert upon a sign from DArtagnan Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone	165.0006561279297
Porthos said DArtagnan who will attend you in your campaigns	90.58045196533203
Why replied Porthos Mouston of course	396.4786071777344
This was a blow to DArtagnan	87.87651062011719
He could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grief	279.0513610839844
But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service	148.0101776123047
That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he would nt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much	1906.63427734375
Oh blind selflove thought DArtagnan	70.22796630859375
And you asked Porthos have nt you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name	477.81597900390625
Planchetyes I have found him again but he is lackey no longer	55.21416473388672
What is he then	391.507080078125
With his sixteen hundred francsyou remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of La Rochelle by carrying a letter to Lord de Winterhe has set up a little shop in the Rue des Lombards and is now a confectioner	77.81163787841797
Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards How does it happen then that he is in your service	129.2974853515625
He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed	120.53880310058594
And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchets adventure	42.91703414916992
Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it	57.98768997192383
I should not have believed him but men are changed by events	78.10515594482422
There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine	73.23255920410156
Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much of	56.220054626464844
At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed	151.69386291503906
Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition	24.588037490844727
Your arms my lordwhat arms	84.41927337646484
Zounds my weapons	96.3621826171875
What weapons	41.62602615356445
My military weapons	2.000459671020508
Yes my lord at any rate I think so	76.79340362548828
Make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	146.79261779785156
Which is my best cavalry horse	56.852169036865234
And the best hack	92.89849853515625
What horse dost thou choose for thyself	64.33053588867188
I like Rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me	95.1842269897461
Strong thinkest thou	40.89103317260742
Half Norman half Mecklenburger will go night and day	71.08382415771484
That will do for us	130.31698608398438
See to these horses	126.900390625
Polish up or make some one else polish my arms	129.3018035888672
Then take pistols with thee and a huntingknife	121.40961456298828
Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather uneasy	58.22697067260742
Something better still Mouston	136.20184326171875
An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies	295.8606262207031
We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost	52.24413299560547
Into the servicethe kings service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at DArtagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked	48.15215301513672
Yes and no	71.0031967163086
We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former life	268.8995666503906
These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt	115.12109375
It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	200.40602111816406
The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air	121.36336517333984
The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to DArtagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to Porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	78.81990814208984
Mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by DArtagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon which was near Corbeil or Bracieux which was near Melun and of Pierrefonds which was between Compiegne and VillarsCotterets	32.72480773925781
Butformerlyit appears began Mousqueton timidly	145.15716552734375
Oh said DArtagnan we do nt now make war as we did formerly	22.851247787475586
Today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planchet	116.40919494628906
Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of DArtagnan	101.52674102783203
But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung	49.13899230957031
The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then	86.4144287109375
Porthos meantime asked DArtagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey	147.82363891601562
Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to Paris	322.05999755859375
Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await me	45.86587905883789
That s agreed said Porthos	71.66019439697266
As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I do nt think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said DArtagnan	110.46529388427734
The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his friend	221.43885803222656
At least DArtagnan said to himself as he took the road to VillarsCotterets at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking	211.87109375
That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck	11.864908218383789
At VillarsCotterets he wrote to the cardinal	31.995546340942383
My LordI have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men	87.96556091308594
I am just setting out for Blois	105.84945678710938
The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that city	2668.53662109375
Chapter XIII	108.01030731201172
Two Angelic Faces	73.4522933959961
The road was long but the horses upon which DArtagnan and Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of Bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for DArtagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant	25.692487716674805
He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	59.550880432128906
It was many years since DArtagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly	351.3683166503906
Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense	260.5885009765625
Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that DArtagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Blois	96.9460220336914
Going along DArtagnan shaking his head said	27.80405616760254
I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters	33.11058807373047
Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain	75.95953369140625
Do you remember sir that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des Carmes Ah how lofty how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day when he said to his adversary You have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since I shall be obliged to kill you	51.54265594482422
I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentlemanMonsieur Athos	199.0344696044922
Yes true as Gospel said DArtagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities	37.40732192993164
I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men drink	262.8767395019531
One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows	63.446617126464844
And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for that	82.05988311767578
And now replied DArtagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	53.36545181274414
This noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command Alas we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us	42.46523666381836
God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so much	52.749046325683594
Planchet shook his head and said nothing	21.67679214477539
It was evident that he shared his masters apprehensions	92.23825073242188
And then resumed DArtagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel Grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay Planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it	132.31529235839844
I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him stammering said Planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for I imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of Blois	62.38733673095703
Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chambord	37.93107223510742
At this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the Loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	60.880470275878906
A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	55.75263214111328
Ho friend cried Planchet	687.8477172851562
What s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de lUniversite	35.223289489746094
We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagnan	123.96990966796875
The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	75.3831787109375
Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chateau	79.18131256103516
DArtagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planchet	111.10020446777344
The chateau he said to himself what chateau Ah I understand Athos is not a man to be thwarted he like Porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau	246.7383575439453
He had a heavy handdear old Athosafter drinking	157.698974609375
DArtagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman	358.5833740234375
He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought	302.390869140625
Soon as the road turned the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	31.202011108398438
On beholding this house DArtagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	308.1044006347656
He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period	51.547672271728516
Through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country	214.87728881835938
We are mistaken said DArtagnan	38.857574462890625
This can not be the establishment of Athos	104.0412826538086
Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name	573.6548461914062
Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to do	73.91727447509766
Planchet alighted	62.0153694152832
Thou must add said DArtagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name	46.967620849609375
Planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	141.36456298828125
Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planchet	22.15843963623047
Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in livery	44.55644989013672
A nobleman retired from service is he not	150.567138671875
And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he could nt have too much information	57.90625762939453
Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to foot	206.13726806640625
Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we seek	11.876045227050781
Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him	150.48538208007812
Why did nt you say so said the servitor opening the gate	20.788480758666992
But where is your master	255.1266326904297
He is following me	66.42332458496094
The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to DArtagnan	160.84512329101562
The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting	56.514068603515625
Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say	37.12855529785156
Well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here	74.486572265625
This voice the sound of which reached DArtagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten	118.1977310180664
He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	9.012611389160156
But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the threshold	95.45015716552734
Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know you	51.02326583862305
I am PlanchetPlanchet whom you know well	19.360536575317383
But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview	49.333492279052734
What Planchet is Monsieur dArtagnan here	44.4625358581543
Here I am my friend dear Athos cried DArtagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation	1175.6021728515625
At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Athos	142.35472106933594
He rushed toward DArtagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms	2.000459671020508
DArtagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes	71.60517120361328
Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several people	99.38473510742188
Every one arose	86.96829986572266
I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier DArtagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever known	74.7791748046875
DArtagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Athos	253.94517517089844
Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever	25.035663604736328
His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	47.4681396484375
His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck	157.84371948242188
He was less stiff than formerly	95.8653335571289
His long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a Hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	133.35922241210938
Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment	72.41323852539062
Ah tis Raoul who is come home	81.74542236328125
Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at DArtagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face	40.31406021118164
But DArtagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers	108.99861907958984
Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage	69.54863739013672
It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence	79.99516296386719
He remained listening and gazing	70.97042846679688
Here you are home again Raoul said the comte	27.734586715698242
Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave me	73.4734878540039
But what s the matter Raoul said Athos very anxiously	177.12261962890625
You are pale and agitated	188.95501708984375
Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor	47.4681396484375
To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos quickly	111.01738739013672
What is it cried many persons present	196.70571899414062
She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I stopped	201.457275390625
She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again	139.19866943359375
I fear that she has badly sprained her ankle	81.64884948730469
Oh heavens cried Athos	25.22373390197754
And her mother Madame de SaintRemy have they yet told her of it	173.12339782714844
No sir Madame de SaintRemy is at Blois with the Duchess of Orleans	59.506996154785156
I am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	71.84841918945312
I am come sir to ask your advice	51.050899505615234
Send directly to Blois Raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself	54.862831115722656
Raoul bowed	67.8691635131836
But where is Louise asked the comte	4548.076171875
I have brought her here sir and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold wellwater	62.506412506103516
The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage	67.29092407226562
You are right sir said Athos	37.50775146484375
She will be the sooner with her mother	95.64096069335938
As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly	125.88787078857422
No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is not	136.8465118408203
Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster	479.67877197265625
Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de SaintRemy	122.8263931274414
The youth looked pleased	167.39273071289062
He again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a firstrate esquire after bowing to Athos and DArtagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted	260.8867492675781
Chapter XIV	157.60897827148438
The Castle of Bragelonne	49.84627151489258
Whilst this scene was going on DArtagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze	573.0547485351562
Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	298.4739685058594
Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	85.53319549560547
Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up	461.41851806640625
True monsieur le comte replied DArtagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	19.7271728515625
Athos smiled	44.441104888916016
First and foremost dear DArtagnan we have no title such as count here	93.76887512207031
When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are	71.56663513183594
But to you DArtagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your friend	145.17127990722656
Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were	115.16365051269531
Oh God forbid	41.135353088378906
Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other	1225.683837890625
You are surprised at what you see here	157.74508666992188
But above all things I am a marvel to you	9490.564453125
I confess it	34.39554977416992
I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age	28.563262939453125
On the contrary I do not find you the same person at all	237.160400390625
I understand cried Athos with a gentle blush	272.8382568359375
Everything DArtagnan even folly has its limit	30.575613021850586
Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own I presume You have a park and horses servants	94.45538330078125
Athos smiled	11.6398344039917
Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told you	105.57009887695312
The park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a common	48.02666091918945
I have two horsesI do not count my servants bobtailed nag	213.11849975585938
My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters	81.59708404541016
But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos laughing	56.24971008300781
Yes I see for the young man Raoul said DArtagnan	55.13917922973633
You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest	249.19570922851562
I have brought him up	8.093596458435059
It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life	44.78535079956055
This child has caused me to recover what I had lost	210.64865112304688
I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for him	403.9968566894531
I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had not	164.0308074951172
Precept something but example more	24.115697860717773
I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display	44.12079620361328
The remembrance of Milady recurred to DArtagnan	41.88584518432617
And you are happy he said to his friend	27.35793685913086
As happy as it is allowed to one of Gods creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think DArtagnan for you have not yet done so	68.29147338867188
You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered DArtagnan	143.1204376220703
I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling	40.25339889526367
Remorse I finish your phrase	22.984432220458984
Yes and no	112.91496276855469
I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her punishment	170.94187927246094
Had she one redeeming trait I doubt it	82.33526611328125
I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction	138.8581085205078
But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	48.830074310302734
Perhaps all blood demands some expiation	60.96352767944336
Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours	28.32029151916504
I have sometimes thought as you do Athos	33.20203399658203
She had a son that unhappy woman	37.284767150878906
Have you ever heard of him	48.163150787353516
He must be about twentythree years of age said Athos in a low tone	43.64772415161133
I often think of that young man DArtagnan	227.68809509277344
Strange for I had forgotten him said the lieutenant	217.73056030273438
Athos smiled the smile was melancholy	29.89177703857422
And Lord de Winterdo you know anything about him	198.18014526367188
I know that he is in high favor with Charles I	131.7848663330078
The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water	153.4882049560547
He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just nowblood will have blood	108.99825286865234
And the queen	106.23860931396484
What queen	288.56500244140625
Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry IV	116.19525146484375
She is at the Louvre as you know	78.35486602783203
Yes and I hear in bitter poverty	249.19961547851562
Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed	134.926513671875
Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry IV	349.66717529296875
shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted nothing	188.53184509277344
Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired DArtagnan	38.21413803100586
No but my mother as a child saw her	74.62849426269531
Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici	273.46160888671875
You know Athos you never spoke much of such matters	36.601444244384766
Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for speaking	119.38737487792969
Porthos would nt have waited for it so patiently said DArtagnan with a smile	133.68138122558594
Every one according to his nature my dear DArtagnan	137.21759033203125
Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	147.45057678222656
Have you seen him	16.146696090698242
I left him five days ago said DArtagnan and he portrayed with Gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of Porthos in his Chateau of Pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent Monsieur Mouston	23.79927635192871
I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together	66.6256103515625
Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts DArtagnan	184.85850524902344
Believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they can not understand it	111.5877685546875
And Aramis	159.28306579589844
I have seen him also said DArtagnan but he seemed to me cold	9.544330596923828
Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on DArtagnan a searching look	23.903459548950195
Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would say	50.07453536987305
Why yes replied DArtagnan with embarrassment	32.27708053588867
Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women	140.24298095703125
I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said DArtagnan	48.753822326660156
Athos made no reply	100.98096466064453
He is not curious thought DArtagnan	38.53066635131836
Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	169.19171142578125
You see said he calling DArtagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains	59.20161437988281
All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied DArtagnan	2.000459671020508
At this instant they heard the sound of horses feet	55.026737213134766
Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child is	260.5330810546875
In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and DArtagnan	175.77516174316406
Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on DArtagnans shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier DArtagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Raoul	977.5032348632812
Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman	41.175025939941406
That little compliment could not fail to move DArtagnan	153.65757751464844
He extended a hand to Raoul and said	54.91541290283203
My young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions	176.69493103027344
But he will make it up in you I am sure	147.84963989257812
I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched me	224.55319213867188
Athos was more delighted than can be told	230.7090301513672
He looked at DArtagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them	61.75227355957031
Now said DArtagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of it	117.28758239746094
I hope the accident has been of no consequence	107.7071304321289
They do nt yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured	198.69100952148438
At this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce supper	66.9144515991211
Athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent flowers	147.29879760742188
DArtagnan glanced at the dinner service	92.6119384765625
The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	133.27085876464844
DArtagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	71.07697296142578
That workmanship is divine he exclaimed	89.48487091064453
Yes a chef doeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Athos	152.38861083984375
What battle does it represent	77.65606689453125
That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis I	348.51910400390625
who has broken his	86.73175811767578
It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of St	137.34104919433594
Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship	424.4659423828125
Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in comparison	229.41839599609375
Let us sit down to supper	33.21597671508789
Call Charles he added addressing the boy who waited	57.54888153076172
My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur DArtagnan	76.69098663330078
He likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	238.33714294433594
He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wo nt object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of you	75.65129852294922
Charles bowed and retired	83.70797729492188
You think of everything said DArtagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Athos	79.70650482177734
Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed	191.68971252441406
That name sounds strange to you said Athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when Monsieur DArtagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle under the deceased cardinal and Monsieur de Bassompierre	127.63175964355469
My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear it	942.8151245117188
Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it	150.9956512451172
What do you mean sir inquired Raoul	54.111263275146484
You have not forgotten St	18.682851791381836
Gervais Athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to Raoul the story of the bastion and Raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by Tasso and Ariosto	129.12997436523438
DArtagnan does not tell you Raoul said Athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his timea knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire that s what his adversary met with	41.280513763427734
He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried men	51.98090744018555
And did Monsieur DArtagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening eye	247.08590698242188
I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied DArtagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I do nt remember which	205.70355224609375
Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of skill	123.91553497314453
The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose	87.9434585571289
DArtagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Raoul	59.01311492919922
Chapter XV	201.28115844726562
Athos as a Diplomatist	102.52424621582031
DArtagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening	465.009765625
Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard	44.281410217285156
He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	284.18389892578125
Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	1507.9749755859375
Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him What could explain Athoss having reentered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table The absence of Grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by Athos gave DArtagnan uneasiness	282.56268310546875
It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants visit	19.135238647460938
He could not help thinking of M	28.684062957763672
Rochefort whom he had seen in Notre Dame could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos Again the moderate fortune which Athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	66.55184936523438
The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be	221.3214874267578
He would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity	43.0123291015625
Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day DArtagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast	21.529621124267578
He determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth Raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the present	471.1909484863281
But DArtagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Athos	144.7399139404297
Besides to tell truth whilst DArtagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos truehearted open Athos	1178.718017578125
It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that Athos on the contrary would despise him	87.98213195800781
Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought DArtagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence	104.82774353027344
There reigned a perfect stillness in the house	164.0623321533203
DArtagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	112.94371032714844
At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep	43.34196853637695
Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of Athos	393.4840087890625
He is walking about and thinking thought DArtagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that	128.01611328125
At length Athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	182.9736328125
Silence and fatigue together overcame DArtagnan and sleep overtook him also	20.794330596923828
He was not however a good sleeper	60.923797607421875
Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows	118.23099517822266
Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	189.82286071777344
True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know DArtagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Raoul	117.99208068847656
The young man was opening the door of the stable	65.7416000366211
He then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchengarden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and DArtagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia	35.32642364501953
The road as DArtagnan had observed was the way to Blois	62.83639144897461
So thought the Gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who does nt at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair sex	79.74615478515625
He s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms he s not going on a message for he goes secretly	71.92200469970703
Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his father	43.43935775756836
By Jove I shall know about that soon for I shall soon speak out to Athos	32.10527038574219
Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other	54.51478576660156
The bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the Loire even became alive and vocal	1590.7276611328125
The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current	94.0809555053711
The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs	25.286705017089844
Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	434.6580810546875
Goodmorning my dear host cried DArtagnan	164.83432006835938
Goodday to you have you slept well	218.48748779296875
Excellently Athos but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier	269.0382080078125
My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being so	11.444162368774414
In the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities	68.06949615478516
I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this morning	212.6767120361328
These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border	100.9286880493164
DArtagnan began to smile	39.555755615234375
Ah you think so do you	134.56015014648438
And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	116.84330749511719
Here are the horses hoofs again it seems Athos he said carelessly	6.161916732788086
Yes indeed the marks are recent	46.6314582824707
Quite so replied the lieutenant	52.33987045288086
Who went out this morning Athos asked uneasily	81.99214172363281
Has any horse got loose	256.24462890625
Not likely answered the Gascon these marks are regular	242.79061889648438
Where is Raoul asked Athos how is it that I have not seen him	42.39215087890625
Hush exclaimed DArtagnan putting his finger on his lips and he related what he had seen watching Athos all the while	540.6021728515625
Ah he s gone to Blois the poor boy	228.07981872558594
Ah to inquire after the little La Valliere she has sprained her foot you know	190.0562744140625
You think he has	30.983491897583008
I am sure of it said Athos do nt you see that Raoul is in love	224.6372528076172
Indeed with whomwith a child seven years old	61.97670364379883
Dear friend at Raouls age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real	38.46195602416992
Well his love is half real half fanciful	215.47096252441406
She is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyesat once saucy and languishing	141.9086456298828
But what say you to Raouls fancy	100.2280044555664
NothingI laugh at Raoul but this first desire of the heart is imperious	24.835559844970703
I remember just at his age how deep in love I was with a Grecian statue which our good king then Henry IV	334.46954345703125
gave my father insomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story of Pygmalion was nothing but a fable	102.45680236816406
It is mere want of occupation	49.99281692504883
You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself	49.017372131347656
Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from here	66.5540771484375
You will be wise to do so	37.2175178527832
No doubt of it but it will break his heart	121.20565032958984
So long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	63.97241973876953
The parents of little La Valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned	24.600492477416992
Nonsense However Raoul must be diverted from this fancy	49.218231201171875
Send him away or you will never make a man of him	23.887882232666016
I think I shall send him to Paris	64.87271881103516
So thought DArtagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived	114.53627014160156
Suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	2.818423271179199
I wish to consult you about some thing	108.41283416748047
Do so	69.8035659790039
Do you think it is time for us to enter the service	214.06600952148438
But are you not still in the serviceyou DArtagnan	169.41339111328125
I mean active service	307.56585693359375
Our former life has it still no attractions for you would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of Porthos the exploits of our youth	46.659542083740234
Do you propose to me to do so DArtagnan	139.78111267089844
Decidedly and honestly	23.205751419067383
On whose side asked Athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the Gascon	75.45528411865234
Ah devil take it you speak in earnest	119.46549987792969
And must have a definite answer	72.2507553100586
Listen DArtagnan	123.20574188232422
There is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefulthat of the king	134.27857971191406
Exactly answered the musketeer	36.38176727294922
Yes but let us understand each other returned Athos seriously	84.91265869140625
If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin we do not understand each other	470.4969787597656
I do nt say exactly answered the Gascon confused	32.33431625366211
Come DArtagnan do nt let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice	26.537750244140625
Ah my dear Athos	31.473224639892578
You know that I am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men	485.1227722167969
I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italianof the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillowof the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the kingwho wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinalour cardinal didof the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morningof the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they sayso much the worse for herand who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me I thank you DArtagnan	91.08430480957031
You are more impetuous than you were returned DArtagnan	17.21827507019043
Age has warmed not chilled your blood	184.08416748046875
Who informed you this was the master I propose to you Devil take it he muttered to himself do nt let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them	63.05126190185547
Well then said Athos what are your schemes what do you propose	293.6500549316406
Zounds nothing more than natural	90.11702728271484
You live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity	324.09136962890625
Porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	31.959245681762695
Aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer but Iwhat have I in the world I have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living	49.00462341308594
In fact I am dead	18.350027084350586
Well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master By Jove I am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living	148.59910583496094
Athos was for a few moments thoughtful	45.064571380615234
Good DArtagnan is for Mazarin he said to himself	40.80195236206055
From that moment he grew very guarded	114.96146392822266
On his side DArtagnan became more cautious also	14.006933212280273
You spoke to me Athos resumed of Porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune But he has wealth I believe already	47.264339447021484
Doubtless he has	155.35598754882812
But such is man we always want something more than we already have	74.93722534179688
What does Porthos wish for	52.794212341308594
To be a baron	44.18929672241211
Ah true I forgot said Athos laughing	52.26380157470703
Tis true thought the Gascon where has he heard it Does he correspond with Aramis Ah if I knew that he did I should know all	197.0348358154297
The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul	58.72583770751953
Is our little neighbor worse asked DArtagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	56.02482986450195
Ah sir replied Raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life	447.122802734375
This is terrible said Athos	21.02916717529297
And what makes me all the more wretched sir is that I was the cause of this misfortune	60.32460403442383
How so asked Athos	7.120925426483154
It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood	166.15185546875
There s only one remedy dear Raoulthat is to marry her as a compensation	2.000459671020508
remarked DArtagnan	11.655535697937012
Ah sir answered Raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed	90.68724060058594
The good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the mornings skirmish	182.8929443359375
They breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor Raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all	71.42546081542969
After breakfast two letters arrived for Athos who read them with profound attention whilst DArtagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of Aramis	91.2134780883789
The other was in a feminine hand long and crossed	187.7513427734375
Come said DArtagnan to Raoul seeing that Athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you	67.650390625
And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match	465.403076171875
In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for DArtagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered	121.78527069091797
It was now Athoss turn to take a sly look	86.30439758300781
DArtagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head	159.1269989013672
See dear friend what it is to belong to the army	137.877197265625
Faith you are indeed right not to return to it	45.89037322998047
Monsieur de Trville is ill so my company ca nt do without me there my leave is at an end	20.568382263183594
Do you return to Paris asked Athos quickly	136.88031005859375
Egad yes but why do nt you come there also	198.42193603515625
Athos colored a little and answered	202.6354522705078
Should I go I shall be delighted to see you there	200.84579467773438
Halloo Planchet cried the Gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay	68.73394775390625
Then turning to Athos he added	33.61918258666992
I seem to miss something here	79.73394775390625
I am really sorry to go away without having seen Grimaud	182.499267578125
Grimaud replied Athos	196.01235961914062
I m surprised you have never so much as asked after him	70.1059799194336
I have lent him to a friend	39.51681900024414
Who will understand the signs he makes returned DArtagnan	75.74071502685547
I hope so	103.44001007080078
The friends embraced cordially DArtagnan pressed Raouls hand	116.9953384399414
Will you not come with me he said I shall pass by Blois	77.64714813232422
Raoul turned toward Athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go	36.232025146484375
No monsieur replied the young man I will remain with monsieur le comte	50.579593658447266
Adieu then to both my good friends said DArtagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said goodbye to each other in the late cardinals time	124.78306579589844
Athos waved his hand Raoul bowed and DArtagnan and Planchet set out	28.168500900268555
The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said	47.1071891784668
Raoul we set out tonight for Paris	211.89877319335938
Eh cried the young man turning pale	202.26841735839844
You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de SaintRemy	103.63279724121094
I shall wait for you here till seven	180.71054077148438
The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse	34.51262664794922
As to DArtagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again	47.28330612182617
Return immediately to Paris	165.0105743408203
The epistle is laconic said DArtagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript	58.3841667175293
And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter	78.77503967285156
Go to the kings treasurer at Blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pistoles	113.26569366455078
Assuredly said DArtagnan I admire this piece of prose	90.23463439941406
The cardinal writes better than I thought	512.1524047851562
Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set off	17.78445053100586
Toward Paris sir	493.4792785644531
Toward Paris	50.192073822021484
And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain	32.74787902832031
Chapter XVI	32.48848342895508
The Duc de Beaufort	4230.84814453125
The circumstances that had hastened the return of DArtagnan to Paris were as follows	205.49179077148438
One evening when Mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guardchamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolflike step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink	68.02890014648438
There was a dispute among the guards	85.39207458496094
I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician	208.27734375
Deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so	62.81644058227539
Because he may be tried for it	89.56759643554688
Ah absurd they do nt burn sorcerers nowadays	143.32655334472656
No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier though	242.15667724609375
My friend Urban Grandier was nt a sorcerer he was a learned man	229.00645446777344
He did nt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing	115.23632049560547
Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place	362.899658203125
I do nt say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true	114.0218505859375
How so	153.1822052001953
Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape	27.055278778076172
Good Lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny If it is written yonder in Heaven that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it	146.9673614501953
Mazarin started	36.053653717041016
He was an Italian and therefore superstitious	36.37739562988281
He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	207.66268920898438
What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not	166.87844848632812
Oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier	38.92972946166992
He s well guarded now we only said he would escape	57.0427131652832
Who said so	60.66489791870117
Repeat your story Saint Laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale	112.69947814941406
My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsuntide	96.30866241455078
Coysel is a madman returned the cardinal	138.36940002441406
No replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc de Guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	71.08307647705078
Well the queen has not only one son but two then Monsieur de Coligny was killed and	43.58940505981445
Yes said Mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal	57.0548210144043
No my lord but he will be answered the guard	34.67774963378906
Mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say But he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added	46.98950958251953
So my friend its your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will escape	105.18550872802734
That s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes I should refuse it	19.71493911743164
After Whitsuntide it would be another thing	46.01771926879883
There is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction	90.60179138183594
It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superstitious	208.92288208007812
He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	53.51893615722656
The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point	141.1249237060547
During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape	23.272865295410156
It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV	90.11397552490234
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age	83.3345718383789
But however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his lifes best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison Meantime Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke	62.686161041259766
But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure	242.37489318847656
Often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beaufort	45.06310272216797
Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at Vincennes	25.324182510375977
So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him his first words were Well what s the matter Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes	118.61610412597656
I do not think so my lord said Bernouin but you will hear about him for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence	52.590370178222656
Tell him to come in said Mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed	2.000459671020508
The officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy	46.762420654296875
His air of perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy	123.54967498779297
Approach sir said the cardinal	69.87716674804688
The officer obeyed	85.59337615966797
Do you know what they are saying here	29.53626823425293
No your eminence	141.93157958984375
Well they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from Vincennes if he has not done so already	34.54275894165039
The officers face expressed complete stupefaction	73.21995544433594
He opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	112.93962860107422
Escape my lordescape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is	69.02033233642578
Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vincennes	228.10418701171875
Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm	48.80342483520508
Sir replied Mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watchspring one may saw through an iron bar	167.14881896972656
Then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him	109.6038818359375
But he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the Mall	44.64415740966797
Sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission	83.04254150390625
No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement	167.0111541748047
He then asked with whom he played	84.59569549560547
My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me	63.260231018066406
But does he not approach the walls while playing	286.881591796875
Your eminence does nt know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off	265.0856018066406
Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable	203.51478576660156
You mean to say then my dear Monsieur la Ramee	41.58262252807617
That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird I will continue answerable for him	193.76663208007812
Take care you assert a great deal said Mazarin	73.01077270507812
Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping	193.10169982910156
My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago	75.65520477294922
Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Mazarin	59.50668716430664
Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beaufort	173.77371215820312
Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes absent	120.63729858398438
When he is absent I am there	943.5266723632812
But when you leave him for instance	63.281436920166016
Oh when I leave him I place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majestys special guard	72.65167999267578
I promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner	120.6549072265625
During the three weeks that he has been with me I have only had to reproach him with one thingbeing too severe with the prisoners	163.07131958007812
And who is this Cerberus	190.52511596679688
A certain Monsieur Grimaud my lord	136.4731903076172
And what was he before he went to Vincennes	238.0775909423828
He was in the country as I was told by the person who recommended him to me	239.12841796875
And who recommended this man to you	98.84684753417969
The steward of the Duc de Grammont	62.441471099853516
He is not a gossip I hope	27.52106285095215
Lord a mercy my lord I thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	61.37528610229492
It seems his former master accustomed him to that	48.51930618286133
Well dear Monsieur la Ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the kings health	261.19708251953125
Mazarin was large in promisesquite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee for he said nothing and did much	94.1258316040039
It was now nine oclock	135.7576141357422
The cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him	88.95567321777344
The queen who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all La Ramees praises of his deputy	82.72167205810547
Then when the cardinal had ended	31.46003532409668
Alas sir why have we not a Grimaud near every prince	44.199954986572266
Patience replied Mazarin with his Italian smile that may happen one day but in the meantime	29.241724014282227
Well in the meantime	81.29690551757812
I shall still take precautions	98.15237426757812
And he wrote to DArtagnan to hasten his return	39.39990997314453
Chapter XVII	56.86027526855469
Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes	81.89598083496094
The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal	107.74354553222656
He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape	111.10444641113281
His vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose	263.9801330566406
The duke was the grandson of Henry IV	66.53925323486328
and Gabrielle dEstreesas goodnatured as brave as proud and above all as Gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated	131.57388305664062
After having been for some time after the death of Louis XIII	90.79589080810547
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	61.03074264526367
It is understood of course that when we say the queen Mazarin is meant	51.64366912841797
During the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man M	38.84345245361328
de Beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans	34.55781555175781
But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister	61.115867614746094
After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing	118.81803131103516
He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin	137.53274536132812
Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	44.17024612426758
The next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mottoes	71.46964263916016
Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles	149.8860321044922
de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	144.45521545410156
The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarins life	129.5149383544922
In one was depicted the Illustrious Coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the Illustrious Mazarin acting the part of Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the Illustrious Mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de Chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin refusing to give Laporte the young kings valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of France to have clean sheets every three months	55.6118278503418
The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner	354.0105285644531
To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael Angelo	103.3932113647461
Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed	265.01873779296875
The poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior of Vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter	47.9560432434082
His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	164.4728546142578
With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education	132.51089477539062
At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment	139.93450927734375
The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor	116.89997863769531
Pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a ropedancer	67.24437713623047
Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again	334.6376647949219
The intelligent creature was received with loud applause	61.297489166259766
The first part of the entertainment being concluded Pistache was desired to say what oclock it was he was shown Monsieur de Chavignys watch it was then halfpast six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised	159.05523681640625
Nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater precision	104.84589385986328
Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in France	63.438724517822266
The dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	307.21685791015625
Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world	225.5926055908203
Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark	63.122467041015625
See gentlemen said M	66.36389923095703
de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer	384.6863708496094
Pistache my friend come here	380.6378173828125
Is not the greatest thief in the world Monsieur the kings secretary Le Camus who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions	80.33139038085938
The dog shook his head	12.176518440246582
Then is it not resumed the duke the Superintendent Emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the Tuileries are a heap of ruins and the Louvre a paltry building	56.04356384277344
The dog again shook his head as if to say no	1521.353759765625
Then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	275.2415466308594
Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey	74.18429565429688
Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively	80.15228271484375
Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pistache	124.28935241699219
Let us go on to another of his exercises	116.70048522949219
Gentlementhere was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed themdo you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair Pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs	110.23656463623047
Monsieur de Chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane	169.23931884765625
Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort	122.02046203613281
Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot	2.000459671020508
Now Pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montbazon	391.7139892578125
But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de Pons	138.45790100097656
Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the queen	160.7937469482422
And he raised his cane six inches higher	358.87005615234375
The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	175.16127014160156
And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king	66.24053955078125
The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	134.4893341064453
Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina	148.3211212158203
The dog turned his back to the cane	65.77135467529297
What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache	117.6513900756836
Jump then Monsieur Pistache	35.64017105102539
But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	44.36151123046875
Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistaches patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth	49.29008483886719
Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks	62.07830047607422
Three days afterward Pistache was found deadpoisoned	104.38421630859375
Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned him	372.0400695800781
This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	50.40786361694336
The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy and Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenica bon mot which had great success	77.65166473388672
So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster	176.21473693847656
Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pistache	44.4592399597168
De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieus and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood tyranny	48.40653610229492
He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	66.94879150390625
A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day	60.54271697998047
One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use	10.456497192382812
Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort	164.1961669921875
At last his patience was exhausted	53.47557067871094
He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows	134.89166259765625
Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry IV	139.20562744140625
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy	87.30851745605469
Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my care	76.98457336425781
The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	117.86690521240234
Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Mazarin	62.60944366455078
You shall be my bodyguard	48.92570495605469
I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward	47.626914978027344
But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV	11.475255966186523
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun	80.91265106201172
Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison	391.53436279296875
My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns	82.37425994873047
I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded	79.30139923095703
Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang youat which I should be most unhappy certainly	72.98835754394531
And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavigny	299.79052734375
For myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up dead or alive	238.12391662597656
And once more he bowed low before his highness	267.1661071777344
These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus	109.26036834716797
Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee	217.83160400390625
La Ramee came into the room	49.65797424316406
La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant	120.45249938964844
La Ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorruptibility	97.89884948730469
Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV	84.2169189453125
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family	88.82373046875
One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband	83.42855834960938
La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat	110.32064819335938
Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life	21.724702835083008
He accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the Duc de Grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	233.54124450683594
We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself Athos had given Grimaud permission to speak	47.70368194580078
But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature	114.46212005615234
Chapter XVIII	16.016624450683594
Grimaud begins his Functions	269.35345458984375
Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vincennes	42.424766540527344
Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheekbones of Grimaud were favorable signs	35.37138366699219
He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in four	76.03878784179688
Heres a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavigny	57.26802062988281
Go he added and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects	56.18826675415039
Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	52.047115325927734
So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grimaud	37.63081741333008
My orders asked Grimaud	162.55218505859375
They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers	119.03158569335938
Those are all asked Grimaud	19.57009506225586
All now replied La Ramee	65.80755615234375
Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	47.399269104003906
The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition	123.62168884277344
But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him	54.76431655883789
The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it	51.64471435546875
As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow	52.43953323364258
The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	71.04356384277344
The figure put the comb in its pocket	213.65289306640625
Ho hey what s that cried the duke	68.60237884521484
Who is this creature	24.363094329833984
Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time	775.99951171875
Art thou dumb cried the duke	42.234375
Grimaud made a sign that he was not	56.514068603515625
What art thou then Answer I command thee said the duke	100.5619125366211
A keeper replied Grimaud	213.29000854492188
A keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallowsbird	57.58445739746094
Halloo La Ramee some one	102.37490844726562
La Ramee ran in haste to obey the call	69.73074340820312
Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke	254.0000457763672
One of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as I and Monsieur de Chavigny do I am sure	115.96835327148438
Why does he take my comb	108.34957885742188
Why do you take my lords comb asked La Ramee	235.6556854248047
Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Pointed	24.137907028198242
True said La Ramee	1680.785888671875
What does the animal say asked the duke	107.28884887695312
That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument	172.054443359375
Are you mad La Ramee You yourself gave me this comb	207.95272827148438
I was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my orders	743.777587890625
The duke looked furiously at Grimaud	28.479921340942383
I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered	210.91238403320312
Grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner	762.7545166015625
A fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke	120.68327331542969
He had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his roomthe red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinalso that he might have the pleasure of hanging Mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish	287.55596923828125
The day was employed in preparations for the execution	396.6597900390625
Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become so	290.3125305175781
In the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him	75.37627410888672
When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	122.81070709228516
Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	38.925514221191406
The guards looked on it with indifference	47.4681396484375
When everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared	41.307167053222656
Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	140.43992614746094
Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so	6009.14892578125
What thou again Why didst thou take it	48.690792083740234
Yeswhy asked La Ramee	106.25051879882812
Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said Sharp	30.857982635498047
True my lord exclaimed La Ramee	120.68937683105469
Ah deuce take it we have a precious fellow here	141.17776489257812
Monsieur Grimaud said the duke for your sake I beg of you never come within the reach of my fist	180.52967834472656
Hush hush cried La Ramee give me your gibbet my lord	28.96082878112793
I will shape it out for you with my knife	84.47940063476562
And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	104.85894012451172
That s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst I go and fetch the culprit	222.7211456298828
La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread	62.14577102661133
Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	105.92741394042969
La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even smile	41.90637969970703
He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread	73.85945892333984
Cardinal he said	33.21855163574219
Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee the kings commissioner	21.749868392944336
La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window	47.1062126159668
He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his hands	86.1148452758789
Good to eat he said and put it in his pocket	3228.096923828125
This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct	205.1511993408203
But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside	78.3054428100586
Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	79.29175567626953
The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to him	62.262691497802734
One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	31.178945541381836
Go away he said	70.87407684326172
The guard obeyed	49.079933166503906
You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat you	20.457155227661133
Grimaud bowed	52.05562973022461
I will break every bone in your body cried the duke	120.53081512451172
Grimaud bowed but stepped back	114.26023864746094
Spy cried the duke more and more enraged I will strangle you with my own hands	297.02593994140625
And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	94.2630844116211
At the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone	76.90726470947266
Hush smiling as he uttered the word	94.1502456665039
A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded	75.355224609375
Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	275.7682189941406
The duke more and more bewildered let Grimaud loose and took the note	64.849609375
From Madame de Montbazon he cried	17.169116973876953
Grimaud nodded assent	11.599780082702637
The duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read	36.97305679321289
My Dear DukeYou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at Vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving	34.13410568237305
The moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained	34.29790496826172
Yours wholly and most affectionately	241.86322021484375
Marie de Montbazon	31.284442901611328
I sign my full name for I should be vain if I could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials	130.5856475830078
The poor duke became perfectly giddy	117.41741180419922
What for five years he had been wantinga faithful servant a friend a helping handseemed to have fallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least	52.62483596801758
Oh dearest Marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation Heavens there is constancy Then turning to Grimaud he said	142.76034545898438
And thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me	30.282222747802734
Grimaud signified his assent	91.01093292236328
And you have come here with that purpose	52.72727966308594
Grimaud repeated the sign	42.64225769042969
And I was ready to strangle you cried the duke	154.16566467285156
Grimaud smiled	601.6126708984375
Wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	33.006919860839844
Wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of Henry IV	171.6350555419922
went without recompense	166.89483642578125
The dukes endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money	130.49520874023438
Whereupon Grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	209.34030151367188
Here is what you are looking for he said	69.28370666503906
The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimauds hands but Grimaud shook his head	191.9555206298828
Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am paid	87.38011932373047
The duke went from one surprise to another	94.52667236328125
He held out his hand	23.144126892089844
Grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully	24.595577239990234
The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grimaud	175.1619415283203
What shall we do and when and how proceed	112.34000396728516
It is now eleven answered Grimaud	213.00167846679688
Let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts	39.73972702026367
And then	92.07522583007812
Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again	55.68660354614258
I understand said the duke	196.82476806640625
Grimaud made a sign that he was going away	130.27908325195312
Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me	132.94189453125
I wish my lord would make me one promise	106.92807006835938
What speak	69.02754211425781
Tis this when we escape together that I shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if I am caught the least that can befall me is to behung	44.76632308959961
True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest	326.2751770019531
Now resumed Grimaud I ve only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest me	54.94715881347656
Ill try said the duke	63.701961517333984
At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room	103.60958099365234
The duke had thrown himself as he was wo nt to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed	72.64273834228516
La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction	117.34688568115234
Then turning to Grimaud	36.49173355102539
Very good my friend very good	137.4471893310547
You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to you	200.41165161132812
Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior	2.000459671020508
Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow	96.30636596679688
So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back again	139.23756408691406
I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I might nt break my promise and strangle Grimaud	312.40155029296875
I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness	150.37254333496094
Pardieu you are righta mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you again	139.99623107910156
Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the compliment	114.11002349853516
Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of description	48.37181091308594
Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Ramee	32.403175354003906
If you wish it	75.3910140991211
I am at your service my lord	165.8920440673828
I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your society	82.38298034667969
My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled	129.5492706298828
What do you mean Have you seen him lately	67.45332336425781
He sent for me today	73.85498809814453
Really to speak to you about me	189.185546875
Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his nightmare	61.92630386352539
The duke smiled with bitterness	68.51026153564453
Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your fortune	150.50625610351562
How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated	223.4092254638672
I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of Paris	81.20838165283203
Pshaw pshaw I can not hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud	55.1233024597168
Very well let us say no more about it	2168.227783203125
So you and the cardinal have been talking about me La Ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes I will go in your stead I will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition I will return to prison	144.9214630126953
Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grimaud	1.57447350025177
Well I am wrong	151.2052459716797
And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me	69.9637451171875
I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	177.13856506347656
What did he say to me He told me to watch you	58.25446701049805
And why so why watch me asked the duke uneasily	85.86480712890625
Because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape	384.6219787597656
Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself	40.83391571044922
Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people	17.483291625976562
And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence	69.37716674804688
That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy one	41.42701721191406
Why not	40.45528030395508
Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird	44.20059585571289
Unfortunately that is true	1026.4552001953125
Let us go and have a game at tennis La Ramee	44.724037170410156
My lordI beg your highnesss pardonbut I must beg for half an hours leave of absence	71.22452545166016
Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast	52.59873580932617
Well shall I send for some breakfast here	2658.72998046875
No my lord I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castleDaddy Marteau as they called him	11.202169418334961
Well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris an invalid ordered country air for his health	46.966712951660156
Well what have I to do with that	15.94113826751709
Why good Lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon	69.34197998046875
I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though I ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet	52.73576736450195
But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good	495.1553955078125
My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once	137.46087646484375
I can not I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau	238.3281707763672
Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an hour	360.8769226074219
In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith no	1531.845458984375
Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burgundy	106.13819885253906
So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highnesss leave And La Ramee bent low	76.69007110595703
Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an hour	264.59814453125
May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord	78.21894836425781
Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my family	98.92162322998047
La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment	109.54154205322266
But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not	80.97718811035156
But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance	71.45079803466797
Chapter XIX	58.2254753112793
Pts made by the Successor of Father Marteau are described	53.70395278930664
In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts content	17.487668991088867
The pates were excellent the wine delicious	69.67670440673828
The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	372.1534729003906
At two oclock the tennis balls began according to Grimauds directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of La Ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over	86.82630157470703
La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat	36.94425964355469
Hey friend cried the duke	345.15472412109375
The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	380.5495910644531
The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bastile	53.923912048339844
Well Who s up there said the man	55.07771301269531
Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke	96.83610534667969
The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the guard	343.9901123046875
One however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket	12.641335487365723
La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood	120.73196411132812
The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away	19.9777774810791
La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir	51.608970642089844
However the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter	42.96760177612305
My LordYour friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand	81.00912475585938
Ask day after tomorrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre dhotel	137.15989685058594
Do not open the pie till you are alone	25.871076583862305
I hope you will be satisfied with its contents	106.30362701416016
Your highnesss most devoted servant	83.0842056274414
In the Bastile as elsewhere	231.08425903320312
Comte de Rochefort	176.7478485107422
The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster	177.39553833007812
La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince	78.41414642333984
He endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	215.61444091796875
Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteaus successor	270.572509765625
Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent	119.14186096191406
In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavigny	255.344970703125
Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your patronage	69.91979217529297
You are right said the duke	311.8779296875
If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gourmand	101.16034698486328
My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice do nt put that off till you are old	258.4723205566406
Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramees is gluttony	153.53842163085938
Let us then take advantage of it	141.26321411132812
Then aloud	98.31698608398438
Well my dear La Ramee the day after tomorrow is a holiday	280.12188720703125
Yes my lordPentecost	37.71424865722656
Will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow	95.87337493896484
In what	191.83848571777344
In gastronomy	143.3992156982422
Willingly my lord	330.89898681640625
But teteatete	99.06768035888672
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny well have a supper here under your direction	117.35494232177734
Hum said La Ramee	69.53845977783203
The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set	77.5540771484375
Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison	596.8921508789062
Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine	232.88113403320312
As to getting him drunk the duke could nt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it	125.8664321899414
Then an idea came to him which harmonized everything	19.128124237060547
The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	40.97832489013672
But presently the exempts face suddenly brightened	126.69161224365234
Well he asked that will do will it not	130.2570343017578
Yes my lord on one condition	47.40848159790039
That Grimaud shall wait on us at table	17.06614875793457
Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim	121.21652221679688
To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the feast	174.95425415039062
I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he does nt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away	22.64679718017578
Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me	210.58599853515625
My lord the day after tomorrow is Pentecost	301.291259765625
Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison	40.75019454956055
No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician predicted	69.8897933959961
And what was it	41.8486213684082
That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vincennes	207.021728515625
You believe in sorcerers then you fool	89.01104736328125
II mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superstitious	102.80602264404297
The duke shrugged his shoulders	60.862911224365234
Well then with well acted goodhumor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it all	60.18886947631836
Order whatever you like for supperthe only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when I leave my prison	40.99566650390625
Then you think you will some day leave it said La Ramee	105.89373016357422
The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Mazarin	58.2269172668457
I am fifteen years younger than he is	18.40314292907715
At Vincennes tis true one lives faster	376.9917907714844
My lord replied La Ramee my lord	169.36170959472656
Or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing	72.48796081542969
La Ramee was going out	46.15031433105469
He stopped however at the door for an instant	106.2713851928711
Whom does your highness wish me to send to you	111.71063232421875
Any one except Grimaud	37.70795440673828
The officer of the guard then with his chessboard	59.022090911865234
Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess	43.55160140991211
A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope	67.43759155273438
The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	42.12372589111328
Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	36.01633071899414
And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	36.888092041015625
He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him	381.3088684082031
It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something	33.025333404541016
So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game	124.84806060791016
But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep	26.979595184326172
So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting	100.85474395751953
The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like St	267.6634216308594
Laurence on his gridiron	84.58750915527344
Finally he slept	8.286388397216797
But at daybreak he awoke	49.805259704589844
Wild dreams had disturbed his repose	10.721928596496582
He dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly away	15.342918395996094
For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him	8561.56640625
His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen	240.51222229003906
He fell asleep again and another vision appeared	1645.010986328125
He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vincennes	1200.8575439453125
Grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	36.13310241699219
By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course	605.6137084960938
At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	42.08162307739258
The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	178.58518981933594
He made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	71.14234924316406
Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front advancing	68.42863464355469
He wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	97.94871520996094
Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	23.735366821289062
These steps came on came fast	73.11420440673828
He was discovered all hope of flight was gone	54.078365325927734
Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies	88.88626098632812
At last he heard the voice of La Ramee	459.1896057128906
La Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	899.3016967773438
He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had died	657.2705688476562
Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant	39.267669677734375
The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill	23.11880111694336
In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help	190.304931640625
What is the matter with your highness asked La Ramee	86.95918273925781
Tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	102.37773132324219
With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so	71.67024230957031
La Ramee laughed	49.44136047363281
Come he said tis a warning from Heaven	168.0393829345703
Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams	275.6976013183594
And you are right my dear La Ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this I will think of nothing but eating and drinking	133.6599578857422
Hush said La Ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts	29.528783798217773
Well asked the duke when they were alone	73.03580474853516
Well replied La Ramee your supper is ordered	71.44129180908203
Ah and what is it to be Monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie	247.15696716308594
I should think so indeedalmost as high as a tower	438.9095458984375
You told him it was for me	2.000459671020508
Yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness	43.110435485839844
Good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	36.08549499511719
Devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing I have nt seen you with so cheerful a face these five years	69.97015380859375
The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La Ramees ideas Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to him	32.95166778564453
La Ramee drew near to Grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	19.457311630249023
The duke meanwhile recovered his selfcontrol	23.695589065551758
I have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission	17.024486541748047
You must pardon him my lord said La Ramee for I directed him to come	71.07565307617188
And why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me	65.8835678100586
My lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper	50.40042495727539
My lord has forgotten the supper	268.0197448730469
No but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud	61.86329650878906
My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present	32.41562271118164
Go on then have it your own way	43.3170166015625
Come here my lad said La Ramee and hear what I have to say	108.26436614990234
Grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	108.7093505859375
La Ramee continued My lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper tomorrow en teteatete	272.12933349609375
Grimaud made a sign which meant that he did nt see what that had to do with him	99.95919799804688
Yes yes said La Ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours	518.2401123046875
Grimaud bowed in thanks	56.48782730102539
And now said La Ramee I must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure	99.51841735839844
The duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud but there was no glance in Grimauds eyes	114.50726318359375
Go then said the duke and return as soon as possible	184.83348083496094
Does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday	262.24749755859375
Grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	98.93006896972656
Yes said the duke but take care my dear La Ramee for I propose to beat you badly	54.17229461669922
La Ramee went out	13.965317726135254
Grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper	15.827119827270508
Write my lord he said	37.575260162353516
And what	115.92562866210938
Grimaud dictated	72.54432678222656
All is ready for tomorrow evening	130.6750946044922
Keep watch from seven to nine	19.524770736694336
Have two riding horses ready	23.009286880493164
We shall descend by the first window in the gallery	129.15139770507812
What next	277.4517517089844
Sign your name my lord	755.5382690429688
The duke signed	289.9724426269531
Now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ballthat which contained the letter	122.84051513671875
The duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to Grimaud	98.4843978881836
Grimaud gave a grim smile	59.210872650146484
Well asked the duke	92.71731567382812
Well my lord I sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch	1032.4625244140625
But will it not be lost	183.20751953125
Oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up	175.46688842773438
A gardener	177.14508056640625
Grimaud nodded	162.0052032470703
The same as yesterday	53.10518264770508
Another nod on the part of Grimaud	112.27257537841797
The Count de Rochefort	37.912906646728516
Grimaud nodded the third time	51.194820404052734
Come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape	74.65653991699219
That is forbidden me said Grimaud until the last moment	34.337162017822266
Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch	19.277448654174805
I know nothing about it my lord	340.1758117675781
But at least if you do nt want to see me turn crazy tell what that famous pate will contain	35.35159683227539
Two poniards a knotted rope and a poire dangoisse	57.333763122558594
This poire dangoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width	104.6747055053711
Yes I understand	83.54663848876953
My lord observes that there will be enough to go around	65.20368957519531
We shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke	29.691591262817383
And make La Ramee eat the pear answered Grimaud	41.36502456665039
My dear Grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justicethy words are words of gold	27.830400466918945
Chapter XX	112.3357162475586
One of Marie Michons Adventures	51.30837631225586
Whilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and Grimaud the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were entering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel	50.48160934448242
They stopped at the sign of the Fox in the Rue du Vieux Colombier a tavern known for many years by Athos and asked for two bedrooms	125.3711929321289
You must dress yourself Raoul said Athos I am going to present you to some one	38.34751892089844
Today monsieur asked the young man	275.9390869140625
In half an hour	98.07588195800781
The young man bowed	12.951061248779297
Perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of Athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river Seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey	48.95709228515625
By the way said Athos take some pains with your toilet Raoul I want you to be approved	173.51248168945312
I hope sir replied the youth smiling that there s no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to Louise	154.48789978027344
Athos in his turn smiled also	92.84646606445312
No do nt be alarmed although it is to a lady that I am going to present you and I am anxious that you should love her	33.87113571166992
The young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from Athos he was quickly reassured	125.59951782226562
How old is she inquired the Vicomte de Bragelonne	113.35841369628906
My dear Raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	543.4358520507812
When you can find out a womans age by her face it is useless to ask it when you can not do so it is indiscreet	65.0856704711914
Is she beautiful	36.87629699707031
Sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in France	180.5167694091797
This reply reassured the vicomte	162.34010314941406
A woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	105.32688903808594
He retired to his toilet	286.97833251953125
When he reappeared Athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on DArtagnan but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face	105.70106506347656
Athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	46.22983169555664
The youths dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day	27.766826629638672
Gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old	122.8263931274414
Come murmured Athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please	51.878517150878906
It was three oclock in the afternoon	100.96537017822266
The two travelers proceeded to the Rue Saint Dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of De Luynes	56.514068603515625
Tis here said Athos	139.5276641845703
He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the Duchess de Chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere	123.06207275390625
The servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere she would receive him	111.70445251464844
Athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door	33.46117401123047
Athos made a sign to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was	118.78392791748047
The footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere	103.85798645019531
Madame de Chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story The Three Musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman	65.85426330566406
Although about fortyfour or fortyfive years old she might have passed for thirtyfive	127.25833129882812
She still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	66.88350677490234
She had still her nymphlike form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with Anne of Austria over the moat of the Tuileries in 1563	92.34858703613281
In all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family	66.62675476074219
She was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	41.99895095825195
She held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion	399.5966491699219
At the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	20.684797286987305
Athos appeared	97.6062240600586
He was dressed in violettinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color	291.8675231933594
His shoulderknots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue Feron	359.41650390625
Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots	116.89786529541016
In his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that Madame de Chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	86.67928314208984
Athos bowed and obeyed	45.82586669921875
The footman was withdrawing but Athos stopped him by a sign	48.98450469970703
Madame he said to the duchess I have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me	34.263912200927734
I have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour	185.90113830566406
I grant it monsieur replied Madame de Chevreuse with her most gracious smile	112.1651382446289
But that is not all madame	67.40821075439453
Oh I am very presuming I am aware	144.94351196289062
The interview for which I ask is of us two alone and I very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted	48.232234954833984
I am not at home to any one said the Duchess de Chevreuse to the footman	154.57301330566406
You may go	76.35298919677734
The footman went out	13.659473419189453
There ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side	84.44041442871094
The duchess was the first to speak	20.15068817138672
Well sir I am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me	575.9363403320312
And I madame replied Athos am looking with admiration	103.6415023803711
Sir said Madame de Chevreuse you must excuse me but I long to know to whom I am talking	138.9241485595703
You belong to the court doubtless yet I have never seen you at court	3866.216796875
Have you by any chance been in the Bastile	132.67218017578125
No madame I have not but very likely I am on the road to it	22.221025466918945
Ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for I am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more	24.372859954833984
Who I am madame My name has been mentioned to youthe Comte de la Fere you do not know that name	75.05667877197266
I once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it	232.13531494140625
Tell it me sir	88.11346435546875
Formerly said the count I was Athos	168.2593994140625
Madame de Chevreuse looked astonished	26.081279754638672
The name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections	51.61160659790039
Athos said she wait a moment	101.09910583496094
And she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment	106.92847442626953
Shall I help you madame asked Athos	159.72024536132812
Yes do said the duchess	44.271366119384766
This Athos was connected with three young musketeers named Porthos DArtagnan and	47.987632751464844
He stopped short	99.24626159667969
And Aramis said the duchess quickly	8.538078308105469
And Aramis I see you have not forgotten the name	104.20240020751953
No she said poor Aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses	97.49676513671875
I am afraid he has turned out ill she added	53.368553161621094
He has he is an abb	6.5933051109313965
Ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	92.38395690917969
Indeed sir I thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth	40.373016357421875
Will you permit me then to recall another to you	106.34809112548828
Relating to him	135.3445281982422
Yes and no	33.896446228027344
Faith said Madame de Chevreuse say on	41.59961700439453
With a man like you I fear nothing	74.3768310546875
Athos bowed	73.35631561279297
Aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from Tours a cousin of his named Marie Michon	938.7351684570312
Ah I knew her cried the duchess	129.5166015625
It was to her he wrote from the siege of Rochelle to warn her of a plot against the Duke of Buckingham	175.44973754882812
Exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her	228.7339630126953
If replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her	244.4741973876953
I should be ungrateful said Athos and I regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse	454.7054748535156
You ungrateful to Marie Michon monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse trying to read in Athoss eyes	28.692665100097656
But how can that be You never knew her	325.9716491699219
Eh madame who knows said Athos	88.45828247070312
There is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth	53.42755126953125
Oh go on monsieur go on said Madame de Chevreuse eagerly you ca nt imagine how much this conversation interests me	121.85591125488281
You encourage me said Athos I will continue then	49.28889846801758
That cousin of Aramis that Marie Michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queenproud as she is in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniardcalled her her sister	235.4822540283203
Alas said Madame de Chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed	100.8174819946289
And the queen had reason for her affection for Marie was devoted to herdevoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother the king of Spain	577.8197631835938
Which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime	104.43539428710938
And therefore continued Athos the cardinalthe true cardinal the other onedetermined one fine morning to arrest poor Marie Michon and send her to the Chateau de Loches	28.044424057006836
Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen	62.104888916015625
The case had been provided for if Marie Michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayerbook bound in green velvet	72.13512420654297
That is true monsieur you are well informed	52.80417251586914
One morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de Marsillac	146.8943634033203
There was no time to lose	355.9464111328125
Happily Marie and a follower of hers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	153.3698272705078
The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for Kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from Tours shaping their course toward Spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn	89.8065414428711
Why really it was all exactly as you say cried Madame de Chevreuse clapping her hands	130.16867065429688
It would indeed be strange if she checked herself	74.59950256347656
If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said Athos	82.1311264038086
No madame I will not thus waste your time	46.5821647644043
We will accompany them only to a little village in Limousin lying between Tulle and Angoulemea little village called RochelAbeille	18.406021118164062
Madame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at Athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile	62.437095642089844
Wait madame continued Athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what I have narrated	84.89302062988281
Monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse I believe you are a sorcerer I am prepared for anything	88.29228973388672
But reallyNo matter go on	46.49009704589844
The journey of that day had been long and wearing it was a cold day the eleventh of October there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive	40.89130783081055
Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest	91.87427520751953
Athos paused	40.614139556884766
Oh continue said the duchess	58.043373107910156
I have told you that I am prepared for anything	70.4274673461914
The two travelers knocked at the door	97.35469818115234
It was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	62.323795318603516
They entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	48.07600784301758
A lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest	152.7496795654297
Marie Michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality	176.0525665283203
Willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber	66.21685028076172
The two travelers consulted for a moment	39.67504119873047
The priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied Thank you monsieur le cur I accept	11.957723617553711
Sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for I too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight	132.2620391845703
Madame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction	96.45379638671875
Her face as she looked at Athos had taken on an expression that can not be described	81.5858383178711
It could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companions words	132.30809020996094
What happened then she asked	47.4681396484375
Then said Athos	97.74235534667969
Ah I have come now to what is most difficult	24.59777069091797
Speak speak One can say anything to me	59.79296875
Besides it does nt concern me it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon	145.22743225097656
Ah that is true said Athos	167.17727661132812
Well then Marie Michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host Kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper	47.93922424316406
Really monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse unless you are the devil in person I do nt know how you could become acquainted with all these details	85.38160705566406
A charming woman was that Marie Michon resumed Athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas	60.44530487060547
Now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abb	175.37998962402344
Count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me	243.00860595703125
Alas continued Athos the poor abb was not a St	38.758766174316406
Ambroise and I repeat Marie Michon was an adorable creature	41.681304931640625
Monsieur cried the duchess seizing Athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or I will send to the convent of the Vieux Augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you	37.91183090209961
Athos laughed	88.11866760253906
Nothing is easier madame	66.74234008789062
A cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the cur summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night	146.44430541992188
The priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	110.24671173095703
And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abb and not from the good abb himself	48.7016716003418
And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came	89.91627502441406
It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse	5.56544828414917
The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter	59.62757110595703
Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she expected	161.3575897216797
Sit down dear count and go on with your story	20.157468795776367
At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault madame	43.5123405456543
I have told you that I was traveling on an important mission	62.28752136230469
At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep	62.555728912353516
In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress	113.3083724975586
Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with her	108.56782531738281
In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was	2.000459671020508
Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse hastily	40.55696487426758
Marie Michon continued Athos	69.0289306640625
Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready	358.9554443359375
We set forth on our journey	84.1883773803711
And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevreuse	33.77761459350586
A year after madame	200.4571533203125
I wanted to see the good cur again	60.51913833618164
I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend	111.90955352783203
A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 October 1633	116.37928771972656
It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevreuse	204.8629913330078
Yes but he could nt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his return	83.45621490478516
You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her	146.14385986328125
And what said the abb asked Athos	79.92686462402344
That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away	77.73316955566406
That was true	58.69356155395508
Ah I see That nobleman was you it was his father	62.9622688293457
Hush do not speak so loud madame he is there	8.228800773620605
He is there my son the son of Marie Michon But I must see him instantly	159.0772247314453
Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother	123.68247985839844
You have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	430.88623046875
Oh thanks sir thanks cried Madame de Chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble heart	64.32666778564453
I bring him to you madame said Athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him till now I have watched over his education and I have made him I hope an accomplished gentleman but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction	45.841217041015625
Tomorrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be killed	350.5927734375
Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place	31.371265411376953
Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I can	15.91292667388916
I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be his	43.92878723144531
As to his title and fortune	20.902671813964844
As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte	68.7442398071289
Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicomte	324.7410583496094
Where is he	109.9726333618164
There in the salon	355.1990051269531
I will have him come in if you really wish it	141.55154418945312
Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	66.1512680053711
Is he handsome she asked	89.01045227050781
Athos smiled	171.16690063476562
He resembles his mother	53.66415023803711
So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in	226.52220153808594
The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	57.75440216064453
Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand	102.92472839355469
The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse	101.57477569580078
Sir he said turning to Athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess de Chevreuse and is she not the queen	201.17764282226562
No vicomte said Madame de Chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily I am not the queen	59.712276458740234
If I were I should do for you at once the most that you deserve	125.91907501220703
But let us see whatever I may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow	45.021854400634766
Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure	315.7020568847656
Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the army	118.4390869140625
I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince	768.6539916992188
Yes I understand it well	11.435189247131348
Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my motherinlaw and Madame de Longueville	45.07728576660156
But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed that s the right thing	274.2542419433594
The Prince de Marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately	48.8729248046875
Well that will do charmingly said the count but may I beg that the greatest haste may be made for I have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than tomorrow night in Paris	366.4183654785156
Do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte	35.652828216552734
Better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me	107.1602554321289
Oh sir cried Raoul	65.06571960449219
You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without reflection	129.31729125976562
Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just now	296.2693176269531
What are you going to do this evening	530.3241577148438
We intend to visit the Abb Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my friends	94.43660736083984
Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen me	131.51028442382812
Athos bowed and prepared to leave	105.35336303710938
Well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends	55.243446350097656
Ah murmured Athos kissing her hand had I only sooner known that Marie Michon was so charming a creature And he withdrew sighing	52.68442916870117
Chapter XXI	96.30553436279297
The Abb Scarron	207.12164306640625
There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man	109.67053985595703
There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	133.11614990234375
Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went there	126.1479263305664
It was the abode of the little Abb Scarron	99.99446868896484
In the home of the witty abb dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others	175.18951416015625
The diminutive Abb Scarron who however was an abb only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he inhabited	223.58592224121094
On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	47.4681396484375
He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine	143.64915466308594
He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume	95.03765106201172
At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles	182.01779174804688
As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold	27.329362869262695
Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled	345.00958251953125
Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs	51.960079193115234
He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	141.7998046875
There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title	120.93444061279297
Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scarron	38.177024841308594
And what is that	116.83065795898438
That of being your invalid answered Scarron	66.41059112548828
So he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs	47.66090393066406
From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal	34.26487350463867
One day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often	91.13130950927734
And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth	30.880708694458008
He has unfortunately too much wit	123.96990966796875
Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man	30.406644821166992
Because he is an enemy	138.4212646484375
Of whom	107.86270141601562
Of the cardinal	40.96318054199219
What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man	102.34078979492188
The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently	167.48158264160156
Now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarterday payment and Scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pensionoffice but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron	64.7380142211914
It was on Thursday the abbs reception day people went there in crowds	15.446009635925293
The cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence	71.11857604980469
In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was	143.4582977294922
One of them hat in hand said to him	69.72821044921875
Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarrons pension	186.88690185546875
That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	348.723876953125
And they separated with courteous gestures	89.57682800292969
It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man	93.82245635986328
What then is this Monsieur Scarron who thus puts all Paris in commotion Is he some minister out of office	41.653438568115234
Oh no not at all vicomte Athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him	51.49065399169922
Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was derogatory	253.97293090820312
So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases famewitness Monsieur de Rotrou	307.1108093261719
Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make them	200.01747131347656
Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet	207.40945434570312
Yes you are warned vicomte	99.76301574707031
Consider well what you do in that house	111.79845428466797
Talk only by gestures or rather always listen	40.146305084228516
Yes monsieur replied Raoul	36.548431396484375
You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abb dHerblay of whom you have often heard me speak	270.6712341308594
I remember him monsieur	56.033111572265625
Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	100.09093475341797
That little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers	74.0236587524414
Very well monsieur I will obey you at all points	24.313718795776367
Athos made two visits in Paris at seven oclock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	203.6369171142578
Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	11.595645904541016
The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	48.39266586303711
This was the Abb Scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small switch	30.356250762939453
Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies	29.126728057861328
The room was neatly comfortably furnished	58.68622589111328
Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	20.306867599487305
Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company	23.11880111694336
On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to Scarron	148.0414581298828
Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit	87.37445831298828
After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Paulet	154.70367431640625
Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	61.97188949584961
Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry IV	309.9003601074219
was going when he was assassinated	40.365440368652344
Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the fashion	36.82565689086914
She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens with	458.8599853515625
This fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lionne	69.3739242553711
Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Raoul	69.22872161865234
Athos smiled	66.34127807617188
Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her do nt try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of Henry IV	90.30970001220703
When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aramis	153.6237335205078
Presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked	29.051637649536133
At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor	18.235702514648438
At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name	54.41322708129883
Athos did the same	32.024295806884766
He knew the Abb de Gondy only by report	2202.851318359375
He saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everythingexcept drawing a sword and firing a pistolwith something haughty and contemptuous in his face	159.29522705078125
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair	124.60260772705078
Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abb	166.40509033203125
This was the orthodox phrase	31.733129501342773
It had been said that evening a hundred timesand Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him	36.79023742675781
Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	326.8016357421875
But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre Dame	79.74220275878906
Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too much	18.4970703125
Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant	31.590639114379883
I shall borrow from the queen	83.02005004882812
But her majesty has no property interposed Aramis	96.16512298583984
At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced	58.09828567504883
Every one arose	23.449581146240234
Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window	126.75053405761719
In the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out Raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived Athos and became thoughtful she saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan	120.0891342163086
Apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor Voiture do you know Scarron	70.51856994628906
What is Monsieur Voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to Athos in the Rue Saint Honore what is the matter with him	22.885868072509766
He was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die	83.41913604736328
Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window curtain	64.20651245117188
Die cried Mademoiselle Paulet bitterly he Why he is surrounded by sultanas like a Turk	53.89999771118164
Madame de Saintot has hastened to him with broth La Renaudot warms his sheets the Marquise de Rambouillet sends him his tisanes	53.767616271972656
You do nt like him my dear Parthenie said Scarron	157.49195861816406
What an injustice my dear invalid I hate him so little that I should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul	61.84722137451172
You are not called Lionne for nothing observed Madame de Chevreuse your teeth are terrible	112.099853515625
You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to say	115.41069793701172
A great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him	71.46930694580078
A great poet he is scarcely five feet high	71.99526977539062
Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right place	46.27921676635742
For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about poetry	29.512638092041016
Who is this officer inquired Raoul of Athos who is speaking	104.70650482177734
Monsieur de Scudery the author of Clelie and of Le Grand Cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near Monsieur Scarron	160.30853271484375
Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived	423.9871520996094
One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals	162.43194580078125
The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	57.51061248779297
Raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little Louise whom he had left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten	63.02793502807617
Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear	618.4654541015625
Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise	51.63799285888672
Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at us	46.53642272949219
And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group	401.4991455078125
Aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room	52.305416107177734
As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation	571.58837890625
Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do	21.479215621948242
Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur labb is repeating to me	38.70794677734375
said Athos in a loud voice and I confess I think it incomparable	38.35081100463867
Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevreuse	70.54425811767578
Well then asked Athos in a low tone	27.392385482788086
It is to be tomorrow said Aramis hastily	396.3170166015625
At what time	46.21567153930664
Six oclock	93.30648040771484
At Saint Mande	185.07794189453125
Who told you	281.4563903808594
The Count de Rochefort	46.854007720947266
Some one drew near	382.5821228027344
And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voitures works but I am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet	2.000459671020508
Aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	7.418789863586426
And I too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes	164.8849639892578
I have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly	120.5350112915039
Monsieur Scarron do me the honor said Raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company	71.56212615966797
Ah my young vicomte replied Scarron I suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive	65.60496520996094
Raoul blushed again	84.47097778320312
You asked the name of that young lady	33.24642562866211
She is called the fair Indian	61.38722610473633
Excuse me sir returned Raoul blushing still more deeply I know no more than I did before	105.75037384033203
Alas I am from the country	60.76793670654297
Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets	125.91938018798828
So much the better young man so much the better Do nt try to understand ityou will only lose your time	65.75018310546875
You forgive me then sir said Raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young Indian	289.82940673828125
Certainly one of the most charming persons that livesMademoiselle Frances dAubigne	74.55138397216797
Does she belong to the family of the celebrated Agrippa the friend of Henry IV	162.53466796875
His granddaughter	33.548099517822266
She comes from Martinique so I call her the beautiful Indian	126.66600036621094
Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled	38.103397369384766
The company went on speaking of the poet Voiture	113.5909194946289
Monsieur said Mademoiselle dAubigne to Scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with Raoul do you not admire Monsieur Voitures friends Listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixthbut good heavens what will they leave him as Mademoiselle de Scudery remarks	12.112747192382812
Scarron and Raoul laughed	26.662578582763672
The fair Indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of naivete	118.46015930175781
Athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	54.892765045166016
Tell the Comte de la Fere to come to me said Madame de Chevreuse I want to speak to him	47.4681396484375
And I said the coadjutor want it to be thought that I do not speak to him	54.10573959350586
I admire I love himfor I know his former adventuresbut I shall not speak to him until the day after tomorrow	1014.1879272460938
And why day after tomorrow asked Madame de Chevreuse	124.17916107177734
You will know that tomorrow evening said the coadjutor smiling	68.01822662353516
Really my dear Gondy said the duchess you remind one of the Apocalypse	71.73592376708984
Monsieur dHerblay she added turning toward Aramis will you be my servant once more this evening	44.59464645385742
How can you doubt it replied Aramis this evening tomorrow always command me	75.29750061035156
I will then	57.33220291137695
Go and look for the Comte de la Fere I wish to speak with him	41.88501739501953
Aramis found Athos and brought him	75.3702392578125
Monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what I promised you our young friend will be extremely well received	77.3334732055664
Madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you	30.412559509277344
You have no reason to envy him on that score for I owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled Marie Michon to Aramis and to Athos	293.4368896484375
As she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage	109.0787353515625
Mademoiselle Paulet had already gone Mademoiselle de Scudery was going	15.543100357055664
Vicomte said Athos to Raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend	88.41062927246094
The fair Indian approached Scarron	67.2279052734375
You are going already he said	31.35287857055664
One of the last as you see if you hear anything of Monsieur Voiture be so kind as to send me word tomorrow	27.787212371826172
Oh said Scarron he may die now	93.4562759399414
Why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes	118.19074249267578
Certainly his panegyric has been uttered	572.8184204101562
They parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love	102.5256576538086
One by one the several groups broke up	18.480134963989258
Scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation	69.51415252685547
What was all that to Scarron At his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queens invalid	46.01951599121094
As to Raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying	143.99623107910156
Vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune	163.9619140625
Then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the Hotel de Luynes	181.26296997070312
The carriage had started Madame de Chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and Raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction	105.52590942382812
Athos surmised what had taken place and smiled	139.76998901367188
Come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	471.91204833984375
Sleep well your last night as citizen	90.70103454589844
I am to be a soldier then said the young man	141.15480041503906
Oh monsieur I thank you with all my heart	72.3263168334961
Adieu count said the Abb dHerblay I return to my convent	908.5973510742188
Adieu abb said the coadjutor I am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening	318.4261474609375
Adieu gentlemen said the count I am going to sleep twentyfour hours I am just falling down with fatigue	83.28630828857422
The three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	13.472140312194824
Scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye	183.862060546875
Not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension They can move their arms they can and that is much	347.43011474609375
Alas I have only my tongue but I will try to show that it is good for something	74.74826049804688
Ho there Champenois here it is eleven oclock	279.35345458984375
Come and roll me to bed	190.48568725585938
Really that Demoiselle dAubigne is very charming	245.43338012695312
So the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleepingroom and one by one the lights in the salon of the Rue des Tournelles were extinguished	148.90176391601562
Chapter XXII	172.9591064453125
Saint Denis	408.80487060546875
The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself	34.821475982666016
It was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping	65.04592895507812
Contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute	70.17618560791016
He was occupied with the preparations for Raouls departure and was seeking to gain time	48.227325439453125
In the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	193.3612518310547
Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called Olivain the lackey who had followed him from Blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign	55.81487274169922
At length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	135.926025390625
The sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening	47.31769943237305
He was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	41.58869171142578
Athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection	264.9061584472656
By degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh	8.61997127532959
His own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	59.01657485961914
Between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss	70.01771545410156
But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	106.87113189697266
He remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul	393.7661437988281
In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man	58.91684341430664
At this moment Raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	40.5291748046875
You are there sir he said respectfully	133.2845916748047
Yes Raoul replied the count	90.62451934814453
And you did not awaken me	51.87724304199219
I wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday	106.14913940429688
Oh sir how good you are	53.88451385498047
Athos smiled	156.416259765625
How do you feel this morning he inquired	357.2579345703125
Perfectly well quite rested sir	337.97900390625
You are still growing Athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth	206.88821411132812
Oh sir I beg your pardon exclaimed Raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant I shall be dressed	261.42584228515625
Athos then called Olivain	452.8033752441406
Everything said Olivain to Athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting	194.42689514160156
And I was asleep cried Raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details	243.00245666503906
Truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits	255.90383911132812
Therefore you love me a little I hope replied Athos in a tone of emotion	164.66990661621094
Oh sir God knows how much I love revere you	164.19679260253906
See that you forget nothing said Athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion	2114.697998046875
No indeed sir answered Raoul	219.09886169433594
The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly	103.56932067871094
Monsieur le vicomte has no sword	294.75006103515625
Tis well said Athos I will take care of that	47.4681396484375
They went downstairs Raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but Athos was silent	30.334331512451172
When they reached the steps Raoul saw three horses	128.8824920654297
Oh sir then you are going with me	68.54153442382812
I will accompany you a portion of the way said Athos	84.22334289550781
Joy shone in Raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	101.65453338623047
Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms	179.70687866210938
Raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay	78.46778106689453
They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called LAbreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chatelet	40.70083999633789
They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis	105.45684814453125
After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raouls way of riding and observed	618.54443359375
Take care Raoul I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider	148.53089904785156
See your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable	207.8419952392578
You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	154.93629455566406
The safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse	410.88934326171875
In a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle	159.0974884033203
Then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation	147.40298461914062
See Raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting	66.8205795288086
The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed	14.707808494567871
I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched	127.4237289428711
This tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	237.70846557617188
So in twelve times you thrice missed the mark	40.891014099121094
Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul smiling	111.09893798828125
Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what I mean	101.01641082763672
Yes sir	69.88059997558594
I have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful	38.401641845703125
What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry blast	2.000459671020508
Apropos if you fireand you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powderremember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot	26.339006423950195
He who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times	117.9613037109375
I shall do so if only in gratitude	378.7503356933594
Eh cried Athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder They are	140.56488037109375
Then another important thing Raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	46.973960876464844
At all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me	98.24939727783203
We are judges of wounds we old soldiers Athos added smiling	127.11398315429688
Thank you sir answered the young man much moved	21.93474769592285
They arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	86.02336883544922
Here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army	87.1535415649414
How do you make that out inquired Athos	77.35832977294922
By his manner sir and his age he s the second today	80.67536926269531
Has a young man such as I am gone through this morning then asked Raoul	125.9855728149414
Faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have	90.94685363769531
He will be my companion on the journey sir cried Raoul	200.16505432128906
Alas he can not make me forget what I shall have lost	81.2080307006836
Thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on	86.81243896484375
Let us alight Raoul said Athos	228.37811279296875
Olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword	79.89985656738281
The two gentlemen then went into the church	232.85281372070312
Athos gave Raoul some of the holy water	129.92063903808594
A love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	81.78374481201172
Athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement	96.83578491210938
Come Raoul he said let us follow this man	48.66426086425781
The verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst Athos and Raoul descended	46.957969665527344
The sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleursdelis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak	172.84031677246094
The young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne Dust of the earth Here I await thee	82.08641052246094
There was profound silence	261.1769104003906
Then Athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin	60.1500244140625
This temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it	69.92549133300781
He whose intellect was thus supreme Raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	47.313785552978516
Remember Raoul this If Richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great	74.09785461425781
The Palace of the Louvre contains two thingsthe king who must die and royalty which never dies	223.42169189453125
The minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing after him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be destroyed	133.4864044189453
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinals death as a deliverance and I even I opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand	124.76390838623047
Raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of God	114.42681121826172
Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything	57.981441497802734
Raoul I seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud	127.3238754272461
It will be happier I think than ours has been	65.65882873535156
Different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect	73.2197494506836
Should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that Divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that wegentlemen nevertheless of rank and conditionare as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended	122.82909393310547
I shall adore God sir said Raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king	141.84518432617188
And if death be my lot I hope to die for the king for royalty and for God	73.38130187988281
Have I sir comprehended your instructions	103.10376739501953
Athos smiled	61.263301849365234
Yours is a noble nature	25.616527557373047
he said here is your sword	74.44111633300781
Raoul bent his knee to the ground	103.83402252197266
It was worn by my father a loyal gentleman	42.3852424621582
I have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side	119.16845703125
Should your hand still be too weak to use this sword Raoul so much the better	150.9688720703125
You will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used	525.7943725585938
Sir replied Raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count I owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me	82.76388549804688
I will wear it I swear to you as a grateful man should do	28.162437438964844
Tis well arise vicomte embrace me	60.71652603149414
Raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the counts arms	134.9173126220703
Adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me	116.52371978759766
Oh for ever and ever cried the youth oh I swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that I shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought	80.03228759765625
Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses	56.05176544189453
Olivain said Athos showing the servant Raouls shoulderbelt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low	73.02842712402344
You will accompany monsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you	65.62295532226562
You know Raoul Grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you	55.65177917480469
Yes sir answered Raoul	249.84451293945312
Now to horse that I may see you depart	60.54999542236328
Raoul obeyed	40.47536849975586
Adieu Raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy	37.7137565612793
Adieu sir adieu my beloved protector	30.94637107849121
Athos waved his handhe dared not trust himself to speak and Raoul went away his head uncovered	49.28703308105469
Athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street	385.76959228515625
Then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray	444.9266662597656
Chapter XXIII	112.42353820800781
One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort	46.60708236694336
Meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly	128.07168579101562
Unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the Duc de Beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	82.00762176513672
In his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart	106.11001586914062
In the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him	115.90849304199219
It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	56.353309631347656
It may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the master	92.04936981201172
Then Monsieur de Beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the Palais Royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria Monsieur de Beaufort has escaped Whilst saying that to himself Monsieur de Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice I am free	30.17568016052246
It is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the antechamber	77.78084564208984
The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope	62.8322868347168
Grimaud seemed to him an Antinous	66.73304748535156
It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	45.05166244506836
Grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior La Ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said La Ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort	234.0139923095703
And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner	84.28192138671875
He had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent	22.065101623535156
Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Macon	107.30419921875
All this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so goodnatured who invented so droll tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin made for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year	57.268898010253906
He therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	85.88790893554688
Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marteau	157.1111297607422
The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beauforts coatofarms	26.039011001586914
It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it	108.69463348388672
La Ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his hands	27.64858055114746
To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputygovernor of the chateau	239.82337951660156
As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	35.92100524902344
In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert	128.11138916015625
Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening	80.02816772460938
The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	182.21701049804688
There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key	158.80810546875
When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside	67.78933715820312
It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached	72.01995086669922
This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Ramee	125.59945678710938
The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon	74.78752136230469
The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely	167.90089416503906
Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls	73.02842712402344
When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other comrades	59.243438720703125
The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone	16.411518096923828
Six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served up	391.51361083984375
Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	71.87791442871094
The rest of the dinner was to come	167.16221618652344
Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	85.6926498413086
Grimaud alone was calm as ever	75.73146057128906
One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event	3604.163818359375
There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	181.33273315429688
La Ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the dukes health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified	155.50621032714844
Whenever my lord pleases	1140.2940673828125
The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast six	391.2682189941406
The escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to wait	47.114261627197266
The duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter	65.8391342163086
La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner	30.718929290771484
It was Caesars Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions	267.7958068847656
Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good	246.35850524902344
At halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely	134.05313110351562
Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient times	189.5033416748047
You think so my lord answered La Ramee	523.1419677734375
Well as for me I prefer Hannibal	64.0142822265625
And why pray Master La Ramee asked the duke	63.928871154785156
Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse laugh	59.139686584472656
The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself opposite	60.471336364746094
There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss	42.099117279052734
The duke smiled	119.42420959472656
Zounds he said I do nt suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself	95.5531234741211
You are right my lord duke answered the officer I do nt know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV	30.648496627807617
you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys	173.2537841796875
The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Ramee	62.40943908691406
My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments	139.2054901123047
No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you	64.91380310058594
Then you are attached to me asked the duke	85.53099060058594
To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vincennes	391.36187744140625
A droll way of showing your affliction	27.58047866821289
The duke meant to say affection	8.97111701965332
But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vincennes	27.84075927734375
Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably worse	54.83437728881836
Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness	76.42317962646484
But what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of Cardinal Richelieu Ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table	18.306171417236328
In short answered the duke if I comprehend you aright La Ramee I am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place	1103.0650634765625
Oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it	694.2028198242188
Yes returned the duke I must confess I sometimes think of it	104.86589050292969
Still by one of your forty methods your highness	1585.2808837890625
Yes yes indeed	80.23843383789062
My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness	83.07192993164062
Willingly answered the duke give me the pie	298.3460693359375
I am listening said La Ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of Madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	116.66887664794922
The duke glanced at the clock	34.75839614868164
In ten minutes it would strike seven	77.72637939453125
Grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust but La Ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke	154.1536102294922
Thank you La Ramee said the prisoner	66.25171661376953
Well my lord this famous invention of yours	30.425527572631836
Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first	81.2121353149414
Yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	86.9364242553711
Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you	83.11566925048828
And you have me my lord	12.802863121032715
Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight	207.37652587890625
Come come said La Ramee that s not a bad idea	55.65342330932617
Capital is nt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to be	32.141448974609375
Hush do nt let us talk politics my lord	59.37550735473633
Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison walls	96.09915924072266
Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you	246.55181884765625
Nothing easier in a game of tennis for example	263.3962097167969
In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes words	38.929359436035156
Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a letter	227.25466918945312
Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter	38.512481689453125
Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it	268.4168701171875
The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord	151.3461151123047
I shall have to watch the men who pick up balls	15.732245445251465
The duke smiled	27.13799476623535
But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of corresponding	184.7725830078125
And that is a great deal it seems to me	144.9911346435547
But not enough	5.249363422393799
Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses	178.3048095703125
Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you	54.228675842285156
That s not needed	56.5577392578125
I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts	189.54310607910156
A rope ladder	53.297664642333984
Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes ca nt be sent around a ball like a letter	100.94779968261719
No but it may be sent in something else	22.060718536376953
In something elsein something else In what	179.8902587890625
In a pate for example	65.6589584350586
In a pate said La Ramee	139.68777465820312
Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre dhotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau	101.42962646484375
Well said La Ramee shuddering	22.435853958129883
Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try them	154.4699249267578
I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with me	290.1816101074219
That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on us	79.57264709472656
Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	52.21207809448242
The moment for my escape is fixedseven oclock	109.4951171875
Well at a few minutes to seven	40.31951141357422
At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his brow	244.51197814941406
At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	31.166709899902344
I point one of the poniards at La Ramees breast and I say to him My friend I am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man	240.9330291748047
The duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words	2.000459671020508
He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination	83.09332275390625
Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	73.85730743408203
La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing	84.19596099853516
Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you have nt the heart to kill me	22.565994262695312
No not if thou dost not oppose my flight	97.74254608154297
But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined man	31.415672302246094
I will compensate thee for the loss of thy place	60.877105712890625
You are determined to leave the chateau	28.189273834228516
By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be free	58.07377624511719
And if I defend myself or call or cry out	60.890602111816406
I will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman	64.16026306152344
At this moment the clock struck	204.25474548339844
Seven oclock said Grimaud who had not spoken a word	175.59445190429688
La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience	163.05810546875
The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart	32.33184051513672
Let us dispatch said the duke	92.10086822509766
My lord one last favor	63.66132736206055
What speak make haste	13.870183944702148
Bind my arms my lord fast	420.6703796386719
Why bind thee	158.10202026367188
That I may not be considered as your accomplice	122.2816390991211
Your hands asked Grimaud	353.7774658203125
Not before me behind me	145.2500762939453
But with what asked the duke	72.65312957763672
With your belt my lord replied La Ramee	133.80650329589844
The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy him	33.84775924682617
Your feet too said Grimaud	301.3507385253906
La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramees feet together	60.42884826660156
Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangoisse	260.19091796875
I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the alarm	24.921934127807617
Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in	2499.640380859375
Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say	138.89407348632812
Speak said the duke	17.07509422302246
Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four children	87.67427062988281
Rest assured put the gag in Grimaud	257.77789306640625
In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	122.958251953125
Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle	199.52993774414062
Grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and doublelocked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure	97.06526947021484
At last they reached the tennis court	48.85694122314453
It was completely deserted	182.72836303710938
No sentinels no one at any of the windows	36.81847381591797
The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses	69.86973571777344
The duke exchanged a signal with them	81.43409729003906
It was indeed for him that they were there	77.51832580566406
Grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	56.47657012939453
This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board	103.19988250732422
Go said the duke	282.28607177734375
First my lord inquired Grimaud	23.294992446899414
If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to prison	65.3591079711914
If they catch thee thou wilt be hung	227.9358673095703
True replied Grimaud	150.8014373779297
And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	48.65180206298828
The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror	342.4090881347656
He had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke	339.682373046875
Grimaud fellprecipitated into the moat	355.5528564453125
The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single moan	339.4273681640625
He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell	68.54241943359375
Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to them	47.4681396484375
Descend my lord said the man in the moat	184.68836975097656
There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft	24.67884063720703
The duke had already begun to descend	124.64497375488281
His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him	34.51054000854492
He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	54.600440979003906
But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind	59.16907501220703
In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	36.50114059448242
He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him	30.253883361816406
He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	35.530250549316406
He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Rochefort	35.266109466552734
The other two gentlemen were unknown to him	113.93891906738281
Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	96.27625274658203
Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	42.28586959838867
On then on those who love me follow me	146.9694061279297
And he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe	21.211063385009766
Free free free	69.33631896972656
Chapter XXIV	219.08590698242188
The timely Arrival of DArtagnan in Paris	76.36231231689453
At Blois DArtagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal	15.128554344177246
From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but DArtagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis	295.10723876953125
In turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre in order to reach the Rue Tiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette where he had appointed Porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a skyblue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness	7.0217061042785645
DArtagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized them	25.42769432067871
Eh DArtagnan he cried	28.169750213623047
Thank God you have come	318.2071228027344
Eh goodday dear friend replied DArtagnan	40.61747360229492
Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	44.37675476074219
Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here	26.57379722595215
Indeed said DArtagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals	235.4280242919922
And I alsoI was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar selfcomplacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke I should have got a lodging elsewhere	218.35980224609375
The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthoss words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated	65.00971221923828
But to her great surprise DArtagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to Porthos	150.76980590820312
Yes I understand the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of Pierrefonds but console yourself I will soon conduct you to one much better	157.46273803710938
When will you do that	66.55255126953125
Immediately I hope	137.04299926757812
Ah so much the better	122.69895935058594
To that exclamation of Porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door	745.3745727539062
DArtagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose downdrawn mouth emitted sounds of distress	46.04262161254883
And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked DArtagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	303.9141845703125
He finds the cooking detestable replied Porthos	14.706405639648438
Why then does nt he attend to it himself as at Chantilly	44.11528396606445
Ah monsieur I have not here as I had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where I could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges	224.64593505859375
As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I found	80.60449981689453
Monsieur Mouston said DArtagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to	51.42273712158203
Then taking Porthos aside	95.8553695678711
My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the cardinals	57.24888229370117
Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering eyes	71.68942260742188
Yes my friend	131.22776794433594
A presentation indeed	44.53581619262695
Does that alarm you	152.3739471435547
No but it agitates me	54.376243591308594
Oh do nt be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	26.144977569580078
This one will not oppress you by his dignity	29.40083122253418
Tis the same thingyou understand me DArtagnana court	140.440673828125
There s no court now	56.514068603515625
The queen	30.774818420410156
I was going to say there s no longer a queen	50.33246994018555
The queen Rest assured we shall not see her	58.43532943725586
And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal	64.9765853881836
Only that there may be no delay I shall borrow one of your horses	74.04861450195312
Certainly all the four are at your service	17.864688873291016
Oh I need only one of them for the time being	26.585315704345703
Shall we take our valets	101.46072387695312
Yes you may as well take Mousqueton	106.97376251220703
As to Planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court	37.480812072753906
And what are they	24.189918518066406
Oh he does nt stand well with his eminence	39.73017883300781
Mouston said Porthos saddle Vulcan and Bayard	64.53998565673828
And for myself monsieur shall I saddle Rustaud	47.275020599365234
No take a more stylish horse Phoebus or Superbe we are going with some ceremony	45.18642807006836
Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit	32.848480224609375
Oh yes of course Mouston nothing else	56.687828063964844
But to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	95.44046783447266
You will find mine on my saddle already loaded	78.4867935180664
Mouston breathed a sigh he could nt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	44.53438186645508
Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right DArtagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine appearance	41.0482177734375
DArtagnan smiled	77.05516052246094
But you my friendare you not going to change your dress	13.573431015014648
No I shall go as I am	106.37745666503906
This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands	245.84239196777344
They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven	67.72178649902344
The streets were crowded for it was the day of Pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle	176.8509521484375
Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found two	2086.612548828125
On reaching the palace DArtagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay	27.5617618560791
He was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	67.66842651367188
Courage he whispered to Porthos as they proceeded	352.480712890625
Do not be intimidated	68.8049087524414
Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	8643.5576171875
We have only the vulture to deal with	144.47402954101562
Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of St	87.38011932373047
Gervais and do not bow too low to this Italian that might give him a poor idea of you	93.6690444946289
Good answered Porthos	63.71681213378906
Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number	86.27559661865234
He saw DArtagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance	243.42507934570312
Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt	34.81578063964844
Tis well	6.135635852813721
Welcome to ye	65.62042236328125
Thanks my lord	373.02099609375
Here I am at your eminences service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porthos	260.8014221191406
Porthos bowed to the cardinal	120.5306396484375
A magnificent cavalier remarked Mazarin	118.54434967041016
Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity	47.31349563598633
The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said DArtagnan	55.858642578125
Porthos bowed to his friend	61.831153869628906
Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to be	163.49676513671875
He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porthos	101.640869140625
He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone	139.99009704589844
He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons	299.52130126953125
And your two other friends he asked	23.738128662109375
Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn DArtagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	409.72930908203125
They are prevented at this moment but will join us later	40.39634323120117
Mazarin coughed a little	2.000459671020508
And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked	56.75067901611328
Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is rich	78.13838195800781
Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect	171.165283203125
Fifty thousand francs a year said Porthos	65.9173812866211
These were the first words he had spoken	96.48710632324219
From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then	60.88340377807617
My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said DArtagnan	38.543243408203125
Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands	429.3326416015625
I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain	103.0948257446289
And your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion	282.2841796875
Well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of Vallon at Corbeil that of Bracieux in the Soissonais and that of Pierrefonds in the Valois	90.67937469482422
Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony	214.5569305419922
Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that That can be managed	62.64635467529297
I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping forward	59.274349212646484
I told you so said DArtagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it	31.01299285888672
And you Monsieur DArtagnan what do you want	672.161376953125
My lord said DArtagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me lieutenant	308.85308837890625
Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you captain	50.777931213378906
DArtagnan bowed	816.6181030273438
Well that is not impossible	21.171125411987305
We will see gentlemen we will see	81.85127258300781
Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country	156.4828643798828
Porthos opened his mouth to reply	261.7522888183594
My lord said DArtagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible	227.77235412597656
That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into meditation	163.75323486328125
And yet he said I must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to quiet service I have certain apprehensionswell what is the meaning of that	125.98772430419922
In fact a great noise was heard in the antechamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming	55.1805534362793
My lord the cardinal my lord the cardinal	49.35456085205078
Mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors	40.2926139831543
DArtagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal	35.26020050048828
Well sir exclaimed Mazarin what s the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace	44.41221237182617
My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in secret	40.01548385620117
I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vincennes	40.337493896484375
Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that DArtagnan and Porthos should give place	155.0761260986328
DArtagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet	64.67677307128906
Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter	51.3365478515625
The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vincennes	35.083648681640625
Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news	149.24417114257812
He fell back almost fainting in his chair	66.1707992553711
Escaped Monsieur de Beaufort escaped	329.6142883300781
My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terrace	303.9584045410156
And you did not fire on him	161.82984924316406
He was out of range	127.53995513916016
Monsieur de Chavignywhere was he	75.56149291992188
And La Ramee	218.37811279296875
Was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him	83.32717895507812
But the man who was under him	47.427154541015625
Was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with him	265.775146484375
Mazarin groaned	88.31649780273438
My lord said DArtagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time	92.12748718261719
It may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	152.52630615234375
France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant	4.735716342926025
And who is to pursue him cried Mazarin	38.43653869628906
I pardieu	48.68476867675781
And you would arrest him	167.1276092529297
Why not	348.0188903808594
You would arrest the Duc de Beaufort armed in the field	130.67266845703125
If your eminence should order me to arrest the devil I would seize him by the horns and would bring him in	299.21954345703125
So would I said Porthos	74.40059661865234
So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	71.42733001708984
But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle	557.3960571289062
Very well said DArtagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos	29.437213897705078
Battle cried Porthos	59.41742706298828
And you think you can catch him	163.69146728515625
Yes if we are better mounted than he	56.95829391479492
Go then take what guards you find here and pursue him	60.657955169677734
You command us my lord to do so	23.086898803710938
And I sign my orders said Mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines Monsieur du Vallon your barony is on the back of the Duc de Beauforts horse you have nothing to do but to overtake it	87.79643249511719
As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish	187.11436462402344
To horse Porthos said DArtagnan taking his friend by the hand	4.216803550720215
Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime composure	4.629002094268799
They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the whirlwind	382.19482421875
Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gascon	128.4624481201172
Yes my captain	26.90996551513672
As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking	77.0393295288086
At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean DArtagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	34.15386962890625
The troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings	4.506396293640137
Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy	71.61257934570312
Chapter XXV	84.88917541503906
An Adventure on the High Road	70.41917419433594
The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village	339.0975341796875
The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces	200.2057342529297
DArtagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	648.3106689453125
From the top of an eminence DArtagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint Maur	47.97947692871094
He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive	78.08344268798828
In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	91.53887176513672
The several members of that group were much excited	59.25140380859375
They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground	190.75355529785156
Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures	4.735716342926025
On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	151.40061950683594
A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse	166.32608032226562
DArtagnan went straight to the sergeant	31.723642349243164
My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here	120.72114562988281
That prohibition is not for me said DArtagnan	378.01708984375
Have the fugitives been pursued	90.00605773925781
Yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted	141.8208465576172
How many are there	58.576045989990234
Four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded	403.3353271484375
Four said DArtagnan looking at Porthos	120.16284942626953
Do you hear baron They are only four	59.35914611816406
A joyous smile lighted Porthoss face	113.32847595214844
How long a start have they	65.07325744628906
Two hours and a quarter my officer	191.67161560058594
Two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos	95.98609161376953
Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses	139.3553924560547
Very good said DArtagnan and now in what direction did they set out	811.6266479492188
That I am forbidden to tell	85.30863952636719
DArtagnan drew from his pocket a paper	378.1470642089844
Order of the king he said	39.334320068359375
Speak to the governor then	34.81861114501953
And where is the governor	32.39893341064453
In the country	91.98078918457031
Anger mounted to DArtagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were colored	113.6880874633789
Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait	46.239906311035156
He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it	65.98097229003906
Order of the king I tell you	402.2829284667969
Read and answer or I will blow out your brains	165.04701232910156
The sergeant saw that DArtagnan was in earnest	88.82550811767578
The Vendomois road he replied	154.092529296875
And by what gate did they go out	27.856096267700195
By the Saint Maur gate	51.976619720458984
If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged tomorrow	118.13355255126953
And if you catch up with them you wo nt come back to hang me murmured the sergeant	554.8008422851562
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	109.32634735107422
This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	862.3005981445312
But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	98.04960632324219
It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes	104.39775085449219
This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell down	17.449989318847656
DArtagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it	105.274169921875
Porthos told him of it in his calm manner	32.347408294677734
If only we two arrive said DArtagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in number	86.31480407714844
That is true said Porthos	31.07623291015625
And he spurred his courser on	15.137642860412598
At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters	79.58265686035156
Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porthos	29.417938232421875
Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried DArtagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place	71.87044525146484
In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	3113.969482421875
They set out after a run of two leagues Mousquetons horse sank	190.0226593017578
Gracious me said Porthos there s Phoebus ruined	337.9296875
The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles	139.0646514892578
I m above that	62.92067337036133
Let us set out again at full gallop	86.28756713867188
Yes if we can	1563.765869140625
But at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall	38.54131317138672
The devil exclaimed Porthos there s Vulcan foundered	12482.1689453125
Zounds cried DArtagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porthos	769.8828125
What the devil are you doing	137.5261688232422
By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porthos	143.77894592285156
All three then cried Alls over	154.95166015625
Hush said DArtagnan	106.65995788574219
What is it	82.96986389160156
I hear a horse	34.08415603637695
It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us	193.47738647460938
No said DArtagnan it is in advance	100.86417388916016
That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by DArtagnan	158.28570556640625
Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and	132.39808654785156
Silence said Porthos	2.000459671020508
In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	37.25234603881836
It is five hundred feet from here in advance said DArtagnan	62.005699157714844
True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small huntinghouse	209.12551879882812
Mousqueton thy pistols said DArtagnan	131.58712768554688
I have them at hand monsieur	15.127631187438965
Porthos take yours from your holsters	43.53384017944336
I have them	99.01105499267578
Good said DArtagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos	53.896732330322266
Not too well	210.84190368652344
We are out on the kings service	56.2294921875
For the kings service we need horses	64.20550537109375
That is true said Porthos	226.89744567871094
Then not a word but set to work	41.021236419677734
They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	340.5553894042969
Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I do	150.12185668945312
They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses	132.71836853027344
A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles	112.0401611328125
DArtagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind	136.4707794189453
I buy those horses he said to the groom	3.918487548828125
The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	131.6720428466797
Did nt you hear fellow	10.35521125793457
Yes I heard	506.20806884765625
Why then did nt you reply	69.63256072998047
Because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	144.92774963378906
I take them then said the lieutenant	172.69911193847656
And he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing	719.8335571289062
Sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour	104.18450927734375
Half an hours rest is enough replied the Gascon	80.91268920898438
The groom cried aloud for help	234.0171356201172
A kind of steward appeared just as DArtagnan and his companions were prepared to mount	29.856523513793945
The steward attempted to expostulate	231.79420471191406
My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your brains	63.733619689941406
But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon	125.22372436523438
So much the better they must be good animals then	26.591604232788086
Sir I shall call my people	143.87522888183594
And I mine I ve ten guards behind me do nt you hear them gallop and I m one of the kings musketeers	431.752685546875
Come Porthos come Mousqueton	70.17444610595703
They all mounted the horses as quickly as possible	34.66154861450195
Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines	59.3199577331543
On on cried DArtagnan there ll be firing on	96.93885803222656
They all set off swift as the wind	72.7188491821289
Here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building	199.41236877441406
Take care of your horses cried DArtagnan to him	39.076568603515625
Fire replied the steward	165.94647216796875
A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air	141.42747497558594
They fire like grooms said Porthos	65.67530059814453
In the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to Crevecoeur Mousqueton	189.01998901367188
Ah sir my left side still pains me	58.578224182128906
Are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant	17.144933700561523
Egad did nt you hear these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon well Monsieur de Montbazon is the husband of Madame de Montbazon	135.1107177734375
And Madame de Montbazon is the mistress of the Duc de Beaufort	138.0822296142578
Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of horses	96.29672241210938
Exactly so	294.90496826171875
And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left	299.50830078125
My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said DArtagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction	288.4297790527344
Pooh replied Porthos I am what I am	308.6592102050781
They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust	195.46617126464844
Zounds what is yonder cried DArtagnan	135.48684692382812
You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porthos	28.244903564453125
Something bright	149.4914093017578
I too cried Mousqueton saw them also	48.54032897949219
Ah ah have we overtaken them	8.20578670501709
Good a dead horse said DArtagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours	62.33699035644531
I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horses mane	11.161358833312988
They appear to be numerous	60.76968002319336
Then tis something else	98.30512237548828
Another horse said Porthos	67.4360122680664
No dying	127.23478698730469
Yes saddled and bridled	35.485713958740234
Then we are upon the fugitives	120.68125915527344
Courage we have them	38.94646453857422
But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us	130.75450134277344
Nonsense cried DArtagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit they ll be afraid and will disperse	463.0100402832031
Certainly remarked Porthos	160.8184356689453
Ah do you see cried the lieutenant	120.7494125366211
The lights again this time I too saw them said Porthos	246.35638427734375
On on forward forward cried DArtagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes	25.173473358154297
And they darted on anew	97.31793975830078
The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon	101.44664764404297
Chapter XXVI	160.48123168945312
The Rencontre	197.6515655517578
They rode on in this way for ten minutes	639.450927734375
Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen	46.827518463134766
Aha cried DArtagnan they re coming toward us	140.2978973388672
So much the worse for them said Porthos	336.3375244140625
Who goes there cried a hoarse voice	67.18297576904297
The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	138.01263427734375
Bridle in mouth said DArtagnan	111.29681396484375
Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn	264.940673828125
Who goes there was asked a second time	208.0063018798828
Not a step forward or you re dead men	136.34564208984375
Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit	89.86441040039062
Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time	23.694814682006836
Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms	274.9396057128906
Back shouted DArtagnan or you are dead	86.07933044433594
Two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistolshot was heard aimed by DArtagnan and one of his adversaries fell	51.021793365478516
As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it	37.34926223754883
Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porthos	36.83457565307617
And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit	55.90205001831055
Well said Porthos	23.123559951782227
I ve broken my mans skull cried DArtagnan	90.69148254394531
And you	16.45520782470703
I ve only thrown the fellow down but hark	103.52597045898438
Another shot of a carbine was heard	105.630126953125
It was Mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	100.3616714477539
On on cried DArtagnan all goes well we have the first throw	23.254594802856445
Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players appear	84.10467529296875
And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the road	34.810829162597656
This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	48.698421478271484
Stand aside he cried stand off the road	79.6678237915039
What do you want asked a voice	37.05670166015625
The duke Porthos and DArtagnan roared out both at once	83.11023712158203
A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan	73.1868667602539
DArtagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	80.63894653320312
At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and DArtagnan turned to him	38.94300079345703
Bravo you ve killed him I think	101.89971160888672
No wounded his horse only	165.93301391601562
What would you have my dear fellow One does nt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the ring	33.621036529541016
Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse	47.415794372558594
Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his own	42.84123992919922
In truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die	114.58613586425781
He had received in the chest the bullet of DArtagnans first adversary	22.323348999023438
DArtagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	71.48995971679688
Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqueton	78.44207763671875
Zounds want one cried the Gascon	59.04562759399414
Heres one your honor	896.9069213867188
How the devil hast thou two horses asked DArtagnan jumping on one of them	51.85350036621094
Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took them	70.91722106933594
Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols	383.3638610839844
Be on the qui vive cried DArtagnan	71.06643676757812
Here are two other cavaliers	123.69161224365234
As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed	86.39189147949219
Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting up	243.223876953125
Why did nt thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porthos	86.46125030517578
I held the horses my hands were full your honor	111.19142150878906
A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with pain	2131.354736328125
Ah sir I m hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Amiens	44.8634147644043
Porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword but before it was out of the scabbard Porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butchers knife	42.644737243652344
Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle	92.14550018310547
On perceiving the cavaliers DArtagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the saddle	34.57752227783203
Here I am exclaimed Porthos	217.09962463378906
Shall we wait or shall we charge	138.08729553222656
Let us charge them answered the Gascon	61.93814468383789
Charge cried Porthos	381.14288330078125
They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them	52.64635467529297
For the king cried DArtagnan	82.30111694335938
The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust	45.218509674072266
Tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gascon	11.027017593383789
See answered the voice	241.8475341796875
Two shots were fired at once one by DArtagnan the other by the adversary of Porthos	284.3312072753906
DArtagnans ball took off his enemys hat	136.0565643310547
The ball fired by Porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning	124.09552764892578
For the last time where are you going	315.3914794921875
To the devil answered DArtagnan	165.4127197265625
Good you may be easy thenyoull get there	94.94338989257812
DArtagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters	258.3871765136719
He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse rear	357.3840026855469
The ball struck the animal full in front	20.010507583618164
DArtagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	93.67225646972656
Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	75.687744140625
To the sword sir the sword	60.992919921875
And he jumped off his horse	46.76716995239258
To the swords be it so replied DArtagnan that is exactly what I want	105.19673919677734
DArtagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	98.42805480957031
Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	92.41593933105469
DArtagnan returned and again attacked him	66.06600189208984
Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth	53.45679473876953
At last DArtagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing	49.420997619628906
He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible	128.05043029785156
The blow was parried	42.0932731628418
Sdeath he cried with his Gascon accent	143.5577392578125
At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant	27.138578414916992
As to DArtagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	6.443458080291748
Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent I ve still two pistols charged	91.6833724975586
The more reason you should fire the first cried his foe	38.76689147949219
Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle	87.70801544189453
As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	11.920883178710938
Athos exclaimed DArtagnan	72.16657257080078
DArtagnan ejaculated Athos	129.41746520996094
Athos raised his sword DArtagnan lowered his	37.78565979003906
Aramis cried Athos do nt fire	44.65510177612305
Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porthos	29.583629608154297
And he threw away his pistol	20.96360969543457
Aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his sword	40.15554428100586
My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to DArtagnan	64.24583435058594
This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	46.52081298828125
Athos cried DArtagnan wringing his hands	91.77239227294922
So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonoredand by you	215.6241912841797
Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death	44.92243576049805
Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way	2.000459671020508
What shall I say to the cardinal	125.14762878417969
You can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battlefield that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay and of surrendering only to fifty men	21.290205001831055
The prince exclaimed at the same moment Athos and Aramis unmasking as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort whilst DArtagnan and Porthos stepped backward	740.9517211914062
Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porthos	70.52515411376953
Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	122.42422485351562
The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen	20.010404586791992
Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two	59.38887405395508
Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Athos	314.9089660644531
Come gentlemen your swords said the duke	135.98255920410156
Our swords cried DArtagnan raising his head and regaining his selfpossession	37.476341247558594
Never added Porthos	138.769287109375
Some of the men moved toward them	47.39406967163086
One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low voice	26.742782592773438
As you will replied the duke	95.57176208496094
I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	499.59918212890625
Gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	225.8736572265625
Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are free	37.69300842285156
The order was obeyed DArtagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle	71.17882537841797
Now DHerblay said Athos dismount and come here	26.127647399902344
Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached DArtagnan	289.3996276855469
All four once more together	76.07940673828125
Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood	739.8074951171875
No replied DArtagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other	106.02600860595703
Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter	126.22212219238281
Oh Heaven No all is over said Porthos	6.245054244995117
Well be on our side now resumed Aramis	115.93148040771484
Silence DHerblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these	31.60429573059082
Tis a matter of conscience with them as with us	82.7924575805664
Meantime here we are enemies said Porthos	93.23270416259766
Gramercy who would ever have thought it	31.410938262939453
DArtagnan only sighed	234.10183715820312
Athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	132.3571319580078
Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through	58.59607696533203
Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable	78.99889373779297
For my own part I demand it said Aramis	35.57045364379883
I accept it interposed DArtagnan proudly	361.2947998046875
Porthos bowed as if in assent	30.91761016845703
Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other	112.9735107421875
Good the other three exclaimed	61.773712158203125
Well then the place	212.43243408203125
Will the Place Royale suit you asked DArtagnan	43.760101318359375
In Paris	176.46749877929688
Athos and Aramis looked at each other	26.124988555908203
The Place Royalebe it so replied Athos	151.2933807373047
Tomorrow evening if you like	126.65313720703125
At what hour	86.75851440429688
At ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned	95.19039916992188
There continued Athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained	198.48873901367188
Alas murmured DArtagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever	228.4821319580078
DArtagnan said Athos gravely I assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that	62.84199142456055
What I think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies	329.6405334472656
Yes he continued sadly shaking his head Yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us	171.17376708984375
Come Aramis	65.86418914794922
And we Porthos said DArtagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal	35.294593811035156
And tell him cried a voice that I am not too old yet for a man of action	11.043998718261719
DArtagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort	78.04320526123047
Can I do anything for you gentlemen asked the duke	106.23992919921875
Bear witness that we have done all that we could	159.6093292236328
That shall be testified to rest assured	14.376631736755371
Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your revenge	59.173194885253906
The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	22.594362258911133
DArtagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him	194.72109985351562
What do I see cried the lieutenant	12.820503234863281
Grimaud is it thou	27.166051864624023
Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken	73.36443328857422
And whose horses are these cried DArtagnan	96.12468719482422
Who has given them to us said Porthos	150.26380920410156
The Comte de la Fere	252.38922119140625
Athos Athos muttered DArtagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman Whither art thou going Grimaud	119.7669448852539
To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders your honor	86.18846130371094
They were taking the road toward Paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention	27.964197158813477
What is that asked DArtagnan	202.6354522705078
It is IMousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road	23.41595458984375
Porthos ran to him	69.66002655029297
Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he said	149.7460174560547
No sir but I am severely	38.51711654663086
What can we do said DArtagnan we must return to Paris	13.622007369995117
I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again	66.16694641113281
DArtagnan and Porthos went on meantime to Paris	231.3251495361328
They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of DArtagnan and Porthos	297.3389892578125
Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him	210.06959533691406
What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase DArtagnan has done me one good turnhe has destroyed Broussel	19.556703567504883
This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use	64.33930969238281
The cardinal referred to that man whom DArtagnan upset at the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris and who was no other than the Councillor Broussel	107.17738342285156
Chapter XXVII	151.0349578857422
The four old Friends prepare to meet again	144.9420623779297
Well said Porthos seated in the courtyard of the Hotel de la Chevrette to DArtagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the Palais Royal did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend	109.91475677490234
Ifaith yes a brute that cardinal	141.38890075683594
What are you eating there Porthos	57.19363021850586
I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine do the same	107.7814712524414
You are right	50.49030303955078
Gimblou a glass of wine	44.675811767578125
Well how has all gone off	49.561012268066406
Zounds you know there s only one way of saying things so I went in and said My lord we were not the strongest party	58.903499603271484
Yes I know that he said but give me the particulars	58.86469650268555
You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty and we were two	176.10325622558594
There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day I presume	32.99018478393555
That is the night my lord I answered	349.5813293457031
Ah cried the cardinal I thought you were a Gascon my friend	105.27577209472656
I am a Gascon said I only when I succeed	159.88491821289062
The answer pleased him and he laughed	96.21420288085938
That will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive	54.07306671142578
Well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porthos	346.77618408203125
Oh mon Dieu no nothing at all	53.74813461303711
It was the way in which he spoke	86.99559020996094
It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges Gimblou another bottle	124.49385833740234
The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration DArtagnan enjoyed in the establishment	58.742027282714844
He continued	34.71253204345703
So I was going away but he called me back	48.67518997192383
You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me	237.02032470703125
Yes my lord	44.465431213378906
How much were they worth	110.87264251708984
Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to me	202.2059326171875
A thousand pistoles I said	111.05947875976562
A thousand pistoles Porthos exclaimed	135.28231811523438
Oh oh that is a large sum	565.7511596679688
If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price	21.6627140045166
Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	62.639305114746094
He made a great start and looked at me	116.25044250488281
I also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in Lyons	90.55496978759766
For a thousand pistoles	53.96408462524414
For a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many	91.1830825805664
And you have them	66.21100616455078
They are here	56.60813903808594
Upon my word I think he acted very generously	25.338146209716797
Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service	94.37227630615234
A great servicewhat was that	61.61400604248047
Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament councillor	30.424264907836914
What that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery	54.14415740966797
That s the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	98.21366119384766
Unfortunately I did nt crush him flat	77.98524475097656
It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance	39.922142028808594
See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another time	6.509068965911865
He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger	58.92743682861328
But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely	431.9139404296875
Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the councillor	1252.140625
Well lets say no more about it	20.283313751220703
How much were your animals worth Porthos	5.876824378967285
Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction	67.57349395751953
No matter you can tell within ten crowns	77.57811737060547
Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount	86.066162109375
There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said DArtagnan contentedly	80.21421813964844
Yes said Porthos but there are the equipments	127.46857452392578
That is very true	104.81610107421875
Well how much for the equipments	71.35186004638672
If we say one hundred pistoles for the three	69.49288177490234
Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty	63.864891052246094
Porthos made a sign of assent	177.662109375
We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said DArtagnan and share the three hundred	28.68021011352539
We will share said Porthos	327.76641845703125
A paltry piece of business murmured DArtagnan crumpling his note	142.7628631591797
Pooh said Porthos it is always that	63.995574951171875
But tell me	124.07238006591797
Did nt he speak of me in any way	56.07588195800781
Ah yes indeed cried DArtagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said	76.30931091308594
He said resumed Porthos	293.21435546875
Stop I want to remember his exact words	86.53643798828125
He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace	15.598034858703613
Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron	81.07508850097656
At this moment nine oclock struck	353.4395446777344
DArtagnan started	88.13362884521484
Ah yes said Porthos there is nine oclock	121.58277130126953
We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place Royale	88.7705078125
Ah stop hold your peace Porthos do nt remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday	221.8069305419922
I shall not go	99.69053649902344
Why asked Porthos	132.9309844970703
Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise	116.66326141357422
And yet said Porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	34.663307189941406
I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand	39.57441711425781
Yes said DArtagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose	89.31584930419922
Oh said Porthos you ca nt think that DArtagnan	50.98127746582031
DArtagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	130.40414428710938
We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	84.52513122558594
We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place Royale	89.19667053222656
Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it	20.642024993896484
Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	44.4389762878418
We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn something else	104.46178436279297
You really have some distrust then said Porthos	45.0262451171875
Of Aramis yes since he has become an abb	61.9073486328125
You ca nt imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is	119.50333404541016
He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way	33.667720794677734
Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos and it would nt surprise me at all	30.10320472717285
Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us	42.391990661621094
Nonsense He had us in his power and he let us go	73.5982437133789
Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carbine	54.10133361816406
Planchet is a Frondeur answered DArtagnan	21.563077926635742
Devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said Porthos	363.7641906738281
Ah if Mousqueton were here there s a fellow who will never desert me	215.9477996826172
So long as you are rich Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	2.000459671020508
It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness	716.5866088867188
Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid	42.59638214111328
Halloo Planchet here saddle our horses take your carbine	167.16842651367188
Whom are we going to attack sir	139.13833618164062
No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gascon	118.802001953125
You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people	134.81532287597656
Really did they said DArtagnan	147.31959533691406
Yes but he has been avenged	31.619142532348633
He was carried home in the arms of the people	49.738807678222656
His house has been full ever since	81.34925842285156
He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his door	142.53350830078125
And now whenever he wishes	54.433467864990234
Well whenever he wishes	45.53446960449219
Planchet began to sing	104.22008514404297
Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin Je crois quil gronde Contre le Mazarin	170.04783630371094
Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin	30.32286834716797
It does nt surprise me said DArtagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his councillor	19.197235107421875
You understand then monsieur resumed Planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against Monsieur Broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine	34.917781829833984
No do nt be alarmed but where did you get all these details	216.97874450683594
From a good source sir I heard it from Friquet	42.69141387939453
From Friquet I know that name	130.4020233154297
A son of Monsieur de Broussels servant and a lad that I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs	49.56266403198242
Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame asked DArtagnan	38.086055755615234
Yes that is the very boy he s patronized by Bazin	66.41053009033203
Ah yes I know	100.78705596923828
Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porthos	224.5840301513672
Gad replied DArtagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again	215.95614624023438
Whilst all this was going on Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg St	110.4717788696289
They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place	115.64321899414062
Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqueton	65.01008605957031
As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	461.3355712890625
Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to	487.9710693359375
What do you mean Aramis	30.11972999572754
That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing else	40.34273147583008
What our friends	116.06034851074219
Are become our most dangerous enemies Athos	63.73808670043945
Let us be on our guard	155.8478240966797
Oh my dear DHerblay	134.27391052246094
Who can say whether DArtagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal who can tell whether Mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us	34.57902145385742
What Aramis you think that DArtagnan that Porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy	44.719364166259766
Among friends my dear Athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem	347.630126953125
Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head	66.59943389892578
What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	20.457155227661133
We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which DArtagnan is blindly governed	291.69610595703125
He has been beaten	255.6837921142578
Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair	63.82942199707031
Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	55.01377487182617
Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	289.3216552734375
Let us take our precautions Athos	130.9353790283203
But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to us	46.10544204711914
Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too	145.5045623779297
An excuse for us to meet DArtagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false excuse to Porthos Oh Aramis continued Athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	356.6376953125
Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go unarmed	150.55169677734375
No for I will not allow you to do so	134.7966766357422
Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you	89.2918701171875
Be it so then replied Athos sorrowfully	81.72215270996094
And they pursued their road in mournful silence	146.492919921875
Scarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the Place Royale when they perceived three cavaliers DArtagnan Porthos and Planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and Planchet his musket by his side	105.07672119140625
They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade	46.34799575805664
Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same manner	48.08490753173828
They then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	20.65859603881836
Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired Aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those farfamed duels still extant in the memory of the Parisians and especially the inhabitants of the Place Royale	57.284217834472656
The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well suited	48.10477066040039
DArtagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place	48.28940200805664
Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom	90.6338119506836
If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves	124.10853576660156
This place if Monsieur dHerblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer	445.9434509277344
Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of DArtagnan and Porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile	925.2639770507812
Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him	102.11075592041016
You swear sir that it is not so	269.450439453125
Stop and Aramis gave him a louis dor	24.843584060668945
Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	284.7081298828125
Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends	152.74581909179688
Yes certainly added Athos and the other two	55.75215148925781
DArtagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it	105.97657775878906
You see he said to Porthos	3990.5263671875
What do I see	173.28121948242188
That he would nt swear	172.24595642089844
Swear what	169.26910400390625
That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to fight	66.93528747558594
And Aramis would nt swear	62.83935546875
Attention then	51.03335189819336
Athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	55.758583068847656
Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that DArtagnan and Porthos might enter	63.32131576538086
In passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenants sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal	75.41899108886719
Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under his belt	25.359783172607422
Alas I do replied Athos with a deep sigh	108.0975341796875
He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him last	260.7441101074219
The two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	66.97698211669922
Chapter XXVIII	2.000459671020508
The Place Royale	289.85675048828125
They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limetrees	121.96153259277344
There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and DArtagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them	132.01983642578125
After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos spoke	447.737060546875
Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself	192.49998474121094
Hear me count replied DArtagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts	231.81077575683594
I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur dHerblay If so speak out answered Athos	209.44235229492188
I have replied DArtagnan	152.2965850830078
When I saw you at your chateau at Bragelonne I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle	121.34565734863281
DArtagnan said Athos reproachfully	211.46302795410156
You asked for candor and you have it	94.20750427246094
You ask what I have against you I tell you	32.45733642578125
And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur dHerblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me	130.6626434326172
Really monsieur you say strange things said Aramis	42.35862731933594
You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them No you sounded me nothing more	50.87120056152344
Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I would nt serve Mazarin	47.23505783081055
But that is all	197.8560028076172
Did I tell you that I would nt serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the princes	133.06048583984375
We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	92.75287628173828
Were you a party man There is no doubt of that	129.05929565429688
Well why should not we too belong to a party You had your secret and we had ours we did nt exchange them	322.3791198730469
So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets	184.65948486328125
I do not reproach you monsieur said DArtagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your conduct	82.22077941894531
And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haughtily	196.7021484375
The blood mounted instantly to the temples of DArtagnan who arose and replied	136.0903778076172
I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits	61.3126335144043
On seeing DArtagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other	79.4843978881836
Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented him	116.90221405029297
DArtagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays adventure	165.8356475830078
I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour	78.95755004882812
Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the error	100.87628936767578
The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated him	42.55173873901367
He answered therefore	110.83722686767578
I think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of Bragelonne and that gentlemanhe pointed to Aramishad also something to tell me when I was in his convent	146.9552459716797
At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me However because I was prudent you must not take me for a fool	96.1378402709961
If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur dHerblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken out	122.14934539794922
What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that DArtagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longueville	247.1226806640625
I never meddle save with what concerns me and I know how to make believe that I have nt seen what does not concern me but I hate hypocrites and among that number I place musketeers who are abbs and abbs who are musketeers and he added turning to Porthos heres a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself	34.11933135986328
Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	52.96436309814453
He said yes and he put his hand on his sword	29.91994857788086
Aramis started back and drew his	82.39826965332031
DArtagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	16.488313674926758
Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right	43.65658187866211
Then turning to Aramis	87.15615844726562
Aramis he said break your sword	140.01119995117188
Aramis hesitated	53.26252746582031
It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	31.10849380493164
I wish it	122.15162658691406
Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage	234.6990203857422
These proceedings made DArtagnan and Porthos draw back	106.33667755126953
DArtagnan did not draw his sword Porthos put his back into the sheath	180.67393493652344
Never exclaimed Athos raising his right hand to Heaven never I swear before God who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you	14.254447937011719
We lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably I may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life	162.7000732421875
DArtagnan I have always loved you as my son Porthos we slept six years side by side Aramis is your brother as well as mine and Aramis has once loved you as I love you now and as I have ever loved you	173.65069580078125
What can Cardinal Mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to act as we pleased What is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queens head DArtagnan I ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you Aramis does the same to Porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part I shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you	78.52759552001953
I repeat my words Aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends	59.53600311279297
There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aramis	71.16718292236328
I swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends	124.67339324951172
I regret that I ever crossed swords with you Porthos I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now Athos come	30.11958122253418
Athos was about to retire	148.89849853515625
Oh no no do not go away exclaimed DArtagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character I swear that I would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you Athosof such a man as you Aramis	240.18170166015625
And he threw himself into the arms of Athos	159.78164672851562
My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his arms	68.73554992675781
And as for me said Porthos I swear nothing but I m choked	95.9627914428711
Forsooth If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Athos	69.45842742919922
My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as yours	53.102020263671875
Yes I have said it and I now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	84.34528350830078
I respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends	34.948020935058594
Ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but wewe shall remain I have a presentiment that we shall	166.37049865722656
Yes replied DArtagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion St	92.80109405517578
Gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleursdelis embroidered	59.91086196899414
Be it so cried Aramis	136.05844116210938
Cardinalists or Frondeurs what matters it Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures	133.04937744140625
And whenever added Athos we meet in battle at this word Place Royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage	130.8273468017578
You speak charmingly said Porthos	132.43148803710938
And are the first of men added DArtagnan	114.20746612548828
You excel us all	72.51420593261719
Athos smiled with ineffable pleasure	36.47612762451172
Tis then all settled	80.16217803955078
Gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good Christians	43.60764694213867
Egad said DArtagnan by Heaven yes	236.8108673095703
We should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said Aramis	90.8310546875
Ah I m ready to do what you will cried Porthos even to swear by Mahomet	1073.569580078125
Devil take me if I ve ever been so happy as at this moment	56.337646484375
And he wiped his eyes still moist	21.85625648498535
Has not one of you a cross asked Athos	144.36679077148438
Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls	54.80308532714844
Here is one he said	38.319068908691406
Well resumed Athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants Does this oath satisfy you	388.6888122558594
Yes said they all with one accord	120.94943237304688
Ah traitor muttered DArtagnan leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse	453.508056640625
Chapter XXIX	288.24554443359375
The Ferry across the Oise	53.25423812866211
We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to Flanders	142.45542907714844
In losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican Raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might betray	39.17414093017578
One hours rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young mans bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedoma pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependenceseemed to Raoul to gild not only Heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future	92.54006958007812
Nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from Athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	71.65357208251953
Another recollection contributed also to sadden Raoul on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of La Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to Olivains respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention	159.90061950683594
The aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of Ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	71.88511657714844
Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	85.92432403564453
With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached	31.07391357421875
As for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade Olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready	71.52716064453125
Olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst Raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees	129.43325805664062
Raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand	48.34169387817383
Ha ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they have nt left a mouthful and two bottles of Macon wine of which they have nt left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders	94.84542083740234
No friend replied Raoul smiling I am obliged to you but at this moment I want nothing but the things for which I have askedonly I shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie	84.2090072631836
Very well sir said the host Ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain	65.6785888671875
Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place	20.876827239990234
The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table	24.296491622924805
By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to write	90.4757308959961
The host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression	296.0490417480469
Beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	83.16998291015625
He s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to Olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite	91.73086547851562
My master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do he lost it the day before yesterday	75.34806823730469
And Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn Olivain according to the custom of servingmen well pleased with their place relating to the tavernkeeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst Raoul wrote on thus	78.88543701171875
SirAfter a four hours march I stop to write to you for I miss you every moment and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me	37.577877044677734
I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you	43.85150909423828
You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine	233.36024475097656
I entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if I may venture to tell you so I also feel anxious	159.22315979003906
It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me nothing	830.7181396484375
I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you	57.68977355957031
Now that you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring	473.9095458984375
You sustained me powerfully sir and I protest to you that today I feel very lonely	762.1218872070312
Will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from Blois to send me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt You can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you	57.353668212890625
I hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you	2.000459671020508
After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter	438.79425048828125
During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed	130.55270385742188
Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Senlis	162.15032958984375
The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace	23.781187057495117
At Verberie Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only threequarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavernkeeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace	113.43568420410156
Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company	244.70616149902344
It was about four oclock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them	37.61069869995117
He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noyon	73.22571563720703
Well let us sleep at Noyon said Raoul	74.4468002319336
Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning	112.64649963378906
I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early tomorrow	5324.15087890625
Eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage	94.56368255615234
The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on replied Raoul that I might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to Noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from Blois to Paris	1726.9893798828125
We shall arrive at eight oclock	375.98895263671875
The horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the road	172.3010711669922
Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling	141.9212188720703
Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in bed	50.081520080566406
There you must rest young people are such braggarts	18.82630157470703
It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimauds	119.94439697265625
Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	29.177339553833008
DArtagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration	91.63983917236328
Therefore in spite of Olivains remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him	174.2028045654297
A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark	116.93850708007812
Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank	109.66650390625
Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Olivain	65.96590423583984
At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	89.64869689941406
Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	483.57281494140625
Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there	354.20806884765625
A second scream more piercing than the first now sounded	185.75332641601562
Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting	345.91461181640625
But what do I see in the watersomething struggling	72.46495056152344
Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider	344.1904602050781
They are sinking cried Olivain in his turn	174.9202117919922
It was true and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth	112.1497802734375
Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God	33.30497360229492
Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger	106.21273040771484
This was in fact a custom familiar to him	76.02522277832031
Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across	32.33392333984375
Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings	151.21273803710938
Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now	89.85661315917969
The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	169.47584533691406
But Ibut I cried Olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall I cross	26.988750457763672
Leap coward cried Raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him Courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid	183.08534240722656
Olivain advanced retired then made his horse rearturned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as Raoul had done only repeating	118.70811462402344
I am a dead man we are lost	32.376312255859375
In the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	76.06961059570312
A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly	170.1561279296875
Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking	407.86773681640625
The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	128.06520080566406
One moment longer and all would disappear	153.7801971435547
Courage cried Raoul courage	361.5993347167969
Too late murmured the young man too late	36.773067474365234
The water closed above his head and stifled his voice	130.53067016601562
Raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	67.30209350585938
Raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man	58.37311553955078
Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words	77.28761291503906
All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand	104.71868896484375
Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom	621.399658203125
Saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into Raouls arms Raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet	243.3249053955078
A moment later the grayheaded man was beside him	54.87784957885742
Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat	116.80703735351562
Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him	134.39280700683594
Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead manthrice dead	19.930936813354492
But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little bath	295.63836669921875
Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	26.256343841552734
Ah there you are my good DArminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own fault	41.884986877441406
You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim	459.5278015136719
Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again	32.4208869934082
But how did the accident happen asked Raoul	144.335693359375
Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	168.6040496826172
We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke	54.2935791015625
Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water	356.6640625
I can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river	523.2210693359375
Instead of aiding the movements of my horse I paralyzed them and I was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death	30.041494369506836
Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure you	65.05561065673828
I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you are	79.73394775390625
I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had done	413.68310546875
Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due	246.795654296875
Shake handsI crave your friendship	54.185523986816406
Sir said Raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech you	266.7440185546875
And now where are you going viscount inquired De Guiche	92.4294662475586
To join the army under the prince count	142.67840576171875
And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	100.73626708984375
Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together	56.35532760620117
It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet	450.7854309082031
And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn	35.11653137207031
Linen and wine are both being warmed come	44.00065231323242
The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	193.00146484375
They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	108.34967803955078
They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles	159.455810546875
De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only fifteen	77.6335220336914
Chapter XXX	91.42070007324219
The halt at Noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	148.57106018066406
Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not arrive	103.12609100341797
Doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them	91.94869232177734
The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him goodday	137.30641174316406
They breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten miles	51.00752639770508
The young counts conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	84.52702331542969
Brought up in Paris where Raoul had been but once at the court which Raoul had never seen his follies as page two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutors vigilancethese things excited the greatest curiosity in Raoul	53.73734664916992
Raoul had only been at M	73.16536712646484
Scarrons house he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there	328.2245178222656
Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan Mademoiselle dAubigne Mademoiselle de Scudery Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevreuse	55.222957611083984
He criticised everybody humorously	277.9195556640625
Raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor	218.85223388671875
His praises increased Raouls friendship twofold	375.60797119140625
Then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	52.27399826049805
Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	63.97208023071289
He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	127.3813247680664
De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	405.6790466308594
It was the same court of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the Count de Guiche related was new to his traveling companion	2.000459671020508
The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	190.92135620117188
The day passed away as rapidly as an hour	35.248046875
The counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte de la Fere	150.8826446533203
The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four oclock in the evening	83.42948150634766
They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	92.75115203857422
The French army held all between PontaMarc as far as Valenciennes falling back upon Douai	43.111053466796875
The prince was said to be in person at Bethune	266.08673095703125
The enemys army extended from Cassel to Courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them	53.5058479309082
Arras was encumbered with fugitives	85.29057312011719
An approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him	32.67040252685547
The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely	11.758960723876953
The evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	28.80657958984375
In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Cond had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city	148.42440795898438
But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary	100.56430053710938
The counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of Lens and that of Bethune	89.27365112304688
They obtained information at Ablain and a statement of their route was left for Grimaud	83.24163818359375
About seven oclock in the morning they set out	148.35818481445312
De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three servants	79.63280487060547
Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough	40.49977111816406
I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises something	27.155879974365234
Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when required	170.74400329589844
On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my father	187.79090881347656
We therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul	53.67987823486328
Certainly sir replied the viscount	166.48358154296875
Holloa young peoplestop there said the tutor joining in the conversation	57.515743255615234
Zounds how you manoeuvre my instructions count You seem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince Once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time I warn you that in my capacity of general of the army I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across	52.07510757446289
De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other smiling	140.84251403808594
They arrived at Ablain without accident	65.71815490722656
There they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venthie	72.8719253540039
Therefore leaving directions at every place for Grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys	20.89219856262207
The country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald	91.7557601928711
Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following	101.80316162109375
In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance guard	138.09242248535156
Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst Olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear	54.36271286010742
They had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it Monsieur dArminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two grooms	265.7820129394531
The servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	125.72852325439453
Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musketshots	176.68507385253906
The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop	149.92213439941406
The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants	11.309944152832031
The tutor followed them	160.97593688964844
Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two youths	17.832704544067383
No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice	67.93547058105469
My advice is this said Monsieur dArminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat	76.24642944335938
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood	50.3502197265625
Did you see nothing there asked the count	111.59675598144531
I thought I saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream	293.51861572265625
That s it said the tutor	643.6984252929688
We have fallen in with a party of Spaniards	64.4227523803711
Come back sirs back	182.8978271484375
The two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	135.54945373535156
Another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horses head they both spurred forward Raoul crying Follow me Olivain and the Count de Guiche Follow Urban and Planchet And before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest	260.7168884277344
Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	133.59828186035156
In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously	41.52593994140625
Hush whispered De Guiche these are cavaliers	83.02012634277344
Yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted	163.36451721191406
Can you see what they are doing	91.11771392822266
Yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man	165.45265197753906
It is some cowardly assassination said De Guiche	61.96246337890625
They are soldiers though resumed De Bragelonne	149.7332305908203
Yes skirmishers that is to say highway robbers	113.16484832763672
At them cried Raoul	145.91094970703125
At them echoed De Guiche	47.42473602294922
Oh gentlemen gentlemen in the name of Heaven cried the poor tutor	100.20520782470703
But he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the Spaniards	62.16265869140625
The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two	163.19610595703125
De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	43.61167526245117
He let off his fire at but four paces	10.833032608032227
Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off	210.61090087890625
Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	131.7540740966797
His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raouls leg under its body	24.133235931396484
The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt	172.1946258544922
In the position in which Raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters	77.4638671875
The butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat	337.70965576171875
Yield he cried or you are a dead man The musket fell from the soldiers hands who yielded on the instant	32.95536804199219
Guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached Raoul	196.75880432128906
Faith sir said Raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	41.16179275512695
Without your aid continued he repeating the counts words I should have been a dead manthrice dead	43.14961624145508
My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	223.42628479003906
But are you seriously wounded I see you are covered with blood	189.36036682128906
I believe said Raoul that I have got something like a scratch on the arm	81.02642822265625
If you will help me to drag myself from under my horse I hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey	77.35913848876953
Monsieur dArminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse	112.22937774658203
At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again	46.933311462402344
Nothing broken asked De Guiche	32.43505096435547
Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering	1307.2127685546875
I fear we arrived too late	525.2037353515625
They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their booty	95.93236541748047
My servants are examining the bodies	27.009382247924805
Let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested Raoul	591.1978149414062
Olivain we have come into possession of two horses but I have lost my own	66.06568908691406
Take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours	64.80708312988281
They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay	87.72663116455078
Chapter XXXI	89.91979217529297
The Monk	100.40680694580078
Two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	41.456626892089844
The other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven	40.931854248046875
He had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone	43.30821990966797
The young men first approached the dead man	1.679030418395996
He is a priest said Bragelonne he has worn the tonsure	38.64776611328125
Oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against a minister of God	98.01309967041016
Come here sir said Urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other	117.03015899658203
The wounded man smiled sadly	97.91233825683594
Save me Oh no said he but help me to die if you can	78.9541244506836
Are you a priest asked Raoul	335.5860595703125
No sir	68.74486541748047
I ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church	159.09210205078125
He is the curate of Bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so I offered to do so	46.486751556396484
And sir continued the wounded man I suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house	34.8981819152832
Where you can be relieved asked De Guiche	114.93619537353516
No where I can confess	67.34741973876953
But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said Raoul	74.13429260253906
Sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines	94.37916564941406
Are you a surgeon asked De Guiche	58.846961975097656
No but I know a little about wounds and mine I know is mortal	67.60946655273438
Try therefore either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here	59.87875747680664
It is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost	88.14225006103516
To die whilst doing a good deed It is impossible	35.46565246582031
God will help you	63.335235595703125
Gentlemen in the name of Heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words	139.64002990722656
Either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first cur the first priest you may meet	52.86768341064453
But he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the Spaniards are ranging through the country and I shall die without absolution	84.51062774658203
My God my God Good God good God added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that that would be too terrible	36.64359664916992
Calm yourself sir replied De Guiche	40.825103759765625
I swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask	214.8705291748047
Only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest	27.40578269958496
Thank you and God reward you About half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of Greney	79.3223876953125
There you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the Augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers	342.7290954589844
Monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis	62.75859832763672
Monsieur dArminges said De Guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible	326.7862243652344
The vicomte and myself will go and find a priest	50.88489532470703
Go sir replied the tutor but in Heavens name do not expose yourself to danger	57.108848571777344
Do not fear	670.9912719726562
Besides we are safe for today you know the axiom Non bis in idem	78.48705291748047
Courage sir said Raoul to the wounded man	63.35136413574219
We are going to execute your wishes	93.15564727783203
May Heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	65.19541931152344
The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn	235.2820281982422
Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful	104.08837890625
He desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	51.10396957397461
The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Greney	67.3946762084961
They had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the redtiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an Augustine brother	149.7889404296875
Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking	62.19038391113281
He was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises	53.145538330078125
His complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression	111.6227798461914
Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic	232.34251403808594
Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil	165.49722290039062
Because we want to know said De Guiche haughtily	87.85317993164062
The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	84.50192260742188
In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	60.174522399902344
Answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer	82.29883575439453
I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me	32.81114196777344
It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks bones	48.33595657348633
In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche	35.93564987182617
Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church	31.425140380859375
If you be a priest I conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man if you be not it is a different matter and I warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that I shall chastise you for your insolence	145.25146484375
The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult	296.23712158203125
He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	5.095914840698242
A glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to Raoul	87.56555938720703
Well sir said De Guiche are you going to reply	85.24053192138672
I am a priest said the young man	197.89987182617188
Then father said Raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation	76.13903045654297
At the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of God	580.7756958007812
I will go said the monk	145.71868896484375
And he touched his mule	70.60594940185547
If you do not go sir said De Guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be and then I swear your trial will be summary one can always find a tree and a cord	167.17185974121094
The monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase I will goand he went	30.829147338867188
Let us follow him said De Guiche it will be the surest plan	58.92856216430664
I was about to propose so doing answered De Bragelonne	94.5714340209961
In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not	18.757234573364258
You see said Raoul we have done wisely	236.05743408203125
What a horrible face that monk has said De Guiche	59.65347671508789
Horrible replied Raoul especially in expression	71.96359252929688
Yes yes said De Guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost	129.55532836914062
Well said Raoul the poor man will get his priest but by Heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor	1085.7135009765625
I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance	103.33214569091797
Ah exclaimed De Guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them they are mostly foreignersScotch Irish or Danish	179.62387084960938
I have seen them before	62.74549102783203
As ugly	68.59829711914062
No but reasonably hideous	123.85692596435547
What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar	76.68868255615234
Pshaw said De Guiche	91.74971771240234
Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from God	65.09054565429688
However for my part I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor	52.911834716796875
You are of my opinion are you not viscount and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers head	37.5815315246582
Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man	114.39118957519531
Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path	180.4344940185547
Never answered De Guiche	41.71884536743164
Well it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests and I remember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue I remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the Comte de la Fere	99.0210189819336
Your father asked De Guiche	62.11090087890625
No my guardian replied Raoul blushing	2.000459671020508
Very well	2062.805419921875
Until the moment when the Comte de la Fere resumed Raoul said Come Bragelonne draw your sword then only I rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me	64.61906433105469
Well I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said Why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at me	109.38333892822266
Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels	35.39359664916992
Faith yes almost said Raoul	186.89572143554688
They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur dArminges	73.92037963867188
The youths spurred on	154.45233154296875
There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine brother	44.25129318237305
Be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk	71.69803619384766
As for Raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion	173.59524536132812
The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest	192.1255645751953
He raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	46.459815979003906
And now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste to rejoin the princes army we must continue our journey	77.28426361083984
You will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it	41.61289978027344
Go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	40.582645416259766
You have done for me as you promised all that you could do	313.1880187988281
As for me I can only repeat may God protect you and all dear to you	84.29611206054688
Sir said De Guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to Cambrin	88.96987915039062
The host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to Lens the nearest village for a doctor	31.693796157836914
Everything said he to Raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed	45.04286575317383
Oh my woundminetis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at Mazingarbe and to stop at Cambrin	108.70722961425781
This cavalier is my attendant	47.68690872192383
Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host	138.05087280273438
There is no harm in overprecaution	122.69381713867188
I am the Viscount de Bragelonne and he is called Grimaud	464.5629577636719
At this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed	220.38525390625
Sir monk said De Guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid	58.0723876953125
Thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made Bragelonne shudder	89.14250183105469
Come count said Raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the Augustine come I feel ill here and the two young men spurred on	30.30315399169922
The litter borne by two servants now entered the house	35.425254821777344
The host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	171.06008911132812
At sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	59.91691589355469
Well what s the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now	114.09544372558594
No but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man I ask you if you recognize him	105.71649169921875
That manwait a bit	52.85243225097656
Ah I see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn	65.79368591308594
Truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of Bethune	212.1725616455078
The former executioner of Bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired	290.7659912109375
Monsieur dArminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation	182.70553588867188
Sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man	298.7690124511719
Render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious	124.53833770751953
The monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed	13.295470237731934
DArminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion	226.5834503173828
Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn	89.666748046875
What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made	98.0450210571289
The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	20.836135864257812
Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	51.503204345703125
And where will your worship drink	116.71980285644531
There answered the traveler pointing to the table	54.83092498779297
I was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb	64.42139434814453
And what else does your worship wish for	84.93987274169922
To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom	51.700538635253906
The Viscount de Bragelonne	184.4939422607422
Just so	60.60002136230469
Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud	130.815185546875
The traveler made a sign of assent	57.19606018066406
Well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambrin	72.94896697998047
How far is Mazingarbe	326.223388671875
Two miles and a half	167.34780883789062
Thank you	707.8265380859375
Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man	113.03530883789062
Grimaud sprang up	120.1936264038086
What is that said he whence comes that cry	184.69805908203125
From the wounded mans room replied the host	63.56147766113281
What wounded man	72.68778228759766
The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine friar	17.88783073425293
The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard	98.80594635009766
That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the host	266.396728515625
I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection	157.31834411621094
At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard	215.47804260253906
The three listeners looked at one another in alarm	97.61324310302734
We must see what it is said Grimaud	822.9256591796875
It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	21.525344848632812
Mon Dieu said the woman crossing herself	109.56541442871094
If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side	7.78179931640625
Open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk	52.44730758666992
No reply	160.2711639404297
Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grimaud	119.80892944335938
The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt	180.66065979003906
The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	71.36659240722656
The monk cried the host where is the monk	355.72955322265625
Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard	176.1731414794922
He has escaped by this means exclaimed he	67.27558898925781
Do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable	126.0263671875
There is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed	71.00109100341797
The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	225.63414001464844
There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he	33.42168426513672
Does he still live inquired the innkeeper	91.95198059082031
Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pallid	77.88761901855469
The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	81.23320007324219
Run run for help cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him here	145.01866149902344
The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	57.27173614501953
Chapter XXXII	54.35908126831055
The Absolution	20.34706687927246
This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner	5686.08203125
Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so	24.504560470581055
He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	102.08924102783203
And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as confessor	72.53131866455078
The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	214.84266662597656
The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	238.72976684570312
He made a movement of surprise and said	40.12624740600586
Father you are very young	51.159950256347656
Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly	30.66132926940918
Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a friend	59.310001373291016
Do you suffer much asked the monk	164.94015502929688
Yes but in my soul much more than in my body	32.79701614379883
We will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of Bethune as these people say	23.094341278076172
That is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claimthat is to say I was but am no longer it is fifteen years since I gave up the office	84.96446228027344
I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno indeed	14.401926040649414
You have then a repugnance to your profession	82.97394561767578
So long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as I was by justice and law but since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of Gods creaturessince that day	15.865839004516602
The executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair	43.31443786621094
Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced	130.52662658691406
Ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took away	245.7693634033203
That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me	69.9986572265625
All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that womans ghost rising before me	124.73737335205078
A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the monk	63.21126174926758
You also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated I have assassinated then and not executed I am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan	435.4779357910156
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly	29.180992126464844
Go on I know nothing as yet when you have finished your story God and I will judge	261.2432861328125
Oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of naturethe whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the waveunited in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me Place for the justice of God	80.91700744628906
Delirium murmured the monk shaking his head	86.88983917236328
The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm	127.28144073486328
Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no I remember too well	2.000459671020508
It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride pronounced	7808.6318359375
After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of God	68.07422637939453
But let me see how was it done Speak said the monk	106.22042083740234
It was at night	96.30636596679688
A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed him	145.47146606445312
Four other noblemen awaited me	23.492671966552734
They led me away masked	101.18094635009766
I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	157.2606658935547
We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking	163.3762664794922
At length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed	56.36494827270508
Horrible said the monk	32.81114196777344
And you obeyed	75.69554138183594
Father that woman was a monster	194.05706787109375
It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered	54.63932418823242
Buckingham cried the monk	67.62174987792969
Yes Buckingham	43.23473358154297
The woman was English then	7596.17431640625
No she was French but she had married in England	189.6414794921875
The monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	51.52342987060547
The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed	257.2455749511719
No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	16.262672424316406
Go on who were those men	49.24324417114258
One of them was a foreigner English I think	13.786980628967285
The four others were French and wore the uniform of musketeers	36.4186897277832
Their names asked the monk	145.08090209960938
I do nt know them but the four other noblemen called the Englishman my lord	85.77702331542969
Was the woman handsome	79.44173431396484
Young and beautiful	2.1138858795166016
Oh yes especially beautiful	302.5126037597656
I see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life	127.470703125
I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale	56.24641036987305
The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask	54.392555236816406
At length with a violent effort at selfcontrol	75.96644592285156
The name of that woman he said	225.41647338867188
I do nt know what it was	259.00738525390625
As I have said she was twice married once in France the second time in England	96.75205993652344
She was young you say	119.89756774902344
Twentyfive years old	121.61825561523438
Abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders	122.50166320800781
Eyes of an admirable expression	148.68756103515625
When she chose	70.88030242919922
Oh yes it is she	73.74794006347656
A voice of strange sweetness	7.120925426483154
How do you know it	316.7092590332031
The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid	53.659324645996094
And you killed her the monk exclaimed	68.12232208251953
You were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves You had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness you killed that woman	122.97671508789062
Alas I have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when I saw her when I recalled all the evil she had done to me	679.9617309570312
To you What could she have done to you Come tell me	80.60723114013672
She had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	85.0655288696289
She had fled with him from her convent	90.1361083984375
With your brother	80.29940795898438
Yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	164.3000030517578
Oh father do not look in that way at me Oh I am guilty then you will not pardon me	77.31813049316406
The monk recovered his usual expression	125.24504089355469
Yes yes he said I will pardon you if you tell me all	51.74839782714844
Oh cried the executioner all all all	54.16429901123047
Answer then	41.359771728515625
If she seduced your brotheryou said she seduced him did you not	109.78140258789062
If she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death	87.04352569580078
Yes repeated the executioner	60.44404220581055
Then you must know what her name was as a young girl	244.13204956054688
Oh mon Dieu cried the executioner I think I am dying	43.006065368652344
Absolution father absolution	75.45736694335938
Tell me her name and I will give it	75.94116973876953
Her name wasMy God have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die	72.35169982910156
Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution	45.49694061279297
The dying man collected all his forces	106.87092590332031
The monks eyes glittered	9.012611389160156
Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded man	205.29356384277344
Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to Heaven	14.976051330566406
Anne de Bueil You said Anne de Bueil did you not	102.37593078613281
Yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for I am dying	66.10413360595703
I absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying mans hair stand on end I absolve you I am not a priest	25.27798843383789
You are not a priest cried the executioner	71.5427474975586
What then are you	24.882732391357422
I am about to tell you wretched man	14.17026424407959
Oh mon Dieu	79.44173431396484
I am John Francis de Winter	64.31768035888672
I do not know you said the executioner	29.166614532470703
Wait wait you are going to know me	146.29808044433594
I am John Francis de Winter he repeated and that woman	32.01213073730469
Well that woman	335.568603515625
Was my mother	756.699951171875
The executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard	71.9398422241211
Oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of God at least in your own name if not as priest then as son	46.07756042480469
Pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you Perhaps God will pardon you but I never	56.37599563598633
For pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	153.90330505371094
No pity for him who had no pity Die impenitent die in despair die and be damned And drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying Here is my absolution	134.66029357910156
Then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	335.72735595703125
The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed	45.256324768066406
As to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris	120.67440795898438
Chapter XXXIII	106.46122741699219
Grimaud Speaks	46.381534576416016
Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes	75.60193634033203
Help help he murmured oh God have I not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die	17.685443878173828
Take courage said Grimaud they are gone to find assistance	79.28910827636719
Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grimaud	158.90196228027344
An old acquaintance replied Grimaud	93.80921173095703
You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him	163.42996215820312
Under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	35.59496307373047
One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentieres	193.83677673339844
I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms	79.98001861572266
Just so	2.000459671020508
Where do you come from now	59.612247467041016
I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	91.49065399169922
They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries	382.356689453125
At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open	84.22856903076172
And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk	47.117286682128906
What monk	115.9560775756836
The monk that was shut in with me	139.46926879882812
No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	1521.71728515625
Was he the man that stabbed you	58.50679016113281
Yes said the executioner	34.92551040649414
Grimaud moved as if to leave the room	238.55316162109375
What are you going to do asked the wounded man	59.79667282104492
He must be apprehended	53.87477493286133
Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	101.07115173339844
Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is expiated	136.6471710205078
Explain yourself	82.27886962890625
said Grimaud	148.9729461669922
The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill	160.9076385498047
Yes Milady it is true you called her thus	39.431678771972656
What has the monk to do with this Milady	58.78346633911133
She was his mother	59.839969635009766
Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner	125.69579315185547
His mother he repeated	9.421152114868164
Yes his mother	97.58741760253906
But does he know this secret then	227.70816040039062
I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession	83.79647827148438
Unhappy man cried Grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one I hope	138.95150756835938
I pronounced no name for I knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges	138.11053466796875
Thus speaking he fell back exhausted	140.46946716308594
Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger	82.58191680908203
Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall die	39.01067352294922
Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed	216.6352996826172
Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost	38.60566329956055
Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	44.256526947021484
My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure	40.379146575927734
Where was the monk going asked Grimaud	155.62400817871094
Toward Paris	115.12422180175781
Who stopped him	362.8453369140625
Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mentionthe Viscount de Bragelonne	673.6139526367188
And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grimaud	45.48822021484375
And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so	27.585302352905273
On ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes	109.20994567871094
Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la Fere	109.5510025024414
Whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot	34.029964447021484
The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted	6.245054244995117
We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner	26.906570434570312
The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his head	104.7138900756836
The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful	175.247314453125
When at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last deathrattle and expired	91.73489379882812
Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse	128.07583618164062
Grimauds first intention had been to return to Paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hours riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazingarbe	17.75361442565918
Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travelstained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner	37.01874923706055
Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend	61.580020904541016
How did you leave the count continued he	22.73579978942871
Does he regret me a little Have you seen him since I left him Answer for I have many things to tell you too indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happenedbut what is the matter how pale you are and blood too What is this	91.430908203125
It is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms	66.14543151855469
In your armsthat man but know you who he was	31.33078384399414
He used to be the headsman of Bethune	86.56619262695312
You knew him and he is dead	27.73522186279297
Well sir said DArminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted	20.621246337890625
I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow	17.16446304321289
At the mention of the monk Grimaud became pale	63.03601837158203
Come come continued DArminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast	47.16995620727539
You are right sir said Raoul	71.63402557373047
Come Grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk	27.432703018188477
No sir no said Grimaud	59.1947021484375
I can not stop a moment I must start for Paris again immediately	80.65290069580078
What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to remain	63.17814636230469
On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to go	42.56184387207031
I have come for nothing else but to tell you so	195.9989013671875
But what is the meaning of this change	48.72747802734375
I can not tell you	60.0214958190918
Explain yourself	55.687774658203125
I can not explain myself	50.36471176147461
Come tell me what is the joke	6.245054244995117
Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never joke	243.3108673095703
Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris	6.245054244995117
I shall follow the counts directions	142.5445098876953
Not under present circumstances monsieur	416.11041259765625
Perhaps you mean to disobey me	70.29293060302734
Yes monsieur I must	295.12200927734375
You persist then	55.107322692871094
Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	159.5206756591797
Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	56.85911178588867
Grimaud he cried remain I wish it	68.23194122314453
Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed	65.66725158691406
He saluted and made a movement to depart	232.52484130859375
Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heavens name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his chair	83.31525421142578
I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own	174.67359924316406
You met a monk did you not	78.66629791259766
The young men looked at each other with an expression of fear	35.54384231567383
You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him	444.5737609863281
Yes yes cried both young men	54.80418395996094
Very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth	21.33868980407715
And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	56.85287857055664
Two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to Paris	111.93389129638672
When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	48.73491287231445
But Grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	100.79902648925781
Chapter XXXIV	15.523604393005371
On the Eve of Battle	17.9320011138916
Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards	117.1496353149414
That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	12.182425498962402
The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Bethune	82.18228912353516
While Monsieur dArminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and cavalry	157.08836364746094
This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	81.73387908935547
There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dArminges and beat a retreat	268.564453125
They quickly went downstairs	763.85107421875
Monsieur dArminges was already mounted	130.5669708251953
Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use	35.22636032104492
As a further precaution they had bound his hands	55.84295654296875
The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the prince	252.2978973388672
But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys movements	158.6485595703125
Deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between VieilleChapelle and La Venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with Marshal de Grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	75.53829956054688
He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned	63.87079620361328
The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	235.52516174316406
Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	66.53218078613281
The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see him	79.82860565185547
The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	23.1373233795166
The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	127.1159896850586
Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard	44.5388069152832
The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of cannon	132.24887084960938
Every one stood up	53.7031364440918
At that moment the door opened	57.88762283325195
Monseigneur said Marshal de Grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son Count de Guiche and his traveling companion Viscount de Bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him	255.70843505859375
What eagerly replied the prince will I permit I not only permit I desire let them come in	217.6047821044922
The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	334.3902587890625
Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments	45.732208251953125
The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing	20.610586166381836
It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	28.81186294555664
Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time	70.40721893310547
He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingarbe	220.4159393310547
Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordlingen	162.21530151367188
Louis de Bourbon Prince de Cond who since the death of his father Henri de Bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period Monsieur le Prince was a young man not more than twentysix or twentyseven years old with the eye of an eagleagl occhi grifani as Dante saysaquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldierthat is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage	257.28302001953125
At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at Paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after Bassompierre Bellegarde and the Duke dAngouleme were called the petitsmaitres	153.0280303955078
At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything	35.19520950317383
The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of France	45.06241226196289
But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not respond	70.38221740722656
Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	59.220787048339844
Raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince	121.40399932861328
My lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty	73.40327453613281
The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old	62.918033599853516
Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman	56.514068603515625
My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish prisoner	78.72869873046875
Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the prince	23.62461280822754
Yes my lord	158.56695556640625
Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten it	115.76299285888672
That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul smiling	43.29933166503906
The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed	388.8155822753906
The young man is right let the prisoner be brought in	106.30717468261719
Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	269.8907470703125
Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel	31.08542251586914
My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count	120.62867736816406
But here is the letter	68.3896255493164
Very well said the prince give it to me later	35.038902282714844
Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing	11.202169418334961
The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils	38.11315155029297
Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged	229.70901489257812
The prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust	92.47937774658203
Of what country are you asked the prince	162.1717529296875
The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	25.147851943969727
Ah ah it seems that he is a Spaniard	64.89179992675781
Do you speak Spanish Grammont	55.47487258911133
Faith my lord but indifferently	50.52313995361328
And I not at all said the prince laughing	148.60633850097656
Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter	25.274240493774414
I can my lord said Raoul	236.79405212402344
Ah you speak Spanish	145.808349609375
Enough I think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this occasion	66.57908630371094
Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place	153.3380126953125
My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Castilian	48.16065979003906
Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the prisoner	71.01636505126953
What in the devil does he say asked the prince	79.24043273925781
What new gibberish is that	152.69796752929688
He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective	37.122535705566406
Then you speak German also asked the prince	70.49520111083984
Yes my lord	51.62659454345703
Well enough to question him in that language	211.49256896972656
Yes my lord	75.4694595336914
Question him then	82.58242797851562
Raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion	89.2765884399414
The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsatian	112.42767333984375
However amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural accent	26.73786163330078
Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italiano	96.13399505615234
The prisoner started and bit his lips	50.45558547973633
Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the examination	127.72259521484375
Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my interpreter	26.0745849609375
But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	135.94412231445312
Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army	59.60124588012695
Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he does nt wish to speak	63.6356201171875
Take him out and shoot him	114.18585205078125
The prisoner turned pale	208.19801330566406
The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	80.02682495117188
When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped	175.16162109375
The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along	75.898193359375
One moment said the prisoner in French	59.93606185913086
I am ready to speak my lord	349.19049072265625
Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to that	98.05839538574219
I have a sure method of limbering tongues	68.63876342773438
Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command	150.39756774902344
But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe	77.97773742675781
Upon my honor said the prince	152.7640380859375
Question then my lord	212.95433044433594
Where did the army cross the Lys	103.45569610595703
Between SaintVenant and Aire	164.92379760742188
By whom is it commanded	57.8491325378418
By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archduke	253.22633361816406
Of how many does it consist	120.45514678955078
Eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon	217.6971435546875
And its aim is	204.31541442871094
You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers	80.5007553100586
Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius	512.4418334960938
Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and DErlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the Lys	365.89593505859375
Let them hold themselves in readiness to march tonight	208.69964599609375
Tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy	51.53801345825195
But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men	51.9940071105957
Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won	271.567138671875
Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight	2.000459671020508
His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot	170.75164794921875
The prisoner was led away	98.65421295166016
Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him	641.5238037109375
Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow me	155.54649353027344
To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	41.82611846923828
The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	89.19888305664062
Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in action	46.090824127197266
And I said the marshal what am I to do	107.07675170898438
Wait here to receive the troops	91.9788589477539
I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	355.43707275390625
Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my escort	101.63495635986328
That is very few said the marshal	139.0670928955078
It is enough replied the prince	66.1012954711914
Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne	185.22760009765625
My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lackeys	137.69705200195312
Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best	70.26036071777344
No false modesty take the best horse you can find	212.95333862304688
You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow	126.8743667602539
Raoul did nt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a piebald Andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for Athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	423.25933837890625
Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought	69.24014282226562
Raoul handed the letter to the prince	77.93458557128906
Keep near me said the latter	102.6729736328125
The prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wo nt to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of Madame de Longueville and started at a gallop on the road to Lens attended by Raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions	185.4725799560547
The prince read as he hastened on	158.94158935546875
Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	120.00642395019531
I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been told	214.26116943359375
Raoul bowed	53.18868637084961
Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder	522.154296875
The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey	28.66168785095215
One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon	23.089336395263672
From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse	106.60408020019531
At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aunay	122.17923736572266
The peasants were in great commotion	52.221866607666016
The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	90.17166137695312
The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men remained	81.87442779541016
On seeing the prince they hastened to meet him	113.34149169921875
One of them recognized him	18.381269454956055
Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers	55.940025329589844
Yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide	18.542848587036133
Willingly my lord	129.11488342285156
Where does your highness wish to go	104.79671478271484
To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country	36.711341857910156
In that case I m your man	35.30524826049805
I can trust youyou are a true Frenchman	55.925167083740234
I am an old soldier of Rocroy my lord	184.64064025878906
Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Rocroy	75.38214111328125
Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot	66.42677307128906
Afoot my lord I have served always in the infantry	20.207294464111328
Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk	90.58723449707031
Come then said the prince let us lose no time	22.28750228881836
The peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley	126.71965026855469
For a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls	35.54062271118164
At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside	13.97276782989502
The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert	54.50324630737305
He then began to ascend the path	15.44704532623291
In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country	78.68895721435547
At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemys entire army	14.429707527160645
With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vimy	115.06117248535156
In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind	150.9058837890625
He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote	44.175682067871094
My Dear MarshalIn an hour Lens will be in the enemys possession	55.4854850769043
Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	36.36167907714844
I shall be at Vendin to place it in position	33.52935791015625
Tomorrow we shall retake Lens and beat the enemy	120.31507873535156
Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Grammont	230.14207458496094
Raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop	44.850860595703125
A quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal	535.2186279296875
A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment	149.77609252929688
Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the rest	207.96800231933594
All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	88.15552520751953
It was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place	114.39997100830078
The prince awaited him there	111.38165283203125
As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raouls departure	420.61724853515625
The event was announced by the cessation of the firing	241.81166076660156
As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments	220.81674194335938
Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded	34.90913391113281
At nine oclock the night had fully come	22.11042594909668
Still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	207.2809295654297
The army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	2974.937255859375
Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault	561.7540893554688
The prince assigned to every one his post	129.84092712402344
Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Mericourt	84.18408203125
The Duc de Chatillon commanded the centre	132.9944610595703
Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aunay	60.620540618896484
The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening	282.9700012207031
Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle	97.59728240966797
The movement was executed in silence and with precision	70.2666244506836
At ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	97.98963928222656
Three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first	44.22008514404297
The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them	107.16276550292969
A tent was erected for them near that of the marshal	72.03791809082031
Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep	123.40553283691406
And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	100.17945861816406
On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers	28.685470581054688
It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable	61.76823806762695
Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	152.57089233398438
The letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written words	22.051244735717773
The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic	18.32147216796875
The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	38.965030670166016
In case any evil should happen to me said Bragelonne	251.68809509277344
In case I should be killed said De Guiche	61.29313659667969
They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants	64.67112731933594
Chapter XXXV	210.11627197265625
A Dinner in the Old Style	170.06016540527344
The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first	58.13445281982422
Athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	36.31928253173828
For different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the Rue de la Monnaie of the sign of the Hermitage	39.60594177246094
The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight oclock in the evening precisely	16.092809677124023
On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation	42.91080093383789
Porthos had been trying a new horse DArtagnan was on guard at the Louvre Aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood and Athos whose domicile was established in the Rue Guenegaud found himself close at hand	31.318927764892578
They were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the Hermitage Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf Porthos by the Rue de la Roule DArtagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain lAuxerrois and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy	11.131877899169922
The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	13.349953651428223
Athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	182.5245819091797
At this order given in Athoss habitually calm manner the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthoss brow grew smooth	47.010494232177734
Aramis was astonished	103.09280395507812
He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	83.59756469726562
This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm	41.48374938964844
His companions followed his example	121.99166107177734
In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits	24.54660415649414
Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	178.94822692871094
Soonstrange factAramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his entirely	110.17391967773438
Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	88.25045013427734
Faith said Aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little I should like to say something evil of Mazarin is it permissible	115.80783081054688
Go on go on replied DArtagnan laughing heartily relate your story and I will applaud it if it is a good one	31.095436096191406
A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him	69.64328002929688
The prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it	365.4581298828125
In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them	47.82670974731445
Ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then	317.3605041503906
The prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to Mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	235.38009643554688
What did Mazarin do	301.43853759765625
Stormed suggested Athos	21.236305236816406
Beat the messenger cried Porthos	94.08126831054688
Accepted the money said DArtagnan	207.26046752929688
You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting	61.65165328979492
At last their hilarity calmed down and	30.509042739868164
Faith exclaimed DArtagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no good	344.3634948730469
Pooh really asked Athos	2.000459671020508
If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew him	49.16667175292969
He knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for it	55.38255310058594
By whom	43.687381744384766
By me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any information	107.62220764160156
And what did you reply	90.06809997558594
That I had none as yet but that I was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some	536.7584838867188
You told him that said Porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	229.6790008544922
Bravo and you are not afraid of that Athos	293.2557373046875
No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear	96.158935546875
Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do fear	54.0147590637207
Nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest	339.187255859375
And with regard to the past asked Porthos	63.76295471191406
Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the future	277.5722961425781
Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aramis	178.75335693359375
Well said DArtagnan one is never killed in a first engagement	75.55648803710938
Nor in the second said Aramis	131.8053436279297
Nor in the third returned Porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are	73.74744415283203
No said Athos it is not Raoul about whom I am anxious for I trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killedwell he will die bravely but holdshould such a misfortune happenwell Athos passed his hand across his pale brow	117.0091781616211
Well asked Aramis	104.2538833618164
Well I shall look upon it as an expiation	291.0131530761719
Ah said DArtagnan I know what you mean	53.87636947631836
And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is past	100.32635498046875
I do nt understand said Porthos	44.41835403442383
The affair at Armentieres whispered DArtagnan	83.04203033447266
The affair at Armentieres asked he again	88.30862426757812
Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it	136.6879119873047
Athos looked at him intently	139.1867218017578
You have forgotten it Porthos said he	20.228740692138672
Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porthos	120.85396575927734
This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience	148.36221313476562
Faith no	68.23287963867188
And you DArtagnan	24.696928024291992
II own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancieux	48.30802917480469
Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin	1675.9622802734375
Athos shook his dead doubtfully	133.96795654296875
Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven	35.00457000732422
We were but the instruments that is all	203.04031372070312
But as to free will Aramis	312.08740234375
How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	98.23483276367188
What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse	147.82510375976562
The executioner muttered Athos as if arrested by some recollection	180.46556091308594
I know that it is terrible said DArtagnan but when I reflect that we have killed English Rochellais Spaniards nay even French who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blowsI can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman	108.83102416992188
As for me said Porthos now that you have reminded me of it Athos I have the scene again before me as if I now were there	68.90823364257812
Milady was there as it were where you sit	124.87638854980469
Athos changed color	188.99195861816406
II was where DArtagnan stands	215.6626434326172
I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascusyou remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizarde	94.23747253417969
Well I swear to you all three that had the executioner of Bethunewas he not of Bethuneyes egad of Bethunenot been there I would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it	95.80577850341797
She was a most atrocious woman	134.21304321289062
And then said Aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God what is the use of thinking of it all At the last hour we must confess this action and God knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed	350.78924560546875
I repent of it Egad no	63.98846435546875
Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a woman	545.3318481445312
The most satisfactory part of the matter said DArtagnan is that there remains no trace of it	80.70514678955078
She had a son observed Athos	190.48260498046875
Oh yes I know that said DArtagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him If the serpent be dead why not its brood Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that young viper De Winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother	515.5479125976562
Then said Athos woe to De Winter for the child had done no harm	90.1142349243164
May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porthos	57.50979232788086
There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so DArtagnan declares	50.384098052978516
Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	197.10804748535156
Come in cried Athos	1404.746337890625
Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you	140.0777130126953
To which of us asked all the four friends	22.414356231689453
To him who is called the Comte de la Fere	46.54960250854492
It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person	92.82109832763672
Ah exclaimed Athos turning pale	64.14319610595703
Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne	88.19403839111328
Let him enter cried DArtagnan let him come up	51.14126968383789
But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it	67.45824432373047
The door being closed the four friends waited in expectation	102.39623260498047
Grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news	274.4220886230469
Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware	55.13541793823242
Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile	79.68476867675781
Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife DArtagnan arose	151.38465881347656
What do you mean Grimaud he exclaimed	38.38289260864258
That Miladys son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here already	60.57835006713867
The devil he is said Porthos	112.38505554199219
Are you sure of it	217.26666259765625
Certain replied Grimaud	35.079734802246094
This announcement was received in silence	42.91434097290039
Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair	119.87252807617188
Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him	77.7780990600586
Well after all said DArtagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other such	112.85252380371094
Let him come	246.5802764892578
Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come	27.775440216064453
Moreover he is but a child said Aramis	18.381269454956055
Grimaud rose	14.197980880737305
A child he exclaimed	106.08284759521484
Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart	65.01092529296875
See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound	33.16460418701172
And Grimaud threw the dagger on the table	51.47621536254883
DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords	104.52202606201172
Athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful	56.234130859375
And you say he is dressed as a monk Grimaud	78.67181396484375
Yes as an Augustine monk	303.0008239746094
What sized man is he	82.89370727539062
About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair	30.575153350830078
And he did not see Raoul asked Athos	146.9141845703125
Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man	74.51893615722656
Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	2.000459671020508
Heigh sir said DArtagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouseevading women How is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child	34811.94921875
It is true said Athos but this child comes in the name of Heaven	31.667495727539062
And very soon they left the inn	142.60067749023438
Chapter XXXVI	75.18358612060547
A Letter from Charles the First	121.51351165771484
The reader must now cross the Seine with us and follow us to the door of the Carmelite Convent in the Rue Saint Jacques	40.42078399658203
It is eleven oclock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of King Charles I	11.687993049621582
Leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have reentered their cell	141.43380737304688
The woman kneels on a priedieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping	60.73807144165039
The woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her	102.88169860839844
The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen	182.68453979492188
Oh God prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead	37.11186981201172
Oh God murmured the girl leave me my mother	157.63966369628906
Your mother can be of no use to you in this world Henrietta said the lady turning around	31.81721305847168
Your mother has no longer either throne or husband she has neither son money nor friends the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother And she fell back weeping into her daughters arms	137.8377685546875
Courage take courage my dear mother said the girl	86.94806671142578
Ah tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother	101.3569564819336
And no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs	135.46701049804688
As long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father	31.77035903930664
I have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice	43.04344177246094
We are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of Heaven we are the poor succored by God	53.20597457885742
But why not address yourself to your sister the queen asked the girl	392.9350280761719
Alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my child	284.6153869628906
Another reigns in her name	184.24884033203125
One day you will be able to understand how all this is	92.9914779663086
Well then to the king your nephew	63.01678466796875
Shall I speak to him You know how much he loves me my mother	124.3797607421875
Alas my nephew is not yet king and you know Laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything	21.471561431884766
Then let us pray to Heaven said the girl	76.44883728027344
The two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughter of Henry IV	178.94822692871094
the wife and daughter of Charles I	57.29943084716797
They had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell	9.230905532836914
Enter my sister said the queen	46.375675201416016
I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty	82.0448989868164
Oh a letter a letter from the king perhaps	124.5553207397461
News from your father do you hear Henrietta And the name of this lord	21.742345809936523
Lord de Winter	28.510581970214844
Lord de Winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband	35.579410552978516
Oh bid him enter	95.3271713256836
And the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold	183.54083251953125
Ah my lord said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time	49.25926971435547
Gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master	167.05137634277344
De Winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion	104.67121124267578
On their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter	127.84092712402344
Dear WifeWe have now reached the moment of decision	95.55977630615234
I have concentrated here at Naseby camp all the resources Heaven has left me and I write to you in haste from thence	44.492069244384766
Here I await the army of my rebellious subjects	37.67762756347656
I am about to struggle for the last time with them	106.38024139404297
If victorious I shall continue the struggle if beaten I am lost	58.68452072143555
I shall try in the latter case alas in our position one must provide for everything I shall try to gain the coast of France	12.102603912353516
But can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord Your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	24.320415496826172
The bearer of this letter will tell you madame what I dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit	185.66929626464844
He will explain to you the steps that I expect you to pursue	60.211090087890625
I charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart	228.35623168945312
The letter bore the signature not of Charles King but of Charlesstill king	121.53060913085938
And let him be no longer king cried the queen	175.02626037597656
Let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	229.2415771484375
Alas in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it	183.4000701904297
But my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from mewhat is in truth the kings position Is it as hopeless as he thinks	10.707996368408203
Alas madame more hopeless than he thinks	296.824462890625
His majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason England is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which I greatly fear blood alone can exorcise	72.15927124023438
But Lord Montrose replied the queen I have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained	14.981064796447754
I heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king	26.8421573638916
Yes madame but on the frontier he was met by Lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	205.22427368164062
Now victory has abandoned him	153.27273559570312
Montrose beaten at Philiphaugh was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant	239.87460327148438
He is at Bergen in Norway	90.52708435058594
Heaven preserve him said the queen	260.98828125
It is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe	4015.722900390625
And now my lord that I see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband	138.86651611328125
Well then madame said De Winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him	162.5087127685547
Alas you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	61.353660583496094
Here Monsieur Mazarin is everything	11.98415470123291
Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell plays in England	85.96112060546875
Oh no He is a subtle conscienceless Italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike Cromwell who disposes of both Houses Mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament	164.59829711914062
More reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament	75.33082580566406
The queen shook her head despairingly	294.3699645996094
If I judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	59.86594009399414
The presence of my daughter and myself in France is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king	32.68252944946289
My lord added Henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the Louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire	17.370317459106445
Horrible cried De Winter the daughter of Henry IV	76.07443237304688
and the wife of King Charles Wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us	101.60989379882812
Such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it	128.2124481201172
But I heard that a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Mademoiselle dOrleans was spoken of said De Winter	47.94386672973633
Yes for an instant I hoped it was so	77.48070526123047
The young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and Monsieur the Duc dOrleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union	79.10285949707031
Oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me	297.68768310546875
Courage madame courage Do not despair The interests of the French crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation	65.1287612915039
Mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity	722.7684326171875
Are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled	118.71461486816406
By whom	122.94805145263672
By the Joices the Prinns the Cromwells	108.04353332519531
By a tailor a coachmaker a brewer Ah I hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men	168.77230834960938
Ah what is he himself asked Madame Henrietta	159.94447326660156
But for the honor of the kingof the queen	68.27063751220703
Well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen	81.60240936279297
A true friends eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me	120.39037322998047
Give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle	627.7374877929688
His majesty will then take refuge in Holland where I hear his highness the Prince of Wales now is	45.17196273803711
And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight	109.67874908447266
Alas no madame answered De Winter but the case is provided for and I am come to France to seek allies	32.74925994873047
Allies said the queen shaking her head	259.0836181640625
Madame replied De Winter provided I can find some of my good old friends of former times I will answer for anything	222.35726928710938
Come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may Heaven hear you	88.76136016845703
Chapter XXXVII	204.138671875
Cromwells Letter	154.20654296875
At the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the Palais Royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to Cardinal Mazarin	185.1812286376953
Although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible	168.89315795898438
The true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful Bernouin a Cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm	304.4696044921875
It was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory	347.2874755859375
The young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	115.44432067871094
Cardinal Mazarin said he	187.4338836669922
Pass on replied the guard	99.35099792480469
The cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	168.39361572265625
Have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival	21.742345809936523
I have one but not one from Cardinal Mazarin	41.762596130371094
Enter and ask for Monsieur Bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room	77.67806243896484
Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed	54.74855041503906
You seek me sir said he	56.514068603515625
From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence	116.68897247314453
From General Oliver Cromwell said the new comer	143.46240234375
Be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive meyes or no	135.78370666503906
Saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to Puritans	173.22430419921875
Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messengers words	37.744850158691406
A man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell said Mazarin	49.51747131347656
And what kind of a man	50.2275390625
A genuine Englishman your eminence	125.49104309082031
Hair sandyredmore red than sandy grayblue eyesmore gray than blue and for the rest stiff and proud	133.62841796875
Let him give in his letter	113.04716491699219
His eminence asks for the letter said Bernouin passing back into the antechamber	2.000459671020508
His eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that I am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that I am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary	14.671560287475586
Bernouin reentered the cabinet returning in a few seconds	40.17479705810547
Enter sir said he	164.78292846679688
The young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	250.83612060546875
Mazarin rose	110.63477325439453
Have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me	150.46141052246094
There it is my lord said the young man	198.10305786132812
Mazarin took the letter and read it thus	56.34688949584961
Mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to His Eminence the Cardinal Mazarin in Paris	177.23336791992188
He is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence	111.16883850097656
Oliver Cromwell	34.48673629760742
Very well Monsieur Mordaunt said Mazarin give me this second letter and sit down	490.76287841796875
The young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat	59.91885757446289
The cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger	84.15281677246094
You are very young Monsieur Mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail	68.6707534790039
My lord I am twentythree years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that I am young	80.06739807128906
I am older than your eminence although I possess not your wisdom	17.279043197631836
Years of suffering in my opinion count double and I have suffered for twenty years	86.48949432373047
Ah yes I understand said Mazarin want of fortune perhaps	175.5400390625
You are poor are you not Then he added to himself These English Revolutionists are all beggars and illbred	20.50670623779297
My lord I ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me	83.44097900390625
You are not then a man of the people said Mazarin astonished	81.67330169677734
If I bore my proper title I should be a lord	184.2337188720703
If I bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of England	97.6110610961914
What is your name then asked Mazarin	218.1165008544922
My name is Mordaunt replied the young man bowing	55.3729133605957
Mazarin now understood that Cromwells envoy desired to retain his incognito	568.6854858398438
He was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first	141.7772216796875
The messenger was unmoved	168.62196350097656
Devil take these Puritans said Mazarin aside they are carved from granite	49.713417053222656
Then he added aloud But you have relations left you	78.22051239013672
I have one remaining	211.71920776367188
Three times I presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away	69.59866333007812
Oh mon Dieu my dear Mr	87.96900177001953
Mordaunt said Mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me You know not then anything of your birthyou have never seen your mother	335.5085754394531
Yes my lord she came three times whilst I was a child to my nurses house I remember the last time she came as well as if it were today	148.7487030029297
You have a good memory said Mazarin	100.72209930419922
Oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	84.75606536865234
And who brought you up he asked again	241.01991271972656
A French nurse who sent me away when I was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak	66.48467254638672
What became of you	74.33595275878906
As I was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from Kingston took me in instructed me in the Calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family	120.97024536132812
And these researches	119.96842956542969
Were fruitless chance did everything	360.48443603515625
You discovered what had become of your mother	66.85630798339844
I learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but I was already aware that I had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by King Charles I	577.886962890625
Oh I now understand why you are in the service of Cromwell you hate the king	245.0733184814453
Yes my lord I hate him said the young man	259.47625732421875
Mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words	44.3025016784668
Just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	142.03125
Your history is a terrible one Mr	83.27705383300781
Mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an allpowerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information	118.67998504638672
My lord to a wellbred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other	100.13455963134766
But this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said Mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwells person	137.10182189941406
Thanks my lord I will speak to him myself	150.2091522216797
He will treat me better the next time I see him	59.64329528808594
You have the means then of touching him	149.84095764160156
I have the means of making myself feared	494.4624328613281
Mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened Cromwells letter	66.93978881835938
The young mans eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie	119.94921112060547
After reading the first lines of the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read	533.391357421875
Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying	94.23634338378906
Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter contains	543.3361206054688
We here present the letter verbatim	1123.643798828125
To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini	63.181427001953125
I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in England	72.8664321899414
The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of France	305.2936096191406
The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his adherents	94.21675109863281
Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results	52.71697235107422
I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles	26.020288467407227
I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with me	90.03314208984375
This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money	203.4805450439453
France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	54.18404769897461
But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France	88.40603637695312
As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities	66.81659698486328
At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	19.936058044433594
The latter continued in thought	82.80928802490234
Mazarin resumed his reading	105.45196533203125
It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of France	89.65870666503906
The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same	61.572593688964844
England needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch	56.7769660949707
You need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain	307.27471923828125
Your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you today and tomorrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor President Blancmesnil and Councillor Brousselall that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event England exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with Spain already seeking that alliance	53.607486724853516
I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of England	61.70724105834961
That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with troops	49.60091781616211
My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels	52.23910140991211
It anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events	71.05789947509766
Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	2.000459671020508
Farewell monseigneur should I not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days I shall presume my letter will have miscarried	609.9146728515625
Oliver Cromwell	112.88848114013672
Mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at BoulognesurMer and promise me to set out tomorrow morning	123.8451156616211
I promise my lord replied Mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply	26.641780853271484
If you do not receive it in ten days you can leave	28.758983612060547
Mordaunt bowed	65.89466094970703
That is not all sir continued Mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from Mr	83.4498519897461
Cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can I do for you	178.7842254638672
Mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered	83.20782470703125
My lord the Queen Henrietta Maria accompanied by an English noble is entering the Palais Royal at this moment	204.75587463378906
Mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make	110.6941909790039
Sir said the cardinal you have heard me I fix on Boulogne because I presume that every town in France is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as I am by influences I can only muzzle by discretion I desire your presence in Paris to be unknown	55.50914001464844
I go sir said Mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered	237.1733856201172
No not that way I beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall	38.6812858581543
I do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret	42.33470153808594
Mordaunt followed Bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out	140.80484008789062
Chapter XXXVIII	154.69725036621094
Henrietta Maria and Mazarin	119.4713134765625
The cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of England	58.953575134277344
He showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some selfreproach for his own want of heart and his avarice	182.8693084716797
But supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of Henry IV	99.03060150146484
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	17.653858184814453
Ah said Mazarin to himself what a sweet face does she come to borrow money of me	46.125343322753906
And he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome	126.88761901855469
Your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but I have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men	36.00009536743164
Madame said Mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction	84.28590393066406
He is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand	52.970916748046875
Give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants	117.85487365722656
Alas sir replied the queen I have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions	83.29595947265625
I am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard	42.80422592163086
I am listening madame with the greatest interest said Mazarin	112.8758773803711
Your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects	37.089237213134766
You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto	142.97119140625
I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me	128.97433471679688
Well then your eminence said the queen I must inform you that Charles I	465.5031433105469
my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	43.953407287597656
In case of a check Mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into France and to live here as a private individual	33.25857925415039
What do you say to this project	51.7520751953125
The cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said	424.8391418457031
Do you think madame that France agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king How will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV	99.7155990600586
support a double weight	54.85362243652344
The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and I ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir	246.3956298828125
Oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing	86.11270904541016
A daughter of Henry IV	218.42625427246094
of that great that sublime sovereign	45.16161346435547
All which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his soninlaw sir Nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from England and England accorded it to him and it is but just to say that Queen Elizabeth was not his niece	85.91539001464844
Peccato said Mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless I explain myself in French	73.95848846435547
Speak Italian sir	141.74856567382812
Ere the cardinal your predecessor sent our mother Marie de Medicis to die in exile she taught us that language	74.10417938232422
If anything yet remains of that great that sublime king Henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself	18.93845558166504
The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarins brow	88.79649353027344
That admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned Mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king Charles I	65.89032745361328
whom Heaven protect from evilcame into France I would offer him my housemy own house but alas it would be but an unsafe retreat	165.4580078125
Some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the Marechal dAncre	200.16831970214844
Poor Concino Concini And yet he but desired the good of the people	128.5315704345703
Yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically	73.01627349853516
Mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini	54.6170539855957
Well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer	63.60198211669922
Madame cried Mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel	35.16505813598633
Speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available	182.5856170654297
Madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last	31.20723533630371
He has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten	116.86392211914062
Well madame in that case my adviceI know that I am very bold to offer advice to your majestymy advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom	49.841468811035156
Absent kings are very soon forgotten if he passes over into France his cause is lost	34.87543869018555
But persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for I can do nothing for him I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him	31.415019989013672
If I had had a single ornament left I should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself	36.998470306396484
Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	27.394075393676758
On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects	38.05846405029297
To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality What do you intend to do Speak	11.06274700164795
Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	57.55129623413086
After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf	72.41835021972656
The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair	5.313624382019043
Well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak	123.5268783569336
I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament	240.328125
With which you are at waris it not so You will charge Broussel to report it	128.07435607910156
Enough sir enough	56.50582504272461
I understand you or rather I am wrong	194.21563720703125
Go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime Henry IV	31.530433654785156
whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold	60.92168045043945
And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed Ah madame madame how little you know me mon Dieu	67.52843475341797
But Queen Henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinals numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of De Winter who stood apart in isolation	83.43003845214844
Poor queen already fallen Though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean	29.169939041137695
It signifies little said Mazarin when he was alone	67.61642456054688
It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but I have said nothing either to the one or to the other	5.15980339050293
Bernouin entered	87.03754425048828
See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace	125.662353515625
Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on guard	165.39712524414062
Your eminence said Comminges as I was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the door	66.87531280517578
He reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	98.9620132446289
I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	299.5697326660156
But is not your eminence going to the queen	98.1899642944336
For what purpose	87.81661224365234
Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army	14.388839721679688
It is well I will go	29.596799850463867
Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt had really acted as he had related	20.310575485229492
In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation	42.964637756347656
At this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of Raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	56.08951950073242
His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	15.926636695861816
One would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if Comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De Winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was his eternal foe	93.7419204711914
But he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queens carriage had left the court	146.8115234375
He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	84.02093505859375
At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	445.9812927246094
The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they entered	12.27125358581543
Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites Henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	105.57080841064453
Mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of Jean Goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	20.31317710876465
Chapter XXXIX	113.38712310791016
How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence	121.0676040649414
Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants	263.1102600097656
Well my lord what I foresaw has come to pass	31.436779022216797
What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince Ay but it is for the first time madame	9.141561508178711
I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a Frenchman	55.93941116333008
But did you see the queen	89.8310775756836
It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no	59.34511184692383
Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Cromwell	281.8536376953125
He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse	164.94180297851562
Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord	268.9834289550781
Not from England madame	50.34272003173828
I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forestalled	240.47988891601562
I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris	84.4178695678711
Besides the king I am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking anything	182.1634063720703
You will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that I can do nothing that I have suffered as much as himselfmore than he hasobliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king	168.7097930908203
I shall go and die by his side	78.8112564086914
Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope	44.40140914916992
No friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself Oh God exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to Heaven have You indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world	210.1185760498047
I hope not madame replied De Winter thoughtfully I once spoke to you of four men	23.225101470947266
What can be done with four	165.8451385498047
Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one time	2.000459671020508
And where are these four men	341.97442626953125
Ah that is what I do not know	130.74783325195312
It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of them	33.66727066040039
And these men were your friends	129.50770568847656
One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me	154.2694854736328
I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained his	19.167713165283203
And these men are in France my lord	116.34744262695312
I believe so	6.245054244995117
Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them	25.878690719604492
One of them was called the Chevalier dArtagnan	66.46780395507812
Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier dArtagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal	171.72044372558594
That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really doomed	93.14605712890625
But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel	198.1917724609375
The others my lord	101.76535034179688
The secondI heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la Fere	69.80693054199219
As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real ones	54.49101638793945
Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king	42.173858642578125
Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same men	34.922943115234375
Listen madame and recall your remembrances	53.11527633666992
Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen	94.18046569824219
Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds	108.80270385742188
Well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and I smile with pity when I reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm	59.02882385253906
Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor I tell you you must not count on Monsieur dArtagnan	57.2520751953125
It will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever Mazarin may say once on the shores of France your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm	50.22043991088867
Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave Whitehall	96.71004486083984
Seek them my lord and find them I conjure you	38.46567153930664
I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails me	21.83954620361328
Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony	121.56155395507812
Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart	46.92427444458008
At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the subject	38.583229064941406
But that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess	126.280029296875
She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen	171.35113525390625
Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she said	59.04267120361328
The queen smiled but instead of answering	57.4619026184082
See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame	75.21894073486328
Then turning toward her daughter	188.4446563720703
What do you want Henrietta she demanded	144.6238555908203
My mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the Louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the Marechal de Grammont I think	186.77703857421875
Ah said the queen to De Winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper	214.60369873046875
Madame have pity on me exclaimed De Winter you wring my heart	117.98178100585938
And who is this cavalier Henrietta asked the queen	70.23054504394531
I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragelonne	105.91140747070312
The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the threshold	50.80693435668945
Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down	87.46753692626953
Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect	109.65997314453125
At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity	52.80767059326172
You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the queen	37.88611602783203
I thought so madame stammered the young girl	124.5435562133789
It is my fault madame said Raoul	48.54720687866211
I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his secretary	586.5783081054688
There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to rise	148.8043212890625
Yes madame said the young man	137.2472381591797
At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks	161.6577911376953
The queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing Raoul again	100.19779968261719
And no evil has happened to the young Count de Guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but morehe is one of our friends	46.434234619140625
No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle	79.82273864746094
The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	43.186222076416016
Let us see said the queen what the count says	33.1004524230957
And she opened the letter and read	42.94965744018555
MadameBeing unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound I have received in my right hand I have commanded my son the Count de Guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of Lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to Cardinal Mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of Europe	68.6768798828125
If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of France	132.26539611816406
The Vicomte de Bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me	117.25951385498047
I have the honor to be with respect etc	67.07977294921875
Marechal de Grammont	320.6946105957031
At the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man he no longer doubted that the daughter of King Charles I	109.114013671875
loved his friend	2.000459671020508
The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm them	197.07054138183594
This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all Paris	73.00770568847656
Madame said Raoul the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my guardian	170.6722869873047
Your guardian is he too a Bragelonne asked Lord de Winter	87.9244613647461
I once knew a Bragelonneis he still alive	286.2150573730469
No sir he is dead and I believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which I take my name	49.446006774902344
And your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name	347.5881652832031
The Comte de la Fere madame replied the young man bowing	13.472140312194824
De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	48.45305633544922
The Comte de la Fere she cried	338.0484619140625
Have you not mentioned that name to me	31.16956329345703
As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright	56.773956298828125
The Comte de la Fere he cried in his turn	20.856077194213867
Oh sir reply I entreat youis not the Comte de la Fere a noble whom I remember handsome and brave a musketeer under Louis XIII	43.83161544799805
who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age	82.0743637084961
Yes sir you are right in every particular	138.08860778808594
And who served under an assumed name	69.25645446777344
Under the name of Athos	81.0672836303711
Latterly I heard his friend Monsieur dArtagnan give him that name	362.3421936035156
That is it madame that is the same	126.2958755493164
God be praised And he is in Paris continued he addressing Raoul then turning to the queen We may still hope	124.57379150390625
Providence has declared for us since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner	16.482995986938477
And sir where does he reside pray	30.793292999267578
The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud Hotel du Grand Roi Charlemagne	72.41651916503906
Thanks sir	64.05645751953125
Inform this dear friend that he may remain within that I shall go and see him immediately	109.60069274902344
Sir I obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart	149.12893676757812
Go Monsieur de Bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection	39.317134857177734
Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to De Winter departed	76.98821258544922
The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	252.59896850585938
Then when De Winter rose to take leave	117.20149230957031
Listen my lord said the queen I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of St	47.697391510009766
Michael which came from my husband	99.66658782958984
They are worth about fifty thousand pounds	112.01317596435547
I had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	60.49579620361328
Take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord	41.52138900756836
But should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that I shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children	116.19009399414062
Madame replied De Winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	106.51734161376953
I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess	14.184961318969727
In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite reply	63.908390045166016
The queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	45.03163146972656
Chapter XL	26.336305618286133
Uncle and Nephew	16.30298614501953
The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Louvre	64.00308227539062
It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance	78.92882537841797
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow	40.83222198486328
Tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	110.56922149658203
Here I am my lord	122.19245910644531
Did you remark that man who is following us	43.922325134277344
Yes my lord	66.66663360595703
Who is he	71.10965728759766
I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with you	4638.7294921875
Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him aside	185.19412231445312
Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us	93.05136108398438
And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	108.19097900390625
The unknown spurred his horse to a gallop	45.84807205200195
De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room	133.58949279785156
He turned around and Mordaunt stood before him	44.23041534423828
There was a moment of frozen silence between these two	128.90283203125
Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in London	150.98233032226562
I am not your uncle I know you not	123.5162124633789
My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in Londonyou dare not	33.417755126953125
As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year ago	24.1268367767334
And how does it concern me what you have learned said De Winter	26.517580032348633
Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed	91.74403381347656
When I presented myself before you for the first time in London it was to ask you what had become of my fortune the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name and this time I come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as God said to the first murderer Cain what hast thou done to thy brother Abel My lord what have you done with your sisteryour sister who was my mother	121.87525939941406
De Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes	258.2442932128906
Your mother he said	63.028865814208984
Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his arms	50.824649810791016
I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief	489.07757568359375
And the headsman of Bethune gave me a reply	72.53408813476562
De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply	406.3092041015625
Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the abyss	58.79966735839844
My mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune	28.86542320251465
I am no longer astonished that you knew me not	72.69974517822266
I am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	145.16748046875
When a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan	33.421356201171875
These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had anticipated	139.99984741210938
De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man	51.542972564697266
You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be it	165.5917205810547
Know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to account	103.85765075683594
That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	78.67259979248047
I have proof of it	102.76603698730469
What say you to that	87.61810302734375
I say that she was my mother	212.4521026611328
She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure	96.91741180419922
What say you to that crime of which I have the proof	78.8243408203125
She was my mother	41.47853469848633
On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune	19.329227447509766
Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this I have the proofs	171.25770568847656
She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force	58.64051818847656
At last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you sawthat executioner who you say told you everythingthat executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brothers shame and suicide	74.3228759765625
Depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by Heaven and earth	90.6545181274414
A sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like Hamlets stood on end and racked with fury he cried out	56.48564529418945
Silence sir she was my mother Her crimes I know them not her disorders I know them not her vices I know them not	181.54893493652344
But this I know that I had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by nightsilentlylike cowards	30.12862205505371
I know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others She must die	51.06231689453125
Therefore I warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everythingthis murder which has deprived me of my namethis murder which has impoverished methis murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacableI shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when I discover them	70.50814056396484
With hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended Mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward De Winter	92.37478637695312
The latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death	63.10636520385742
Would you assassinate me sir Then I shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother	55.281314849853516
No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the others	46.64105224609375
But when I have found them then tremble sir	82.24681854248047
I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all	190.37136840820312
With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	359.2139892578125
But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying	44.27927017211914
My God I thank Thee that he knows me only	92.94183349609375
Chapter XLI	198.01730346679688
Paternal Affection	126.91847229003906
Whilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winters Athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to Raouls account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle	114.31256103515625
Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	96.78218841552734
He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future	114.78218841552734
It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes	272.4623718261719
Athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	28.92012596130371
And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musketeer	205.48641967773438
Yes sir	30.32135772705078
And it was a fierce one	52.934696197509766
His highness the prince charged eleven times in person	255.48989868164062
He is a great commander Bragelonne	62.995513916015625
He is a hero sir	737.872314453125
I did not lose sight of him for an instant	136.15261840820312
Oh how fine it is to be called Cond and to be so worthy of such a name	396.41815185546875
He was calm and radiant was he not	47.5394401550293
As calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	73.6409683227539
When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets	56.18141174316406
When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those fellows	97.85922241210938
There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he cried	53.66611862182617
Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul	107.67810821533203
I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand	254.9464111328125
Were you afraid Raoul asked the count	523.7122802734375
Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemys ranks I closed my eyes and thought of you	134.5889129638672
In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his hand	172.67391967773438
Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened	35.51327896118164
Those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames	55.15390396118164
I opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying	70.91194152832031
At that moment I encountered the eye of the prince	28.741907119750977
I had but one thought and that was that he was observing me	61.37710189819336
I spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks	24.523513793945312
And the prince was pleased with you	96.37687683105469
He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	79.02625274658203
Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your service	67.521484375
Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of you	110.84737396240234
And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me again	35.145408630371094
Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter	56.46894836425781
And now Raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of France for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice	40.16991424560547
Oh sir said Raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits I had forgotten it is that there was with Her Majesty the Queen of England a gentleman who when I pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you	30.38147735595703
What is his name	52.286521911621094
I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an Englishman	41.41498947143555
Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be	112.59768676757812
Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air	74.18383026123047
Lord de Winter exclaimed the count	51.04359817504883
Athos my friend	32.20262908935547
And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each others arms then Athos looking into his friends face and taking him by both hands said	75.0084457397461
What ails you my lord you appear as unhappy as I am the reverse	115.02671813964844
Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my dismay	36.27705001831055
And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	23.94814109802246
Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of yourself	35.73200988769531
Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De Winter	61.50856018066406
He is here	153.31871032714844
Miladys son	451.1914367675781
Athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said	130.5918731689453
I know it Grimaud met him between Bethune and Arras and then came here to warn me of his presence	33.79207229614258
Does Grimaud know him then	28.79332733154297
No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him	56.905818939208984
The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De Winter	68.16803741455078
You know about that cried Athos astonished	2.000459671020508
He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me all	393.6361999511719
Ah my friend what a horrible scene Why did we not destroy the child with the mother	46.723358154296875
What need you fear said Athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves Is this young man an assassin by professiona murderer in cold blood He has killed the executioner of Bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged	545.3427734375
De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head	64.16482543945312
Do you not know the race said he	220.70558166503906
Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his turn	159.59068298339844
It must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	109.64214324951172
Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our guard	30.682559967041016
All we can now do is to wait	50.191253662109375
Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of yourself	6.464415550231934
What brings you to Paris	131.82647705078125
Affairs of importance which you shall know later	91.33002471923828
But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear friend	26.812002182006836
I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me	216.72158813476562
But do you happen to belong to him	27.781356811523438
Monsieur dArtagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	28.80657958984375
Monsieur dArtagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live	28.676729202270508
Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in France	66.61233520507812
Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer	18.901893615722656
But to return to our subject	19.84855842590332
Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarins party No	99.34413146972656
Pardon my frankness too my lord	51.53975296020508
I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by it	192.62991333007812
Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to him	91.50334930419922
But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married	44.569210052490234
Ah as to that no replied Athos laughing	62.47932815551758
Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished	275.5284729003906
Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his father	93.99297332763672
Very well you are always the same Athos great and generous	64.0694351196289
Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis	68.17375946044922
Add Monsieur dArtagnan my lord	96.0651626586914
We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only two	85.02367401123047
Is Monsieur Aramis with DArtagnan asked Lord de Winter	377.7196044921875
No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my opinions	145.35269165039062
Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed	160.22853088378906
He has become an abb that is all	88.26834106445312
You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings	47.4681396484375
On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abb and you will find him a veritable soldier	155.13258361816406
Could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the Pont du Louvre	114.83736419677734
Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in prospect	162.3466796875
Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your part	123.1982192993164
Where are we to go my lord	183.8898468017578
To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to her	34.27064514160156
This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no further	46.124210357666016
Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me	23.265474319458008
Thanks count no replied De Winter	48.7176513671875
I own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep	492.2210388183594
What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey	44.07185745239258
This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition	89.34595489501953
What occupies him in England	68.93498229980469
He is one of Cromwells most enthusiastic disciples	174.28297424316406
But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe	31.337879180908203
His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De Winter	59.14335250854492
And what name does he now bear	155.46157836914062
A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in France	153.39059448242188
Do you say as a monk	127.01371765136719
It was thus and by mere accidentmay God pardon me if I blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of Bethune	403.3626403808594
Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled	95.62066650390625
Everything is clear to me now	86.4419174194336
Adieu count till tomorrow	96.65374755859375
But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no servant	25.0738468170166
I have Tony a safe if simple youth	47.19230651855469
Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with you	32.12199783325195
Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his province	25.066818237304688
Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him	42.59575271606445
Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me	22.73555564880371
For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the way	48.44366455078125
De Winter shook him by the hand	34.33857727050781
Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk	25.372058868408203
Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	172.87179565429688
Then obeying the orders given him by Athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached De Winters inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word	42.11600112915039
The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Quai	97.39157104492188
He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	169.4284210205078
He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	107.02320861816406
The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bedside	111.6899642944336
The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M	183.40480041503906
Already up Raoul exclaimed the count	122.12157440185547
Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep well	60.05012130737305
You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Athos	140.5425567626953
Sir you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you when I have only just arrived but	46.853172302246094
Have you only two days of leave Raoul	350.99017333984375
On the contrary sir I have ten nor is it to the camp I wish to go	505.193603515625
Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a secret	98.27714538574219
You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me	155.7381134033203
Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me	95.64899444580078
I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Blois	53.15717315673828
You look at me and you are going to laugh at me	28.539987564086914
No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a sigh	33.29328155517578
You wish to see Blois again it is but natural	59.19596862792969
Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joyously	89.90204620361328
Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure	139.22023010253906
Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and I can set out immediately	197.90194702148438
When you like Raoul	179.73936462402344
Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the prince	53.207115173339844
And you ought to thank her Raoul	52.78297424316406
Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	78.98333740234375
I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world	59.276329040527344
You must take Grimaud and Olivain	95.84069061279297
Both sir asked Raoul astonished	115.58373260498047
Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he sighed	127.99164581298828
It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	159.2205810546875
Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind	78.92604064941406
He certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her	204.30343627929688
And Athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian	107.18157196044922
Everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevreuse	19.50159454345703
He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations	475.75823974609375
Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes	23.623729705810547
Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment	213.94650268554688
Chapter XLII	134.79257202148438
Another Queen in Want of Help	59.43238830566406
Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	154.06277465820312
Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at Notre Dame	10.35521125793457
Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself	75.16838836669922
Blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the Abb dHerblay and in spite of Bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put Bazin into a passion	86.81321716308594
Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian charity	64.61016082763672
But Bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois saying	113.1450424194336
You have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church	45.437286376953125
At this moment Aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and Blaisois looking reproachfully at the Cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis	104.5694351196289
From the Comte de la Fere said Aramis	89.46673583984375
All right	177.7042999267578
And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	123.06153869628906
Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure	45.14268493652344
You foolish fellow said Athos laughing	23.294992446899414
And you did not tell him that you came from me	92.05147552490234
No sir	2738.431640625
At ten oclock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter	111.89739227294922
They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join them	141.71084594726562
Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abb cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aramis	87.6015625
It was indeed Aramis	52.30791091918945
Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces	192.99179077148438
At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	176.6667022705078
A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de Winter	103.95891571044922
Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one	106.8696517944336
No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of England	45.6168327331543
Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued he	103.45283508300781
Nay I know not some evidence required from us perhaps	143.96705627441406
May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them myself	41.52212905883789
If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us	89.85725402832031
You re right yes let us go	194.96463012695312
On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	74.96049499511719
It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos Aramis and even the Englishman	109.72870635986328
Large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of Athos to which he touching his companions elbow directed his attention by his glances	199.99916076660156
Mazarin is better lodged said Aramis	213.97750854492188
Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer queen	112.02134704589844
If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Voiture	117.6971206665039
Athos smiled	36.09362030029297
The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Misfortune	91.27300262451172
You are welcome gentlemen she said	37.26842498779297
The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves	174.41542053222656
Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	68.67671203613281
You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her	73.3656234741211
Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry IV	97.03662109375
is treated at the court of France	111.01235961914062
Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de Winter	3660.491943359375
That gentleman is the Abb dHerblay replied he	66.26738739013672
Aramis blushed	101.69801330566406
Madame he said I am an abb it is true but I am so against my will	107.40412902832031
I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once more	24.904067993164062
This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use me	73.86185455322266
The Abb dHerblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII	49.191131591796875
of whom I have spoken to you madame	77.22535705566406
Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty	320.0335693359375
Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	49.98753356933594
Today look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord de Winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom I see for the first time and whom I know but as my countrymen	52.85285186767578
It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame	92.14453125
I thank you gentlemen	228.0623016357422
But hear me continued she	154.2400665283203
I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives	430.41925048828125
My children two of them at least the Duke of York and the Princess Elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in England so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired	62.82931900024414
Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de Winter	76.88042449951172
Read it	375.056396484375
Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded him	57.86325454711914
Well asked Athos when he had closed the letter	171.48313903808594
Well said the queen it has been refused	76.48931884765625
The two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	218.33042907714844
And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dHerblay and myself to do in your service	92.09568786621094
We are ready	142.6866455078125
Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them	85.87283325195312
But you sir said the queen to Aramis	330.3645324707031
I madame replied he follow Monsieur de la Fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days I precede the count	186.26022338867188
Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	30.166645050048828
The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotchman	126.96490478515625
Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sirs	274.4120178222656
I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request it	155.07066345214844
Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every day	81.74339294433594
And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promisenot to reward you I believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one	5.008423328399658
I swear it before Heaven	7.7858099937438965
And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward	34.77457046508789
Madame said Athos when must we set out	5.262969493865967
You consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully	204.61004638671875
Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	58.03288650512695
We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous	92.58610534667969
Madame we are yours body and soul	57.515193939208984
Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope	35.73516082763672
God who can read my heart all the gratitude I feel will reward you Save my husband Save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when I may be able to thank you myself	10.33967399597168
In the meantime I remain here	98.21688842773438
Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in yours	71.15384674072266
Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majestys prayers	8.21365737915039
And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve	61.92184829711914
The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter	182.60963439941406
If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew	560.6834106445312
You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings	35.97346496582031
The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henrietta	81.55873107910156
Both were addressed to King Charles	64.6228256225586
She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew	58.28881072998047
At the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped	67.72559356689453
Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint Denis	78.02478790283203
We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post	8.18709659576416
Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queens	13.146076202392578
The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining together	81.07234191894531
Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count	82.47601318359375
Bad replied Athos very bad	2.000459671020508
But you received it with enthusiasm	124.90593719482422
As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear DHerblay	66.3695297241211
Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs	110.35726928710938
Let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves	140.83331298828125
We shall be murdered there said Aramis	75.25736236572266
I hate the Englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills beer	117.90563201904297
Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort Ifaith Aramis believe me there is little left to regret	176.41372680664062
We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy	110.96995544433594
It is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one I admit but very necessaryhave you any money	202.3792724609375
Something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before I left Bragelonne but out of that sum I ought to leave fifty for Raoula young man must live respectably	53.876853942871094
I have then about fifty pistoles	177.2130889892578
And you	92.57471466064453
As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at home	103.7625961303711
Fortunately Lord de Winter is rich	90.42552947998047
Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources	136.12632751464844
Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful	55.80484390258789
Now it is that I regret DArtagnan	142.2043914794922
Let us entice them away	389.48455810546875
This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence	57.67913055419922
And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	64.2069091796875
Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it	57.306785583496094
You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to postpone	60.2193603515625
And what are they	146.83148193359375
First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillets and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting me	139.5797576904297
Oh fiea quarrel between priests a duel between allies	34.0106315612793
What can I do friend he is a bully and so am I his cassock is a burden to him and I imagine I have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that I sometimes believe he is Aramis and I am the coadjutor	78.96376037597656
This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party	79.7674560546875
I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things	54.10719680786133
And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retzs appearance	28.713275909423828
Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of England	14.443925857543945
So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first	33.69973373413086
Oh that is of the first importance	112.44402313232422
Attend to it then at once	34.272457122802734
Unfortunately it is a thing that I ca nt perform at any time I choose	57.94390869140625
It was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve	14.44845962524414
I understand said Athos smiling midnight	170.88531494140625
About that time	166.13616943359375
But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return	98.939697265625
Yes if I return	66.77452087402344
If you do not return how does it concern you Be reasonable	46.9732780456543
Come you are no longer twenty years old	154.68470764160156
To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old	62.861473083496094
Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must part	32.929622650146484
I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write	123.31254577636719
Call for me at eight oclock or shall I wait supper for you at seven	103.38133239746094
That will do very well said Aramis	298.5758972167969
I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write	82.42581176757812
They then separated	290.29119873046875
Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuses and wrote the following letter to DArtagnan	47.62362289428711
Dear FriendI am about to set off with Aramis on important business	4119.4814453125
I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit	72.2550277709961
Remember that I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still cherish	131.83425903320312
Raoul is gone to Blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at Blois of which I send you now the key	144.23626708984375
Embrace Porthos from Aramis and myself	82.65436553955078
Adieu perhaps farewell	39.05836868286133
At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	185.44110107421875
Bythebye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and DArtagnan	261.53033447265625
The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself	89.20271301269531
You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of everything	79.48451232910156
Well have you made up your mind to this journey	130.3522186279297
Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this moment	6.043705940246582
And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen DArtagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project	114.35149383544922
When supper was over Blaisois entered	330.18499755859375
Sir said he here is Monsieur dArtagnans answer	1344.0638427734375
But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Athos	106.91313171386719
And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle	4.9044413566589355
Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms	273.525634765625
My dear CountWhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money	36.76948928833008
Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin sweat	82.7466812133789
Do nt make a bad use of it I entreat you	161.7982177734375
As to what you say about not seeing you again I believe not a word of it with such a heart as yoursand such a swordone passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed	107.06945037841797
Au revoir not farewell	35.3969841003418
It is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved him nevertheless believe that I heartily pray that I may not become to him a father however much I might be proud of such a son	104.46577453613281
Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for youfor you as Aramis	95.2252197265625
Athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	35.07738494873047
DArtagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a Mazarinist	31.338327407836914
There are the fifty louis ifaith said Aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of Louis XIII	43.839759826660156
Well what shall you do with this money count Shall you keep it or send it back	181.11090087890625
I shall keep it Aramis and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it	158.6456756591797
What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously	108.85786437988281
Take twentyfive of them Aramis and give me the remaining twentyfive	53.85293197631836
All right I am glad to see you are of my opinion	59.13477325439453
There now shall we start	64.33670043945312
When you like but have you no groom	150.17979431152344
No that idiot Bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore can not leave Notre Dame	61.55354309082031
Very well take Blaisois with whom I know not what to do since I already have Grimaud	528.1964721679688
Willingly said Aramis	91.36034393310547
At this moment Grimaud appeared at the door	129.436279296875
Ready said he with his usual curtness	51.087158203125
Let us go then said Athos	9.945690155029297
The two friends mounted as did their servants	90.88633728027344
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breathlessly	32.17150115966797
Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in time	132.22698974609375
Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left	93.90100860595703
Good said Aramis taking a purse which Bazin presented to him	1423.00244140625
What is this	117.39781188964844
Wait your reverence there is a letter	36.47942352294922
You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your body	97.19634246826172
Give me the letter	132.459716796875
How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold oven	99.06167602539062
Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church candles	57.149166107177734
Thus illumined Aramis read the following epistle	30.038349151611328
My dear DHerblayI learned from DArtagnan who has embraced me on the part of the Comte de la Fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as I know that you do not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own accord	53.71120071411133
Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs	59.467681884765625
Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in gold	188.48635864257812
So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger sum	87.6568832397461
I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same time	61.788917541503906
I am as I trust you do not doubt your devoted	67.20735931396484
Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	49.0232048034668
Well said Aramis what do you say to that	163.1002655029297
I say my dear DHerblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust Providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from Porthos as we divided the louis sent by DArtagnan	158.6511993408203
The division being made by the light of Bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint Denis	138.94110107421875
Chapter XLIII	265.239501953125
In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best	101.66287231445312
The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth	232.70762634277344
If Mousqueton were with us observed Athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this Do you remember Aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound	153.0059051513672
By my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied Aramis for even I feel a shudder at the recollection hold just above that tree is the little spot where I thought I was killed	133.80050659179688
It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past	91.58406066894531
Arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached Athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar	75.91111755371094
Athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person	54.30674743652344
At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather	42.22098159790039
Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	56.427120208740234
Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Parislet us separate to avoid suspicion	44.85757827758789
I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me	302.40875244140625
I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to LEpee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there	59.60056686401367
The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	365.1378173828125
Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one	2.000459671020508
It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud	37.92313003540039
Athos and Aramis walked down toward the port	80.2303237915039
From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders	308.1617126464844
There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression	329.5086669921875
This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	80.34510040283203
From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them	128.64837646484375
On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start	98.74282836914062
That is doubtless our boat said Athos	43.62006378173828
Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us waiting	56.08882522583008
It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing	217.02406311035156
Hush said Athos we are overheard	1092.6187744140625
In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	270.79412841796875
Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulogne	39.11122512817383
We come from Paris yes replied Athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you	115.13662719726562
Sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that Cardinal Mazarin is no longer minister	38.66999053955078
That is a strange question said Aramis	83.90106964111328
He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time	193.3302001953125
However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison	300.3984069824219
No sir not at this moment at least	168.24961853027344
Sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	147.09251403808594
What do you think of that interrogator asked Aramis	89.80953979492188
I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information	67.39676666259766
And you replied to him with that notion	84.66905975341797
Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to him	78.66761016845703
But if he be a spy	176.842529296875
What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion	197.81195068359375
It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	41.11359786987305
And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winters name	33.72066879272461
Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped	52.713226318359375
More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business	17.984296798706055
A quarrel asked Athos	117.42698669433594
And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel	95.8901138305664
I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it	272.1451721191406
Besides let me own something to you	53.625064849853516
I am anxious to see that young man nearer	94.62091827392578
And wherefore	71.094970703125
Aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that I am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man	23.894695281982422
In beauty or on the contrary asked Aramis laughing	45.77468490600586
In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman	137.01026916503906
Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me thinking	215.66831970214844
No in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now I think of ityouyes ifaith you re rightthose delicate yet firmset lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart Yes it is one of Miladys bastards	138.3800811767578
You laugh Aramis	213.48150634765625
From habit that is all	74.47726440429688
I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path	344.64111328125
Ah here is De Winter coming said Athos	73.96836853027344
Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting	62.93228530883789
No said Athos	138.36932373046875
I see them about twenty paces behind my lord	54.799659729003906
I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	1050.83837890625
Tony carries our muskets	46.42007827758789
Then we set sail tonight asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished	29.360013961791992
Probably said Athos	123.1238784790039
Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of Noisy	92.43855285644531
Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De Winter	87.01547241210938
What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dantes damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels	54.69377899169922
What the devil makes him glower thus behind him	3.2221617698669434
When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity	32.67873764038086
What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus	76.6785888671875
Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round	364.59375
Athos glanced at Aramis	170.6754608154297
But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchordo you see it there I wish I were on board already and he looked back again	48.85622024536133
He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aramis	24.537931442260742
They had reached the ladder which led to the boat	27.272817611694336
De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them	37.663536071777344
At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking	189.4945068359375
He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	31.36551284790039
Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man	59.67458724975586
The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice	49.24324417114258
He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him come	46.33107376098633
And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers	36.3436164855957
But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat	64.0190200805664
She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out	279.2787170410156
They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed	30.165687561035156
Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy	122.22188568115234
Which is the young man asked De Winter turning around	49.058746337890625
He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold	389.37054443359375
De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramiss finger	48.98189163208008
The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms	415.5270690917969
It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not mistaken	109.03453826904297
Whom do you mean asked Aramis	57.241729736328125
Miladys son replied Athos	314.04852294921875
The monk exclaimed Grimaud	103.53401184082031
The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it	144.27197265625
Yes it is I my uncleI the son of MiladyI the monkI the secretary and friend of CromwellI know you now both you and your companions	152.78945922851562
In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	109.7219467163086
As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	143.49879455566406
Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says himself	111.15425872802734
Alas yes murmured De Winter	84.03559875488281
Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock	150.11993408203125
Fire cried Grimaud unconsciously	152.53924560546875
Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired	893.643310546875
The devil take you said Aramis	586.6952514648438
I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his breast	118.65055847167969
It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarsely	71.84440612792969
The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us	93.40245819091797
Yes but the son has done us no harm	47.75757598876953
Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands	31.460922241210938
The young man burst into a laugh	93.98208618164062
Ah it is certainly you he cried	205.40060424804688
I know you even better now	164.52415466308594
His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon	64.34391021728516
Aramis shuddered	324.6645812988281
Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heavens sake have we ceased to be men	233.9482879638672
No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew	74.80484771728516
De Winter only replied by a groan	48.4252815246582
It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly	99.53782653808594
Athos took Lord de Winters hand and tried to turn the conversation	32.78841781616211
When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply	35.711212158203125
Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet time	37.675086975097656
See if he is still in the same place	158.3557586669922
Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	34.1849479675293
Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you fire	128.08084106445312
Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible	27.035017013549805
At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	53.51641082763672
The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to disembark	51.33515167236328
At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still	160.3466796875
Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in England	64.22029113769531
Chapter XLIV	81.40156555175781
Te Deum for the Victory of Lens	126.05316925048828
The bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of Lens announced by the princes messenger the Duc de Chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the Lorraine party as well as from the Spaniards upon the arches of Notre Dame	61.880611419677734
Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament	162.853515625
The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy	152.5795440673828
Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one	550.18896484375
And this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed Ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now Upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own	117.60153198242188
A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on	538.3094482421875
It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of Lens	60.7016487121582
The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect	149.56504821777344
The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence	90.9148178100586
Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum	238.21726989746094
The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips	113.39154815673828
Nevertheless at eight oclock in the morning the regiment of the queens guards commanded by Guitant under whom was his nephew Comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame a manoeuvre which the Parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms	89.39275360107422
Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Bazin	9.704483032226562
On leaving Bazin Friquet started off to the Palais Royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	119.49803161621094
This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of Notre Dame and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe near the Rue Cocatrix in which Broussel lived then Friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the cost of this repast	340.9839172363281
In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked violently	2068.731201171875
His mother the councillors old servant opened it	132.81788635253906
What doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at Notre Dame	54.02779006958008
I have been there mother said Friquet but I saw things happen of which Master Broussel ought to be warned and so with Monsieur Bazins permissionyou know mother Monsieur Bazin the vergerI came to speak to Monsieur Broussel	53.567012786865234
And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel	27.944215774536133
I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	91.37781524658203
And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his guard	455.6407165527344
Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second	155.07156372070312
Well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance Knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by	19.53236961364746
Friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said	39.241477966308594
It is not astonishing for you to know it Monsieur Broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth I did not know it and I thought I would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that Monsieur Broussel	98.99703216552734
On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your zeal	57.90358352661133
Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread	67.58866882324219
Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots	62.9349250793457
Broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oclock	161.23321533203125
The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre Dame	81.27005004882812
This noise redoubled when DArtagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the church	190.9077911376953
He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as DArtagnan had so often done formerly	113.27536010742188
The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Trville	65.86148834228516
Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration	132.0133514404297
At ten oclock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard	240.78683471679688
At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot	224.58990478515625
Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court	185.23837280273438
God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	72.2184829711914
Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely deserted	76.3539047241211
When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one	247.05210876464844
All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	97.50820922851562
Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre Dame	39.22441482543945
Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty	187.28244018554688
Toward the end of the service the queen seeing Comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the Louvre said in a whisper	49.2265625
Go Comminges and may God aid you	140.7342987060547
Comminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint Christophe	156.0470428466797
Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	71.52828216552734
Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussels door	99.28157043457031
Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be opened	46.180511474609375
What dost thou there rascal asked Comminges	33.06788635253906
I want to go into Master Broussels house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when necessary	149.65037536621094
And on what floor does he live asked Comminges	198.49632263183594
In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon	233.36602783203125
Good said Comminges	113.51256561279297
At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner	27.92646026611328
Broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son Louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councilloran accident from which he had quite recoveredat the bottom of the table	35.03004837036133
The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to him	235.3474578857422
At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also	137.4522247314453
Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself	36.00893783569336
Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the king	112.34075164794922
Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his hand	89.10285186767578
I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me	375.39849853515625
A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	76.39771270751953
It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king	59.64995193481445
Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room but a glance from the worthy Broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair	88.15910339355469
Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers arms	45.99271011352539
Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the king	94.92469787597656
Sir said Broussel I am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state I must have time	244.47267150878906
It is impossible said Comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant	73.43428802490234
Impossible said Louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair	59.611026763916016
Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room	55.30715560913086
Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand	5.421533107757568
My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Broussel	102.43364715576172
Me keep quiet while my master is being arrested he the support the liberator the father of the people Ah well yes you have to know me yet	57.33961486816406
Are you going added she to Comminges	65.94309997558594
The latter smiled	81.0460205078125
Come sir said he addressing Broussel silence that woman and follow me	154.21470642089844
Silence me me me said Nanette	1018.2748413085938
Ah yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine kings cockatoo You shall see	182.39747619628906
And Dame Nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame	118.06378173828125
Help she screamed my master is being arrested the Councillor Broussel is being arrested Help	228.4075164794922
Sir said Comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king	76.39253997802734
I obey I obey sir cried Broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority	83.94808959960938
In that case commanded Comminges silence that old woman	33.88661575317383
Ah old woman screamed Nanette	373.71746826171875
And she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window	60.81165313720703
Help help for Master Broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people Help	278.18353271484375
Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching	127.27215576171875
Murder fire assassins Master Broussel is being killed Master Broussel is being strangled	22.170753479003906
It was Friquets voice and Dame Nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	20.969038009643555
Many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	151.5361785888672
They want to arrest Master Broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs	160.6976318359375
The crowd began to murmur and approached the house	93.08242797851562
The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	45.14963912963867
Do nt you see them cried Friquet do nt you see there they are	54.463768005371094
The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain	31.59955596923828
Ah devils coachman cried Friquet you re meddling too Wait	72.05526733398438
And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on	96.79788208007812
The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage	69.69111633300781
The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages	71.72391510009766
The cries which the police officer repeated twenty times In the kings name were powerless against this formidable multitudeseemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout In the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms illtreated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards	19.367624282836914
This gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger	31.31515121459961
He leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon	149.03225708007812
During ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last Comminges appeared pushing Broussel before him	54.418521881103516
Let us break the carriage cried the people	24.39250946044922
In the kings name cried Comminges	72.33258819580078
The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back	496.5257873535156
Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	71.16809844970703
At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	1356.5537109375
Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor	141.74856567382812
Very well sir said Comminges you shall hear of this anon	153.3168182373047
And you of me sir said Louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest	21.42593002319336
Friquet and Nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects	52.58024215698242
Down with the officer down with him was the cry	144.04141235351562
One step nearer said Comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoners breast one step nearer and I kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or dead	63.64451217651367
I will take him dead that s all	9.979666709899902
A terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	59.94189453125
Drive to the palace said Comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive	108.3741226196289
The man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd but on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd	63.41204833984375
Raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point	55.85185241699219
But this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude	171.846435546875
From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate	379.9588623046875
Voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed	47.55755615234375
Cries of Death death to the guards to the Seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it was	24.23542594909668
Raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell	100.62987518310547
The guards were unable to help any oneeach one was occupied with his selfpreservation	69.67254638671875
All was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to Raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall	41.97551727294922
Gods blood cried the officer have they killed him Woe to them if it be so	31.22007942199707
And he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the Seine	34.14278030395508
Monsieur dArtagnan murmured Raoul	152.20220947265625
Yes sdeath in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend	129.21527099609375
Come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught	251.43055725097656
Come sweep away all that for me Shoulder muskets Present arms Aim	102.97224426269531
At this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that DArtagnan could not repress a burst of Homeric laughter	232.03460693359375
Thank you DArtagnan said Comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your namethat I may mention it to the queen	53.30878829956055
Raoul was about to reply when DArtagnan bent down to his ear	57.20148468017578
Hold your tongue said he and let me answer	66.45820617675781
Do not lose time Comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed	57.80338668823242
Hold there s a carriage coming over yonder	16.531084060668945
Then bending again to Raoul he whispered Above all things do not divulge your name	87.8670425415039
That s right	54.299537658691406
I will go said Comminges and if they come back fire	107.56253814697266
Not at allnot at all replied DArtagnan let no one move	71.05640411376953
On the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly tomorrow	2.000459671020508
Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset	133.0196990966797
But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle	102.19439697265625
Start start said DArtagnan	343.7139892578125
There are ten men to accompany you	169.38609313964844
I will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment	352.4484558105469
Ten men for Monsieur de Comminges	37.473716735839844
As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and adjacent streets	164.98672485351562
A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	97.4198989868164
Forward cried DArtagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear	165.17974853515625
One man alone remained in his place gun in hand	51.035457611083984
Ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated Wait an instant	65.0735092163086
And he pointed his gun at DArtagnan who was riding toward him at full speed	80.29381561279297
DArtagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat	65.95492553710938
The horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall	38.21426010131836
DArtagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	144.40005493164062
Oh sir exclaimed Raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix spare him it is his son	96.19617462158203
DArtagnans arm dropped to his side	33.739601135253906
Ah you are his son he said that is a different thing	96.64554595947266
Sir I surrender said Louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer	67.97743225097656
Eh no do not surrender egad On the contrary be off and quickly	42.05539321899414
If I take you you will be hung	75.75779724121094
The young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud	29.385385513305664
Ifaith said DArtagnan to Raoul you were just in time to stay my hand	45.85165786743164
He was a dead man and on my honor if I had discovered that it was his son I should have regretted having killed him	19.941064834594727
Ah sir said Raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellows life to thank you on my own account	69.32325744628906
I too sir was almost dead when you arrived	56.514068603515625
Wait wait young man do not fatigue yourself with speaking	22.149438858032227
We can talk of it afterward	53.322959899902344
Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai Saint Michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	65.33007049560547
The musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom DArtagnan had given to Comminges appeared	80.02930450439453
Halloo cried DArtagnan has something fresh happened	57.02973937988281
Eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be doomed	56.95134353637695
They are bad managers said DArtagnan shrugging his shoulders	334.2710266113281
When a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong	130.00665283203125
The carriage in which a Broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men	127.35144805908203
What are your commands lieutenant	49.111114501953125
Take the detachment and conduct him to his place	156.6329345703125
But you will be left alone	53.49759292602539
So you suppose I have need of an escort Go	34.142879486083984
The musketeers set off and DArtagnan was left alone with Raoul	107.79642486572266
Now he said are you in pain	71.08378601074219
Yes my head is not only swimming but burning	99.32471466064453
What s the matter with this head said DArtagnan raising the battered hat	117.37811279296875
Ah ah a bruise	42.715309143066406
Yes I think I received a flowerpot upon my head	221.8019561767578
Brutes said DArtagnan	106.49642181396484
But were you not on horseback you have spurs	63.856605529785156
Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken away	133.9457244873047
Here it is I see	14.054364204406738
At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying Broussel Broussel	79.91768646240234
Halloo stop rascal cried DArtagnan	179.5991973876953
Bring hither that horse	132.42990112304688
Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	231.5266571044922
DArtagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it	92.01913452148438
Friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear	61.272762298583984
He saw DArtagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	33.86952209472656
Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward DArtagnan and I am truly pleased to meet you	222.1134490966797
DArtagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Calandre	79.54676818847656
Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer	40.3402214050293
Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Friquet	32.58113479614258
I was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongsan officer brave and handsome as a youthful Caesar then pretending to see Raoul for the first time	28.111480712890625
Ah but if I mistake not continued he here he is you wo nt forget the boy sir	48.65642166137695
Raoul put his hand in his pocket	16.799280166625977
What are you about asked DArtagnan	137.423583984375
To give ten francs to this honest fellow replied Raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	234.1021728515625
Ten kicks on his back said DArtagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your address	93.18754577636719
Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and disappeared	75.81684875488281
Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne	112.62271118164062
DArtagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	72.76696014404297
They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette	38.43843460083008
The handsome Madeleine announced to DArtagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit	154.18771362304688
DArtagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	43.53879165649414
Then bring some wine said DArtagnan	59.268218994140625
You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not	19.577823638916016
Well yes replied Raoul	86.3001937866211
It seems to me I did my duty	136.67637634277344
I defended the king	39.01042175292969
And who told you to defend the king	35.07890701293945
The Comte de la Fere himself	89.25942993164062
Yes the king but today you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same thing	31.143268585205078
But you yourself	166.36843872070312
Oh for me that is another matter	96.61416625976562
I obey my captains orders	39.4808349609375
As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no other	105.73927307128906
But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be furious	71.04735565185547
You think the count will be angry with me	57.194419860839844
Think it I m certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for us	280.00128173828125
However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe me	116.17630004882812
And moreover my dear child continued DArtagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian	289.9071960449219
I do not understand you sir said Raoul	21.742345809936523
DArtagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to Raoul	9.744902610778809
The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	865.6912841796875
Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to DArtagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me	42.87797164916992
He left four days ago said DArtagnan	189.8104705810547
But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death	20.376205444335938
Heheincur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long	3.224402904510498
I hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim	1399.8330078125
Oh no Monsieur dArtagnan said Raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you	59.47468566894531
Eh Egad love me too I will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a Frondist my young friend and a hearty Frondist too	63.936187744140625
But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse	77.8741455078125
I should say you could and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville and if the worthy Broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks	14.184961318969727
Well sir I will obey you although I do not understand you	187.20413208007812
It is unnecessary for you to understand	71.11314392089844
Hold continued DArtagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is Monsieur du Vallon who comes with his coat torn	90.11702728271484
Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many skins	86.41059875488281
Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizarde	56.26677322387695
A draught of wine DArtagnan	30.896947860717773
Oh Ill answer for you said the Gascon filling Porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion	159.55535888671875
Upon what asked Porthos	42.12334060668945
Look here resumed DArtagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comminges	47.82237243652344
The devil said Porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that	94.6518325805664
Do you hear interrupted DArtagnan become a Frondist my friend belong to the Fronde and remember that I fill the counts place in everything and he jingled his money	60.097816467285156
Will you come said he to Porthos	24.346458435058594
Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of wine	86.79691314697266
To present our respects to the cardinal	524.3819580078125
Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed DArtagnan	2055.144287109375
As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by DArtagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	123.88468933105469
Chapter XLV	61.3836555480957
The Beggar of St	183.16122436523438
DArtagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal he would give Comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he DArtagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	9.063285827636719
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely DArtagnan his captaincy Porthos his barony	454.40460205078125
DArtagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	82.26596069335938
But though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porthos	72.7515869140625
Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him	335.28277587890625
Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him	50.36785888671875
DArtagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head	151.8150634765625
Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle	50.99781036376953
DArtagnan and Porthos obeyed	56.23686218261719
The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the people	40.48670196533203
Broussel had been conducted out of Paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of Saint Germain while Blancmesnil who was arrested at the same time but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise was safe in the Castle of Vincennes	138.5732879638672
Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when DArtagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal	14.551624298095703
Ah madame said Comminges hastening to DArtagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector	85.1769027709961
Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river	69.721435546875
Speak DArtagnan speak	111.03956604003906
DArtagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him	85.40493774414062
Well sir at last said Anne of Austria you are silent after rendering such a service	47.334434509277344
Madame replied DArtagnan I have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majestys service and that I shall only be happy the day I lose it for you	69.36555480957031
I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem	55.55701446533203
Permit me madame said DArtagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Trville he has done wonders	170.2748565673828
His name asked the queen	91.79234313964844
In the regiment said DArtagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vallon	697.1126098632812
De Bracieux de Pierrefonds added Porthos	162.7616729736328
These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen graciously	38.16488265991211
Porthos bowed	32.453678131103516
At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage	71.68545532226562
Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde and Mazarin in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	115.43094635009766
The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day	202.55516052246094
Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	159.7946014404297
Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	480.3263244628906
He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received	419.5798034667969
The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him	69.81512451171875
His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule	40.23612976074219
He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	161.43185424804688
During the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers Anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	689.8072509765625
Immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	110.97959899902344
NogentBeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment	95.05714416503906
This caused a universal burst of laughter	74.7486572265625
The Count de Villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers	71.0184326171875
The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry IV	78.7278060913086
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry	224.85159301757812
During this storm Gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern	26.442712783813477
The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her	321.88006591796875
Yes madame replied the coadjutor I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom	214.76318359375
The queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	19.963865280151367
The coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	311.6853942871094
That glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized DArtagnan by the arm and said	33.84990692138672
If occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not	251.4691619873047
Yes my lord he replied	191.1570281982422
Then turning toward Porthos The devil said he this has a bad look	56.18599319458008
I dislike these quarrels among men of the church	44.89639663696289
Gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet	48.7327880859375
Oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court I will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another manner	98.18214416503906
But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal to increase the hilarity of the queen Mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls	63.732765197753906
On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was Louvieres	649.8631591796875
He hastened to his cabinet	104.97386169433594
Broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	120.23152160644531
The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend	126.87975311279297
The coadjutor went to him and held out his hand	117.25096130371094
The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	128.9763641357422
My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you	223.03732299804688
Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvieres	256.0662841796875
From the depth of my heart said Gondy	50.18653106689453
In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal	106.80149841308594
The coadjutor started	109.40174865722656
Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward manner	43.44450378417969
Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too grand	168.67649841308594
You are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth	89.7142562866211
As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvengeance	2.000459671020508
Give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and I will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements Paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from goodwill	43.815914154052734
It was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres	35.80607604980469
But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me	158.8556671142578
You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now	19.47045135498047
Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection	103.51964569091797
And how many hours of reflection do you ask	86.99302673339844
Twelve hours sir is it too long	152.19944763183594
It is now noon at midnight I will be at your house	28.969316482543945
If I should not be in wait for me	273.8838806152344
Good at midnight my lord	36.46669387817383
At midnight my dear Monsieur Louvieres	16.869884490966797
When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house	46.23933410644531
Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled there	86.57560729980469
Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie	134.3885040283203
The curates asked him what was to be done	127.2374496459961
Simply this said the coadjutor	307.42816162109375
You are the directors of all consciences	102.19277954101562
Well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work today this instant even and in three days I shall expect the result	55.33332443237305
For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest pleasure	121.80159759521484
Three curates remainedthose of St	53.86088180541992
Merri St	52.391422271728516
Sulpice and St	38.96152114868164
The others withdrew	72.4549331665039
You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gondy	225.40927124023438
We hope so answered the curates	142.30511474609375
Let us hear	114.24063110351562
Monsieur de St	16.36258316040039
Merri you begin	40.91288757324219
My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you	286.8543395996094
Who and what is this man	13.631650924682617
A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter	36.350929260253906
What is his name	113.42432403564453
He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared	52.311561584472656
And can you find him	574.6516723632812
I hope so	371.3236999511719
I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it too	131.67129516601562
Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me	143.6349639892578
We will be with you at six oclock my lord	64.97968292236328
Go my dear curate and may God assist you	103.93939208984375
And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of St	308.9871520996094
I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt	560.887939453125
Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Rochefort	27.86891746520996
I know him also but unfortunately he is not in Paris	143.45489501953125
My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cassette	44.046302795410156
And wherefore has he not been to see me	85.9206314086914
He was toldmy lord will pardon me	94.1868896484375
Certainly speak	64.43900299072266
That your lordship was about to treat with the court	80.9109115600586
Gondy bit his lips	91.0089340209961
They are mistaken bring him here at eight oclock sir and may Heaven bless you as I bless you	15.596094131469727
And now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us	65.59092712402344
Better my lord	51.96241760253906
Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you	77.65980529785156
I offer you a beggar my lord	64.66360473632812
Ah ah said Gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all France might hear it that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty	13.424660682678223
Exactly your man	103.51964569091797
Bravo and the man	35.430076599121094
A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of St	19.973054885864258
And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers	35.805057525634766
Are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything an association in which every one takes his share one that elects a leader	22.41478157043457
Yes I have heard it said replied the coadjutor	33.89250183105469
Well the man whom I offer you is a general syndic	31.10999298095703
And what do you know of him	90.11702728271484
Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse	667.3170776367188
What makes you think so	95.55239868164062
On the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass again	171.7664794921875
And his name	2022.092041015625
Maillard but I do not think it is his right one	56.244346618652344
And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post	19.7346248626709
Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true treasure	43.732242584228516
Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate	88.50794982910156
The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the St	53.97931671142578
Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling	123.62097930908203
The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing	106.64266967773438
On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church	72.69395446777344
Stop he said there he is at his post	682.9981079101562
Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand	58.703887939453125
Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gondy	18.734615325927734
No my lord these places are bought	51.13267135620117
I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his	193.21664428710938
The rascal is rich then	33.204185485839844
Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more	126.52474975585938
Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well invested	177.07254028320312
In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush	125.90436553955078
He was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes	134.77798461914062
His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance	302.28045654296875
He started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	180.2743682861328
The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	29.89303207397461
Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little	39.76614761352539
With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water	205.41802978515625
There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor	26.96646499633789
Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church	2854.567138671875
The mendicant shook his head	173.80230712890625
These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor	82.19279479980469
As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody	15.656564712524414
Explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor	6.745019912719727
I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it	4.824862957000732
My friend said Gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades	84.65400695800781
Yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end I wish to attainI mean the remission of my sins	45.101078033447266
The war will not only be approved of but directed by the church	35.80607604980469
As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him	69.13629150390625
Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for you	31.397085189819336
I know monsieur le cur said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to you	44.134517669677734
And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cur told me it was just now	93.2454605102539
I think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever I go they will follow me	69.64739990234375
And could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the Palais Royal by crying Down with Mazarin as fell those at Jericho	71.95057678222656
I think said the beggar I can undertake things more difficult and more important than that	43.123573303222656
Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades	57.159141540527344
I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them	76.9283218383789
Ifaith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le cur can answer for you	11.05151081085205
I answer for him said the curate	49.762081146240234
Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten oclock	64.02750396728516
It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of Paris	19.72119140625
Shall I give you a line for the vicar of St	305.96295166015625
Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate	83.85247802734375
Capital answered the mendicant	10.901535987854004
Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal	54.19511032104492
The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion	26.96646499633789
This evening sir he replied all will be ready	247.50369262695312
Chapter XLVI	290.94183349609375
The Tower of St	103.4879150390625
Jacques de la Boucherie	129.40171813964844
At a quarter to six oclock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace	63.734771728515625
At six oclock the curate of St	94.79827117919922
Merri was announced	38.463260650634766
The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man	27.975379943847656
The curate then entered followed by Planchet	139.10145568847656
Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to you	88.82838439941406
Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses	216.7061767578125
And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gondy	109.61087799072266
Most undoubtedly said Planchet	44.56247329711914
I am a Frondist from my heart	92.06446838378906
You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be hung	72.78760528564453
And on what account	174.53387451171875
I rescued from the hands of Mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five years	40.52499008178711
Will you name him	59.351844787597656
Oh you know him well my lordit is Count de Rochefort	47.4681396484375
Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair mentioned	71.97542572021484
You raised the whole district so they told me	45.33378601074219
Very nearly replied Planchet with a selfsatisfied air	186.7563018798828
And your business is	35.0738639831543
That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards	78.70757293701172
Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations	225.07847595214844
Why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots	34.23707962036133
Not badly answered ifaith said Gondy laughing but I have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations	184.27491760253906
Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur dArtagnan	84.7578125
The lieutenant of musketeers asked Gondy	9.224788665771484
Himself my lord	155.76402282714844
But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist	1258.831787109375
Phew whistled Planchet	22.01625633239746
What do you mean by that	36.48324966430664
Nothing my lord Monsieur dArtagnan belongs to the service Monsieur dArtagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs	28.31029510498047
You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you	226.9768524169922
You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city	12.550749778747559
Tis that exactly	51.96037673950195
How many men think you you could collect together tonight	1.679030418395996
Two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds	66.0195541381836
Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful army	2.000459671020508
Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort	2373.10498046875
I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the descent	43.448768615722656
By what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes	520.3500366210938
Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat	445.8056640625
Good Give the watchword	187.3884735107422
Do you want money	130.47293090820312
Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly	40.459381103515625
Gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	115.51337432861328
Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum tomorrow	212.005615234375
I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his arm	37.61227035522461
That is right I recommend the cardinal to your attention	66.42119598388672
Make your mind easy he is in good hands	384.17767333984375
Planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	85.41022491455078
Are you satisfied my lord he asked	43.77804183959961
Yes he appears to be a resolute fellow	29.453603744506836
Well he will do more than he has promised	26.049331665039062
He will do wonders then	23.726171493530273
The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs	128.72035217285156
Ten minutes later the curate of St	55.902320861816406
Sulpice was announced	118.04525756835938
As soon as the door of Gondys study was opened a man rushed in	88.19239807128906
It was the Count de Rochefort	141.08255004882812
Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his hand	191.0767364501953
You have made up your mind at last my lord said Rochefort	219.86160278320312
It has been made up a long time said Gondy	70.60187530517578
Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe you	84.62603759765625
Well we are going to give a ball to Mazarin	93.82608032226562
I hope so	14.711067199707031
And when will the dance begin	684.0071411132812
The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning	127.68307495117188
You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier dHumieres has promised me whenever I need them	62.57112503051758
Upon fifty soldiers	34.51401138305664
Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace them	98.26457977294922
Good my dear Rochefort but that is not all	47.42534637451172
What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort	40.10524368286133
He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to Paris	105.58163452148438
Write to him nows the time	224.9890899658203
You are sure of your enterprise	127.33802795410156
Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them	342.0091552734375
If he defers he will find the place of honor taken	60.638206481933594
Shall I send word to him as coming from you	94.01566314697266
Yes certainly	414.0438537597656
Shall I tell him that he can count on you	362.2931213378906
To the end	94.46967315673828
And you will leave the command to him	62.94794845581055
Of the war yes but in politics	22.588064193725586
You must know it is not his element	126.28178405761719
He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion	46.70630645751953
You care about it then so much	116.9682846069336
Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be red	109.74219512939453
One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort laughing	96.4302978515625
I answer for his consent	141.13038635253906
How soon can he be here	44.15568161010742
In five days	125.69831848144531
Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for it	55.22509002685547
Therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in readiness	486.2682189941406
For what	213.54147338867188
For everything	82.8097152709961
Is there any signal for the general rally	215.21435546875
A knot of straw in the hat	44.55832290649414
Very good	348.1543273925781
Adieu my lord	64.24491882324219
Adieu my dear Rochefort	142.4758758544922
Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of action	222.7608642578125
It was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of St	230.6368865966797
Jacques de la Boucherie	79.77288818359375
He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	173.46632385253906
Good said he our syndic is at his post	450.9830017089844
He knocked and the door was opened	48.09877395629883
The vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again	156.56736755371094
Although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked	176.65162658691406
Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed	224.15638732910156
He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock struck	73.68160247802734
Well said Gondy have you kept your word with me	84.68566131591797
Not exactly replied the mendicant	44.985511779785156
How is that	154.2183837890625
You asked me for five hundred men did you not Well I have ten thousand for you	217.36386108398438
You are not boasting	64.51811218261719
Do you wish for a proof	123.7696762084961
There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint Denis	63.836788177490234
The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	30.457412719726562
What are you doing asked the coadjutor	49.12260437011719
I have given the signal	299.9249267578125
For what	99.49052429199219
For the barricades	138.87188720703125
When you leave this you will behold my men at work	595.8206787109375
Only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole	60.30731964111328
Good there is your money the same sum as that you have received already	92.68885803222656
Now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink	25.421710968017578
For twenty years I have tasted nothing but water	121.46115112304688
The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces	61.6450080871582
Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow	61.77692413330078
The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag	79.0821533203125
Must I always be the same said he and shall I never succeed in overcoming the old leaven Oh misery oh vanity	526.906005859375
You take it however	321.3083801269531
Yes but I make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works	209.45513916015625
His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	95.62089538574219
Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door	64.25784301757812
His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	16.63739585876465
Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he cried	35.954463958740234
Your holiness said Gondy my friend you take me for some one else	60.72327423095703
No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first glance	162.87728881835938
Gondy smiled	71.93805694580078
And you want my blessing he said	63.65380096435547
Yes I have need of it	43.25642776489258
The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable	21.692420959472656
Now said Gondy there is a communion between us	40.55278778076172
I have blessed you and you are sacred to me	26.851633071899414
Come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which I can protect you	24.341943740844727
The beggar shook his head	36.485328674316406
The crime which I have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done	86.87359619140625
Come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now	92.5045166015625
No my lord	37.27973937988281
I have pursued it for six years only	409.0172424316406
And previously where were you	84.46715545654297
In the Bastile	49.42830276489258
And before you went to the Bastile	42.44087600708008
I will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession	54.853858947753906
Good At whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that I shall be ready to give you absolution	46.48910140991211
Thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice	58.96169662475586
But I am not yet ready to receive it	53.2181396484375
Very well	32.29116439819336
Adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate	52.440643310546875
Chapter XLVII	33.78457260131836
The Riot	215.42913818359375
It was about eleven oclock at night	69.83802795410156
Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of Paris	69.42694091796875
The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen	220.1657257080078
These active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the Court of Miraclesthe agents of the giver of holy water in the Square of Saint Eustache preparing barricades for the morrow	2.000459671020508
Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again	461.9471130371094
He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him	197.2593231201172
He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately	83.62523651123047
These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none	83.84259796142578
One individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could	388.5707702636719
By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planchet	166.94618225097656
The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie	36.90439987182617
They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	133.0001678466797
All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket	65.64656066894531
On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him	58.86500549316406
Who are you asked the man	323.05419921875
I do not know you for one of us	141.82177734375
Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat	101.15788269042969
Louvieres recognized him and bowed	45.2636604309082
Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle	1155.9178466796875
There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	52.4632568359375
They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks	83.79132843017578
When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet	310.0455322265625
Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one	178.01724243164062
The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gondy	47.8001594543457
He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat	95.13939666748047
Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms	121.338134765625
Rochefort recognized the voice	51.39604187011719
Ah it is you my lord said he	266.8170166015625
The very same	58.23591232299805
What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth	78.83057403564453
My fifty recruits from the Chevalier dHumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks	53.1619987487793
And where are you going	50.14765548706055
To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble	51.59921646118164
Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	318.9225769042969
It was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home	205.34652709960938
He opened a window and leaned out to listen	269.6929016113281
A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable caves	36.8414192199707
From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake	65.8328857421875
The work of revolt continued the whole night thus	69.18294525146484
The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance	135.35498046875
It was like a besieged town	267.5000915527344
Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step	34.29700469970703
Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten	38.458335876464844
They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting	99.15430450439453
The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais Royal	34.59670639038086
From the Rue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie from the Rue Saint ThomasduLouvre to the Pont Neuf from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte Saint Honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious	70.74031066894531
Among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words Behold the misery of the people Wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions	25.036706924438477
The astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	91.30695343017578
Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced	143.17298889160156
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	53.96468734741211
As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry	384.0274963378906
The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wo nt to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	51.62082290649414
He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men	138.87069702148438
The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay	76.87492370605469
But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois	114.82548522949219
This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows	138.91513061523438
He left there three men	45.9929084777832
He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly	96.79733276367188
He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle	72.73368835449219
The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache	70.49298858642578
They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	126.71602630615234
Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket	26.301298141479492
The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it	40.539554595947266
He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants	261.9886474609375
The twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagonwheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time Planchets halberdiers appeared at the corner of the Cemetery of the Innocents and Louvieress bourgeois at the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie	144.9504852294922
The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	83.19580078125
He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd	56.514068603515625
The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron	69.70637512207031
Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida	33.80944061279297
Fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain	41.557228088378906
In short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the Rue de lArbreSec the crowd opened crying Long live the coadjutor and Gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu	141.1876678466797
All fell to their knees	22.210494995117188
The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him	151.84315490722656
Get me out of this in Heavens name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men	51.349117279052734
A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	28.496492385864258
Gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	67.64283752441406
All were still	70.4499740600586
My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussels release	145.38327026367188
You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meilleraie	60.5780029296875
Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so easily	26.249622344970703
He gives you his word of honor said Gondy	99.4662857055664
The marshal raised his hand in token of assent	83.21952819824219
Long live the coadjutor cried the crowd	133.38185119628906
Some voices even added Long live the marshal But all took up the cry in chorus Down with Mazarin	82.79988098144531
The crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by Friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet	33.31655502319336
It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again	112.44193267822266
The marshal bit his fingers	26.902210235595703
In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order	118.43592834472656
He called for DArtagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him DArtagnan not being on service	37.72432327270508
In about ten minutes DArtagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porthos	135.73475646972656
Ah come in come in Monsieur dArtagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too	67.98385620117188
But what is going on in this accursed Paris	82.25791931152344
What is going on my lord nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking his head	51.27838134765625
The town is in open revolt and just now as I was crossing the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry Long live Broussel and must I tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well	104.06977081298828
Speak speak	105.20130157470703
Down with Mazarin Ifaith the treasonable word is out	80.8720703125
Mazarin smiled but became very pale	86.3451919555664
And you did cry he asked	78.03643798828125
Ifaith no said DArtagnan I was not in voice Monsieur du Vallon has a cold and did not cry either	1262.3848876953125
Then my lord	65.71878051757812
Then what asked Mazarin	62.72745132446289
Look at my hat and cloak	137.76541137695312
And DArtagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver	448.43487548828125
As for Porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two	80.93708038330078
Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I should	129.55873107910156
At this moment the tumult was heard nearer	175.78529357910156
Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	133.9325714111328
He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	36.508689880371094
See what is going on Monsieur DArtagnan said he	28.174068450927734
DArtagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	212.52554321289062
Oho said he what is this Marechal de la Meilleraie returning without a hatFontrailles with his arm in a slingwounded guardshorses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about They are aimingthey are going to fire	43.64411544799805
They have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the Palais Royal exclaimed Mazarin	1269.5474853515625
But if they fire all is lost cried DArtagnan	78.56808471679688
We have the gates	80.16879272460938
The gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder Gods death do nt fire screamed DArtagnan throwing open the window	65.38790893554688
In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge	31.56788444519043
The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under DArtagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring himself	29.289419174194336
Alack alack cried the cardinal a Venetian glass	82.70719909667969
Oh my lord said DArtagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal whether they be Venetian or Parisian	48.36219024658203
But what do you advise then asked Mazarin trembling	41.63717269897461
Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to anybody	230.5679473876953
And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do	76.52613067626953
I should give up Broussel said Porthos	142.36585998535156
Come come with me gentlemen exclaimed Mazarin	14.489492416381836
I will go and discuss the matter with the queen	73.95073699951172
He stopped at the end of the corridor and said	15.328939437866211
I can count upon you gentlemen can I not	22.611940383911133
We do not give ourselves twice over said DArtagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey	47.83340072631836
Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come back	91.31086730957031
And turning off he entered the drawingroom by another door	105.08940124511719
Chapter XLVIII	46.255733489990234
The Riot becomes a Revolution	91.5395278930664
The closet into which DArtagnan and Porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	57.556236267089844
The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm	9.448399543762207
Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men	40.7591552734375
The Chancellor Sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel dO that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the Bishop of Meaux	262.234130859375
Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	4.351946830749512
Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	42.82707977294922
Then disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dO he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door	13.436395645141602
During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	62.28745651245117
Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all	42.59178161621094
I think that matters look very gloomy madame	62.60093688964844
But what step would you propose to me	21.264245986938477
I could propose one to your majesty but I dare not	107.44530487060547
You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once	174.38714599609375
The chancellor reddened and stammered some words	158.28314208984375
It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advicewhat is it	165.23709106445312
Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Broussel	109.69213104248047
The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted	82.92782592773438
Release Broussel she cried never	211.62937927246094
At this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door	159.55604553222656
Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joyfully	111.17991638183594
I trust you have brought this rabble to reason	38.037750244140625
Madame replied the marechal I have left three men on the Pont Neuf four at the Halle six at the corner of the Rue de lArbreSec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	40.16217803955078
I have brought away ten or twelve wounded	133.41920471191406
I know not where I have left my hat and in all probability I should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me	72.79100799560547
Ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this	64.38040161132812
Madame said La Meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh	27.357833862304688
Very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all I wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back	69.18486022949219
Yes madame but I only came back on one conditionthat I would transmit to your majesty the will of the people	12.946242332458496
The will exclaimed the queen frowning	155.35243225097656
Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission	143.30783081054688
The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal	98.91252899169922
Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people	139.3778533935547
As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid	98.9542236328125
The queen smiled	376.8887939453125
Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I can not count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was afraid	76.63571166992188
Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest hell	100.31100463867188
Bravo said DArtagnan in a whisper to Porthos well answered	111.61852264404297
Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people	109.75900268554688
That Broussel shall be given up to them madame	52.893592834472656
Never said the queen never	141.04385375976562
Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few steps	232.74424743652344
Where are you going marechal asked the queen	107.81009674072266
To give your majestys reply to those who await it	24.643104553222656
Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with rebels	102.01776123046875
Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to return	157.90869140625
Anne of Austrias eyes shot glances of fire	174.24600219726562
Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrestedGuitant	66.55985260009766
Mazarin sprang forward	24.305036544799805
Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise	221.59603881835938
Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the trouble	46.17801284790039
No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other	14.21182632446289
Then what may it be	128.216064453125
To call for monsieur le coadjuteur	9.10329532623291
The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this revolt	51.276885986328125
The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down	44.515377044677734
And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais Royal	262.51800537109375
The queen sprang to the window	40.12702941894531
It is true she said the arch hypocritesee	25.104162216186523
I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to pieces	178.75677490234375
I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor	27.021137237548828
And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	10.137930870056152
Mazarin bowed	119.44140625
Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me	26.39026641845703
And what shall I say to the people	50.48246765136719
That they must have patience said Anne as I have	93.98938751220703
The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	108.03132629394531
DArtagnan turned to Porthos	43.32805252075195
How will this end he said	213.60755920410156
We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil way	367.5449523925781
In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by DArtagnan and Porthos	45.69923400878906
Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor	18.953380584716797
There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majestys summons	42.69660186767578
The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded	170.841064453125
Gondy bowed respectfully	12.419681549072266
Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot	158.74465942382812
That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt	36.70277786254883
The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult	69.84172058105469
Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to rights	144.6876678466797
Was it to tell me that madame coldly replied Gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence	299.0311279296875
No my dear coadjutor said Mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves	30.702133178710938
Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion	76.0489730834961
Yes said the queen it is requested	152.964111328125
The coadjutor bowed	63.44798278808594
Your majesty wishes then	80.99274444580078
You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to reply	87.89080047607422
The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative	219.47036743164062
Were I in her majestys place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Broussel	29.36625862121582
And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen	41.45356369018555
I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the marechal	40.843318939208984
It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning around	127.649658203125
If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every respect	166.28619384765625
The color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger	79.09799194335938
Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed	46.18185806274414
Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	42.43495559692383
Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest	58.32859802246094
Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop	30.286455154418945
He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his turn	40.52970504760742
Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little	60.527099609375
Ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend	38.9608039855957
I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end	141.04904174804688
If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean	105.400146484375
Did I say dead or alive replied Mazarin	2.000459671020508
It was only a way of speaking	99.7220230102539
You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well	170.0421600341797
This is a council of state DArtagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aramis	211.74757385253906
At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porthos	423.8945617675781
There and elsewhere	557.1170654296875
The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity	53.72963333129883
Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	72.6729507446289
I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution	70.85999298095703
Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution	156.8489227294922
Yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	169.05776977539062
But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint	63.09679412841797
It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England madame	118.97586822509766
Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the queen	504.9595031738281
Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have struck	187.94293212890625
Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart	135.05609130859375
Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well at that priest	244.43585205078125
Yes said Porthos I see him	217.03514099121094
What then	41.038002014160156
Well he is a man	86.27510070800781
Porthos looked at DArtagnan in astonishment	138.96859741210938
Evidently he did not understand his meaning	42.90434646606445
Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters	64.56485748291016
In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them	108.03343200683594
Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt	166.3272705078125
Have I not then that right cried the queen	153.0512237548828
If you have it use it replied Gondy	129.28497314453125
Peste said DArtagnan to Porthos	41.70509338378906
There is a man after my own heart	53.168235778808594
Oh if he were minister and I were his DArtagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together	163.72325134277344
Yes said Porthos	75.61837768554688
The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	84.78606414794922
Stay sir said Anne to him	157.1490478515625
Good thought Gondy she is going to yield	432.3664245605469
She is going to have him killed said DArtagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by me	193.2923126220703
I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon them	90.11702728271484
And I too said Porthos	20.00587272644043
Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling	70.93561553955078
The queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	18.630964279174805
It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down	87.41212463378906
Gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good Spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach	44.021121978759766
And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur	101.29501342773438
It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the people	48.30359649658203
Oh cried Anne to humble myself thus Am I or am I not the queen This screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects Have I friends Have I guards Ah by Notre Dame as Queen Catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous Broussel to them I will strangle him with my own hands	83.57345581054688
And she sprang toward Gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than Broussel with outstretched arms	134.35755920410156
The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen	51.63950729370117
He were a dead man said the Gascon if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me	131.1380157470703
Hush said Porthos listen	53.76652908325195
Madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back Madame what are you about	29.12717628479004
Then he added in Spanish Anne are you mad You a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman And do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown Come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but today is not the proper time today flatter and caress or you are only a common woman	112.41561126708984
At the first words of this address DArtagnan had seized Porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	68.72640991210938
When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone	103.68647766113281
Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are also	127.01177215576172
All right said Porthos	149.04583740234375
This rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French was uttered with such impenetrable expression that Gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued	20.123409271240234
The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said	672.6536254882812
Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I suffer	80.3764877319336
A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first opposition	36.806644439697266
Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition	83.37554931640625
Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	33.35118103027344
It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government	225.05088806152344
Mazarin who at the words It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries Down with Mazarin and pleased with Gondys suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression	106.531005859375
Madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinals hat seems to belong already to his noble brow	519.4291381835938
Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gondy	116.96723175048828
And what will he promise us said DArtagnan	181.8712615966797
Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment tomorrow	160.65274047851562
Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constables sword gilt for me	25.12196159362793
And for me put in Porthos	50.69956588745117
For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now	200.12164306640625
And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult	10.416332244873047
Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction	46.62841033935547
And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it	233.60093688964844
Go I will reflect	143.00445556640625
Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais Royal	24.115697860717773
Gondy smiled the queens color rose and Mazarin grew even paler	279.1871337890625
What is that again he asked	131.46803283691406
At this moment Comminges rushed into the room	4.629002094268799
Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands	1107.4888916015625
Listen madame said Gondy	69.62979888916016
The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment	9387.513671875
What are my commands said the queen	3267.746826171875
Yes for time presses	91.49331665039062
How many men have you about the Palais Royal	154.28958129882812
Six hundred	26.98664093017578
Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me	93.95856475830078
Madame cried Mazarin what are you about	161.85377502441406
Go said the queen	58.826480865478516
Comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	52.3245735168457
At this moment a monstrous battering was heard	66.01551818847656
One of the gates began to yield	231.66934204101562
Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me	42.03173065185547
At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges	410.205322265625
It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late	121.29387664794922
The gale had given way	214.85987854003906
Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	162.40367126464844
DArtagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his example	248.8029327392578
Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadjutor	20.45990753173828
Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men	98.30432891845703
Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing	1117.734619140625
What are you saying asked the queen	66.94412994384766
The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore youI command you	69.84684753417969
The queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed	280.0819396972656
The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued	29.9034481048584
The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed it	64.15200805664062
The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand	466.9637756347656
This is the order he said	147.8461151123047
All Paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of Long live Broussel Long live the coadjutor	181.896240234375
Long live the queen cried De Gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make Anne of Austria sensible of her weakness	131.1295623779297
And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gondy	147.60203552246094
Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her command	28.821624755859375
Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me today	84.49459075927734
Mazarin wished to approach her	161.01541137695312
Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	32.86698913574219
It is you who are not a woman muttered Mazarin	520.9275512695312
Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left DArtagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything	64.16788482666016
He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside	42.3004264831543
The closet was empty	364.5195007324219
At the queens last word DArtagnan had dragged Porthos into the gallery	5.576025485992432
Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	239.57215881347656
Why did you leave the closet Monsieur dArtagnan asked the cardinal	873.122314453125
Because replied DArtagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest	43.39106750488281
And you have been here since	41.52634048461914
About a quarter of an hour said DArtagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict him	47.11944580078125
Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that DArtagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood	73.70356750488281
Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are the man I have been seeking	95.86972045898438
You may reckon upon me and so may your friend	118.54248809814453
Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	256.9876403808594
Chapter XLIX	27.473508834838867
Misfortune refreshes the Memory	63.9041862487793
Anne of Austria returned to her oratory furious	33.56144332885742
What she cried wringing her beautiful hands What the people have seen Monsieur de Cond a prince of the blood royal arrested by my motherinlaw Maria de Medicis they saw my motherinlaw their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw Monsieur de Vendome that is to say the son of Henry IV	68.16937255859375
a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Brousselgood God what then is to become of royalty	113.4051284790039
The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question	122.69200134277344
The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves	107.1791763305664
During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every direction	86.0876235961914
Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge	99.57366943359375
What matters it about Brousselit is a name not a thing	175.6973114013672
Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a name	139.42510986328125
The next morning therefore when Broussel made his entrance into Paris in a large carriage having his son Louvieres at his side and Friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of Long live Broussel Long live our father resounded from all parts and was death to Mazarins ears and the cardinals spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen	2.000459671020508
The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of Austria	2881.22265625
The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together	84.12116241455078
By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades	48.173797607421875
They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades	62.01451110839844
Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier dHumieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call	34.28487014770508
But the chevalier was himself at heart a Frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation	38.406227111816406
The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other	74.78401947021484
No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty	63.564083099365234
Louvieres was proud and satisfied he had taken revenge on Mazarin and had aided in his fathers deliverance from prison	40.910099029541016
His name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal	199.67916870117188
Laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family	84.50788116455078
Do you think father that if now I should ask for a company the queen would give it to me	61.345298767089844
DArtagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other	47.5230712890625
Raoul had offered some opposition at first but DArtagnan made use of the Comte de la Feres name and after paying a visit to Madame de Chevreuse Raoul started to rejoin the army	41.56330490112305
Rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	277.2236633300781
He had written to the Duc de Beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find Paris tranquil	299.7873840332031
He went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but Gondy reflected for a moment and then said	4.409127712249756
Let him continue his journey	218.56533813476562
All is not then over asked Rochefort	67.74658966064453
My dear count we have only just begun	45.60159683227539
What induces you to think so	39.393550872802734
The knowledge that I have of the queens heart she will not rest contented beaten	79.27493286132812
Is she then preparing for a stroke	78.5811538696289
I hope so	234.9805450439453
Come let us see what you know	258.0776062011719
I know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army	9.678057670593262
Ah ha said Rochefort you are right	218.46539306640625
We must let Monsieur de Beaufort come	150.94606018066406
In fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the Prince de Cond had arrived	66.92265319824219
It was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation	62.89865493774414
It was said that Madame de Longueville for whom the prince had more than a brothers affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet	48.985111236572266
His confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	19.564477920532227
Even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying	11.641219139099121
Why do we not take the king and place him in the Hotel de Ville It is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people	54.87845230102539
That night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shoppeople and the bands of mendicants reappeared	55.34989547729492
The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five oclock in the morning	69.06290435791016
At five oclock Anne went to the cardinals room	260.00079345703125
If she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	59.26832962036133
Six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queens apartments	85.45528411865234
Anne of Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	130.98052978515625
The cardinal therefore rose to open it	174.51724243164062
The queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like Diana of Poictiers and Ninon Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression	49.50505828857422
What is the matter madame said Mazarin uneasily	82.73030853271484
You seem secretly elated	5.951686382293701
Yes Giulio she said proud and happy for I have found the means of strangling this hydra	138.6144561767578
You are a great politician my queen said Mazarin let us hear the means	52.00746154785156
And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper	20.283037185668945
You know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me	140.7360382080078
Alas yes and to hang me	213.9740447998047
They shall not have the king	173.32012939453125
Nor hang me	103.66873168945312
I want to carry off my son from them with yourself	38.404964447021484
I wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person	89.73641967773438
And who is this third person	48.65142059326172
Monsieur le Prince	54.44822692871094
He has come then as they told me	285.2965393066406
Last evening	43.297813415527344
And you have seen him	40.467323303222656
He has just left me	111.11090850830078
And will he aid this project	49.601036071777344
The plan is his own	55.777122497558594
And Paris	84.60553741455078
He will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion	61.67496871948242
The plan is not wanting in grandeur I see but one impediment	26.211009979248047
What is it	199.0817413330078
A senseless word	121.1381607055664
Nothing is impossible	95.36354064941406
On paper	71.17132568359375
In execution	32.306373596191406
We have money	27.774673461914062
A little said Mazarin trembling lest Anne should ask to draw upon his purse	107.2417984008789
Five or six thousand men	1015.2078857421875
Then the thing is easy	58.001155853271484
Oh do think of it Giulio Paris this odious Paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famishedhaving for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs	29.77762794494629
Charming charming said Mazarin	46.59756088256836
I can imagine the effect I do not see the means	46.339874267578125
I will find the means myself	21.021167755126953
You are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable	39.25868606567383
Oh yes yes war said Anne of Austria	222.7148895263672
Yes I will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	20.568382263183594
I will extinguish the fire with blood I will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example	40.116634368896484
Paris II detest I loathe it	41.138031005859375
Very fine Anne	32.133724212646484
You are now sanguinary but take care	90.65974426269531
We are not in the time of Malatesta and Castruccio Castracani	37.22227096557617
You will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity	344.5078430175781
You laugh	189.7987060546875
It is dangerous to go to war with a nation	82.12345123291016
Look at your brother monarch Charles I	158.47117614746094
He is badly off very badly	83.61235809326172
We are in France and I am Spanish	58.656150817871094
So much the worse I had much rather you were French and myself also they would hate us both less	45.56976318359375
Nevertheless you consent	158.1514129638672
Yes if the thing be possible	68.65150451660156
It is it is I who tell you so make preparations for departure	35.09291076660156
I I am always prepared to go only as you know I never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before	148.51502990722656
In short if I go will you go too	18.700517654418945
I will try	24.805757522583008
You torment me Giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then	93.32642364501953
Of many things	68.1807861328125
What are they	47.98284912109375
Mazarins face smiling as it was became clouded	1389.9027099609375
Anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity	33.72472381591797
You accuse me of fear I have not so much as you have since I do not fly as you do	18.068603515625
Against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself Whom would they hang yourself or me Well I can weather the stormI whom notwithstanding you tax with fearnot with bravado that is not my way but I am firm	36.60411834716797
Imitate me	13.564754486083984
Make less hubbub and think more deeply	45.596290588378906
You cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying	13.787700653076172
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queens hand led her to the window	117.94139862060547
Look he said	75.5941162109375
Well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	47.29313659667969
Well what do you see from this window If I am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the League and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other sidewhat do you see Creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors	33.57888412475586
You will see the same at every opening from this palace to which I should lead you	422.2552490234375
Your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and I could say to you as that good La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out	58.761775970458984
He did get out nevertheless	174.54721069335938
Do you think of escaping in the same way	47.240543365478516
I am a prisoner then	77.60165405273438
Parbleu said Mazarin I have been proving it to you this last hour	103.20219421386719
And he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted	99.72334289550781
Anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her	57.99070358276367
Mazarin did not even turn around	145.16172790527344
When once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea	37.76139831542969
I am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes I know a man who will find the means of taking me from Paris a man I have too long forgotten	88.51055908203125
Then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy Ungrateful woman that I am for twenty years I have forgotten this man whom I ought to have made a marechal of France	54.30766677856445
My motherinlaw expended gold caresses dignities on Concini who ruined her the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination while I have left in obscurity in poverty the noble DArtagnan who saved me	151.4109344482422
And running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write	24.75321388244629
Chapter L	14.33010196685791
The Interview	29.779521942138672
It had been DArtagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as Porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	90.42635345458984
As for Porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them	51.16203689575195
They were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for DArtagnan	186.66761779785156
From whom asked the Gascon	31.780738830566406
From the queen replied the servant	95.52738189697266
Ho said Porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say	228.7159423828125
DArtagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst Porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	144.30638122558594
Friend Porthos said DArtagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and I of my captaincy	14.464652061462402
Read for yourself and judge	158.47268676757812
Porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words	2.000459671020508
The queen wishes to speak to Monsieur dArtagnan who must follow the bearer	2055.293212890625
Well exclaimed Porthos I see nothing in that very extraordinary	39.43779373168945
But I see much that is very extraordinary in it replied DArtagnan	271.8135681152344
It is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	54.61288833618164
Just reflect a little what an agitation the queens mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years	95.57882690429688
It is true said Porthos	199.2554473876953
Sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for I will answer for it something lightninglike will happen ere tomorrow	101.95088958740234
But stop do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us suggested Porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people	196.45458984375
If it is a snare replied DArtagnan I shall scent it out be assured	123.02680969238281
If Mazarin is an Italian I am a Gascon	49.139835357666016
And DArtagnan dressed himself in an instant	9.41748046875
Whilst Porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	42.73001480102539
Come in exclaimed DArtagnan and another servant entered	82.71520233154297
From His Eminence Cardinal Mazarin presenting a letter	95.1968002319336
DArtagnan looked at Porthos	42.233726501464844
A complicated affair said Porthos where will you begin	9.41748046875
It is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour	84.31556701660156
My friend said DArtagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour I shall be at his command	22.568525314331055
It is very fortunate resumed the Gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one	49.97306823730469
Do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing	25.004478454589844
I do not think it I am certain of it	109.68339538574219
Quick quick DArtagnan	29.356393814086914
Remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself	88.44200897216797
DArtagnan summoned Anne of Austrias servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queens presence	77.32111358642578
The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu then they gained the private staircase and DArtagnan was ushered into the oratory	534.427001953125
A certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	33.95103454589844
Formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general	110.75765991210938
The silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and DArtagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	23.15489959716797
The queen entered	291.8975830078125
It is you Monsieur dArtagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and I know you well	56.33531188964844
Look at me well in your turn	249.1145477294922
I am the queen do you recognize me	84.6868667602539
No madame replied DArtagnan	85.87316131591797
But are you no longer aware continued Anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalierthat she found this cavalierand that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart	157.95591735839844
No madame I was ignorant of that said the musketeer	56.43083190917969
So much the worse sir said Anne of Austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same devotion	649.5025634765625
What exclaimed DArtagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or positiondoes she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier	1253.0311279296875
Anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	36.01680374145508
She had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman	47.36766052246094
She had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity	48.469913482666016
All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded Monsieur dArtagnan is doubtless true said the queen but I have confidence in you alone	35.857032775878906
I know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune	169.6885986328125
Come will you do today what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen	86.16331481933594
I will do everything your majesty commands replied DArtagnan	35.041343688964844
The queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer	151.9519500732422
Perhaps you like repose she said	175.0087432861328
I do not know for I have never had it madame	69.95774841308594
Have you any friends	54.72706985473633
I had three two of whom have left Paris to go I know not where	47.4681396484375
One alone is left to me but he is one of those known I believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak	58.073219299316406
Very good said the queen you and your friend are worth an army	58.77693557739258
What am I to do madame	23.187091827392578
Return at five oclock and I will tell you but do not breathe to a living soul sir the rendezvous which I give you	35.99964141845703
No madame	31.96672248840332
Swear it upon the cross	94.0327377319336
Madame I have never been false to my word when I say I will not do a thing I mean it	164.5838623046875
The queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which DArtagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project	61.68561553955078
It was one of the Gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty	35.992156982421875
Has the queen any further commands for me now asked DArtagnan	43.99513244628906
No sir replied Anne of Austria and you may retire until the time that I mentioned to you	107.32682037353516
DArtagnan bowed and went out	166.60240173339844
Diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now	37.937782287597656
Then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals door	28.791645050048828
Bernouin introduced him	160.13609313964844
I come for your commands my lord he said	54.31053924560547
And according to his custom DArtagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him	1523.6871337890625
But it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	135.39552307128906
You come from the queen said Mazarin looking fixedly at DArtagnan	82.21772003173828
I my lordwho told you that	112.4928207397461
Nobody but I know it	23.886886596679688
I regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the Gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to Anne of Austria	6.724014759063721
I opened the door of the anteroom myself and I saw you enter at the end of the corridor	76.12295532226562
Because I was shown up the private stairs	39.180206298828125
How so	48.2520751953125
I know not it must have been a mistake	33.44984817504883
Mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make DArtagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing	64.59156036376953
Let us speak of my affairs said Mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours	402.3327941894531
Are you fond of traveling	932.1483764648438
My life has been passed on the high road	30.439342498779297
Would anything retain you particularly in Paris	42.318084716796875
Nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris	138.6322479248047
Very well	113.27310180664062
Here is a letter which must be taken to its address	43.2643928527832
To its address my lord But it has none	175.08970642089844
In fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank	88.48896026611328
I must tell you resumed Mazarin that it is in a double envelope	116.53605651855469
I understand and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a certain place	166.66770935058594
Just so take it and go	55.20494842529297
You have a friend Monsieur du Vallon whom I like much let him accompany you	97.72669982910156
The devil said DArtagnan to himself	86.27810668945312
He knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from Paris	27.329635620117188
Do you hesitate asked Mazarin	47.4681396484375
No my lord and I will set out at once	154.94906616210938
There is one thing only which I must request	87.05606079101562
What is it Speak	57.72224044799805
That your eminence will go at once to the queen	52.217918395996094
What for	204.86886596679688
Merely to say these words I am going to send Monsieur dArtagnan away and I wish him to set out directly	82.7335433959961
I told you said Mazarin that you had seen the queen	49.62302780151367
I had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake	57.72114562988281
What is the meaning of that	173.30616760253906
May I venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence	15.48812198638916
Very well I will go	131.0398712158203
Wait here for me	293.6600036621094
And looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets Mazarin went out	22.77993392944336
Ten minutes elapsed during which DArtagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second	92.86395263671875
But he did not succeed	68.50337219238281
Mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	46.00939178466797
He seated himself at his desk and DArtagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter	271.45361328125
Ah thought the Gascon he looks displeased	9.631996154785156
Can it be with me He meditates	41.50668716430664
Is it about sending me to the Bastile All very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will strangle you and become Frondist	37.95365905761719
I should be carried home in triumph like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus	187.25555419921875
It would be exceedingly droll	62.928504943847656
The Gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	31.42388153076172
Mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating	159.4131622314453
You were right he said my dear Monsieur dArtagnan and you can not set out yet	51.37855529785156
I beg you to return me that dispatch	28.791645050048828
DArtagnan obeyed and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	54.320045471191406
I shall want you this evening he said Return in two hours	20.368322372436523
My lord said DArtagnan I have an appointment in two hours which I can not miss	126.27105712890625
Do not be uneasy said Mazarin it is the same	66.14852905273438
Good thought DArtagnan I fancied it was so	1559.8076171875
Return then at five oclock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you	42.666053771972656
Only leave him in the anteroom as I wish to speak to you alone	88.40603637695312
DArtagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais Royal	91.54904174804688
Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret	46.17213439941406
You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneasily	473.0184326171875
Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not	60.071800231933594
Armed to the teeth replied Mazarin	41.08218002319336
Very well my lord it shall be so	74.05867767333984
DArtagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarins flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable happiness	66.11437225341797
Chapter LI	169.00119018554688
The Flight	134.36370849609375
When DArtagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	112.9933853149414
Nor was that surprising	42.24582290649414
The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for	25.055561065673828
The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet	139.101318359375
The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	71.31848907470703
Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and wit	392.57208251953125
Mazarin disappeared as they rose from table	254.08436584472656
He found DArtagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anteroom	108.75382995605469
The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study	39.82496643066406
My dear M	45.989341735839844
dArtagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer	3513.653076171875
I hope said DArtagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of it	133.04368591308594
More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to you	47.08518981933594
We are about to leave this evening continued Mazarin	51.38703536987305
My dear M	94.53275299072266
dArtagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands	46.32538604736328
He paused	56.6590461730957
Explain yourself my lord I am listening	161.57554626464844
The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germain	63.77316665649414
Aha said DArtagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave Paris	116.86007690429688
A womans capriceyou understand	84.6554946899414
Yes I understand perfectly said DArtagnan	126.28015899658203
It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock	6.245054244995117
Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered DArtagnan	102.98751831054688
Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the same	23.077417373657227
Do you disapprove of this journey my dear M	92.55238342285156
dArtagnan asked Mazarin anxiously	6.245054244995117
I my lord said DArtagnan why should I	215.19053649902344
Because you shrug your shoulders	71.24993896484375
It is a way I have of speaking to myself	27.299179077148438
I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your commands	44.577789306640625
Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain	86.13312530517578
Liar thought DArtagnan	117.83869171142578
You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving DArtagnans composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands	38.60295486450195
Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a charge	47.264381408691406
You accept however	29.09451675415039
I always accept	61.12181091308594
Do you think the thing possible	111.94755554199219
Everything is possible	50.71845245361328
Shall you be attacked on the road	78.0909652709961
And what will you do in that case	25.391271591186523
I shall pass through those who attack me	24.082561492919922
And suppose you can not pass through them	89.10956573486328
So much the worse for them I shall pass over them	179.09779357910156
And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain	24.929222106933594
On your life	38.516441345214844
On my life	150.3158416748047
You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration	79.94197082519531
DArtagnan smiled	45.6151008605957
And I asked Mazarin after a moments silence	33.834171295166016
How and you my lord	101.1230697631836
If I wish to leave	254.1461639404297
That would be much more difficult	117.03925323486328
Why so	288.0196533203125
Your eminence might be recognized	83.01043701171875
Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	58.32186508178711
If your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy	32.302284240722656
Ah said Mazarin breathing more freely	19.152318954467773
But it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our placecry Down with Mazarin	97.47440338134766
I will Down with Mazarin	16.653018951416016
In French in good French my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian badly	65.23139190673828
Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vespers	95.35967254638672
I will do my best	40.07331848144531
The streets are full of armed men continued DArtagnan	16.013879776000977
Are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project	52.399940490722656
Mazarin reflected	42.766849517822266
This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything	53.1503791809082
Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first	18.984079360961914
And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort me	50.314327239990234
Shall you not go with the queen	51.48625946044922
No replied Mazarin	74.33513641357422
Then you will start after the queen	17.962400436401367
No said Mazarin again	34.04279708862305
Ah said DArtagnan who began to understand	41.63684844970703
Yes continued the cardinal	46.97334289550781
I have my plan	39.909950256347656
With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be forgotten	204.8302764892578
The great are often ungrateful	204.15493774414062
Very true said DArtagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which Mazarin wore on his finger	142.4175262451172
Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside	74.7509765625
I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me	7.124205112457275
It is but Christian charity replied DArtagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation	28.16614532470703
It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before them	6.382944107055664
DArtagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute Italian	70.29594421386719
Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	42.60438537597656
You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear M	23.585304260253906
A difficult commission my lord replied DArtagnan resuming his serious manner	223.59690856933594
But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen	98.54579162597656
The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for them	12.379899978637695
If they ask it what have I to say	334.9941711425781
That is true murmured Mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine I suppose I must buy it must I not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	35.975120544433594
DArtagnan smiled	2592.790283203125
These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other	68.25830078125
But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful	46.54343032836914
Is it still only an intention your eminence asked DArtagnan	99.48127746582031
Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear DArtagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I pray	37.01279830932617
DArtagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure	153.91409301757812
I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great pleasure	110.71794891357422
And I my lord said DArtagnan accept it as it is given	95.07259368896484
Come let us speak of your little affairs	42.24471664428711
You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour	54.084747314453125
At ten oclock	77.75789642333984
And the queen at what time is it her wish to start	252.00416564941406
At midnight	65.93743896484375
Then it is possible	111.4948959350586
I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her	107.14166259765625
Capital but how will you get me out of Paris	88.75323486328125
Oh as to that you must leave it to me	51.18916320800781
I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like	271.39251708984375
DArtagnan shook his head	199.73593139648438
It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest method	37.26647186279297
Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking	26.971452713012695
Or find some one else continued DArtagnan turning his back	79.31489562988281
Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond M	41.602630615234375
dArtagnan my dear M	73.91526794433594
dArtagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything	44.45636749267578
I will answer for nothing	56.58846664428711
I will do my best	60.60195541381836
Well then let us goI must trust to you	74.92761993408203
It is very fortunate said DArtagnan to himself	40.00150680541992
You will be here at halfpast nine	56.33635711669922
And I shall find your eminence ready	11.311244010925293
Certainly quite ready	74.4137191772461
Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen	174.77908325195312
For what purpose	149.33201599121094
I wish to receive her majestys commands from her own lips	41.99228286743164
She desired me to give them to you	24.71149253845215
She may have forgotten something	48.49385452270508
You really wish to see her	771.623046875
It is indispensable my lord	123.1588134765625
Mazarin hesitated for one instant but DArtagnan was firm	2.000459671020508
Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation	62.151485443115234
What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied DArtagnan	117.54967498779297
Swear to be mute	70.60379791259766
I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my word	107.2147445678711
Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to you	117.9295883178711
Believe me my lord it will be your best plan	134.09552001953125
Come said Mazarin conducting DArtagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait there	70.61426544189453
He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume	185.2315673828125
Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	66.01647186279297
She was still exceedingly handsome	57.9002685546875
It is you Monsieur DArtagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing me	55.48979187011719
I ought to ask your majestys pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own mouth	68.33222198486328
Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you	134.90155029296875
With gratitude	68.55176544189453
Very well be here at midnight	41.910125732421875
I will not fail	51.01044845581055
Monsieur dArtagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the first	65.892333984375
Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said DArtagnan bowing	111.53424072265625
Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight	42.838314056396484
And DArtagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper	252.27096557617188
Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed him	81.74732971191406
In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man	94.50399780273438
DArtagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anteroom	313.1417541503906
He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly	80.0860366821289
Quite alone he asked	136.44039916992188
Yes my lord	14.703051567077637
And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society	29.664703369140625
Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais Royal	176.92837524414062
And we start in his carriage then	389.40618896484375
Yes my lord	77.66155242919922
And with us no other escort but you two	29.742263793945312
Is it not enough One of us would suffice	82.03863525390625
Really my dear Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me	134.4719696044922
I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence	352.39703369140625
And Bernouindo I not take him with me	92.27864074707031
There is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence	385.2455139160156
Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you wish	251.34976196289062
My lord there is time to draw back said DArtagnan and your eminence is perfectly free	2003.75341796875
Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be off	77.2707748413086
And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of DArtagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling	94.70442962646484
At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate	32.71133041381836
Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole	244.48399353027344
Give it to me said DArtagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate	35.69491958618164
The steps were already down and the door open	488.4150085449219
Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the carriage	232.75733947753906
Mount my lord said DArtagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding	40.821678161621094
DArtagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans	115.65607452392578
He had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but DArtagnan had said to him	63.51748275756836
Remain if you like my dear Monsieur Mouston but I warn you that Paris will be burnt down tonight upon which Mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and Monsieur dArtagnan to the end of the world	22.415189743041992
The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	55.049644470214844
The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	411.9541931152344
On his left was Porthos whilst DArtagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side	90.93896484375
Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of Porthos and the other of DArtagnan	35.65742874145508
About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the carriage	132.56884765625
Who goes asked the captain	54.774139404296875
Mazarin replied DArtagnan bursting into a laugh	22.58989715576172
The cardinals hair stood on end	120.12831115722656
But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence	194.34829711914062
A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	84.0796127319336
Hem said DArtagnan what does my lord think of that reply	136.0823974609375
Man of talent cried Mazarin	18.257240295410156
In truth said Porthos I understand but now	143.70970153808594
About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second patrol	66.75226593017578
Who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	160.8118438720703
Keep back my lord said DArtagnan	43.923038482666016
And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them	65.88709259033203
Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst DArtagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads	119.26868438720703
But putting his head out of the carriage	72.94367980957031
Eh Planchet said he	12.894065856933594
The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet DArtagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant	85.76561737060547
How sir said Planchet is it you	16.146696090698242
Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint Cloud	94.00650787353516
Oh really said Planchet	73.61140441894531
Porthos said DArtagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planchet	20.651531219482422
Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me	12.248880386352539
Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen	12.894065856933594
I will tell you all about it replied Mousqueton	119.65814971923828
Porthos uttered a deep groan	211.901611328125
Make way for us Planchet said DArtagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend	54.29635238647461
Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look ill	394.83856201171875
Then he exclaimed turning to his men	190.8115997314453
Let them pass they are friends	10.695231437683105
The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	37.466793060302734
Bricconi muttered he	77.38817596435547
A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of illlooking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eustache	238.71189880371094
Attention Porthos cried DArtagnan	20.930917739868164
Porthos placed his hand on the pistols	28.786420822143555
What is it asked Mazarin	61.19474792480469
My lord I think we are in bad company	61.70747375488281
A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	238.1755828857422
Qui vive he asked	110.01050567626953
Eh rascal said DArtagnan do you not recognize his highness the princes carriage	49.837345123291016
Prince or not said the man open	2.524933338165283
We are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass	16.44571304321289
What is to be done said Porthos	78.9691390991211
Pardieu pass replied DArtagnan	116.5135498046875
But how asked Mazarin	58.80940246582031
Through or over coachman gallop on	21.226266860961914
The coachman raised his whip	99.2598876953125
Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your horses	28.649982452392578
Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each	68.10851287841797
I will pay you two hundred for them said Mazarin	2.524933338165283
Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next	61.63398742675781
If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him	274.068115234375
Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity	213.4552459716797
I can do it said Porthos	60.61799621582031
Come and open then cried DArtagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle	64.78399658203125
And as the man approached DArtagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	87.43817901611328
Without doubt he recognized DArtagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	76.61112213134766
Monsieur dArtagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur dArtagnan let him pass	77.07764434814453
DArtagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard	88.34127044677734
The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his man	80.73359680175781
DArtagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	29.145551681518555
Sdeath cried he to the coachman	80.20159912109375
Spur your horses whip get on	57.205955505371094
The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body	60.36382293701172
There was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	98.85076141357422
To Cours la Reine cried DArtagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance	91.97486877441406
You are safeyou are free	27.71169090270996
Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle	66.39698028564453
Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Reine	54.85668182373047
Is my lord pleased with his escort asked DArtagnan	77.98297882080078
Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the queen	631.6754150390625
It will not be so difficult replied DArtagnan springing to the ground	515.1561889648438
Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your care	53.82033157348633
Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which DArtagnan took and shook in his	125.4415054321289
Oh cried Porthos as if in pain	97.28936004638672
DArtagnan looked with surprise at his friend	129.18231201171875
What is the matter then he asked	24.60696792602539
I think I have sprained my wrist said Porthos	113.13404083251953
The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf man	96.67412567138672
It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours	27.705724716186523
Oh mine replied DArtagnan was not a man	83.31812286376953
What was it then	30.546613693237305
It was an apparition	31.64728355407715
I charmed it away	166.47311401367188
Without further explanation DArtagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the Richelieu gate	29.301055908203125
Chapter LII	124.37496185302734
The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur	162.08245849609375
Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate DArtagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the Porte Richelieu	32.169837951660156
He was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry Down with Mazarin The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied	179.02342224121094
He walked down the Rue Richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee	187.19003295898438
He was struck by a sudden idea	392.215087890625
Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play	106.46147918701172
And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box	272.93414306640625
This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	10.074548721313477
It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said DArtagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us	261.46002197265625
He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little finger	26.036285400390625
To the Palais Royal he called out	67.19508361816406
The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master	109.20442199707031
The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch	23.160062789916992
It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	1.7159162759780884
DArtagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast	316.1645202636719
Pronounce one single word muttered DArtagnan and you are a dead man	161.36627197265625
The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring	13.472140312194824
Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom DArtagnan called by their names	82.81038665771484
Monsieur de Belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king	52.08125305175781
The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange	682.9981079101562
Then turning toward the second musketeer DArtagnan said	109.88510131835938
Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of safety	43.12779998779297
The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	43.795265197753906
DArtagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarins anteroom	52.24380874633789
Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	71.7463607788086
Well sir he said	67.8870620727539
Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe place	132.0864715576172
Where then sir	305.2936096191406
Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked	18.058351516723633
We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison	88.71781921386719
And now my good friend said DArtagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak	68.89995574951172
The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man DArtagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets	51.975120544433594
And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door	69.79271697998047
The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings service	118.2414779663086
At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one	53.29637145996094
Bythebye continued DArtagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body	556.2036743164062
The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and DArtagnan went out followed by Bernouin	75.08979034423828
Midnight struck	69.6070327758789
Lead me into the queens oratory said DArtagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a wellloaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair	172.82687377929688
Bernouin conducted DArtagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively	29.62982749938965
Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal	30.000818252563477
As we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at Cours la Reine	37.616294860839844
At ten oclock Anne of Austria had entered the kings room	342.67926025390625
Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much	58.83713912963867
Two royal pages were playing with him	107.15571594238281
Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed	77.28701782226562
The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm	227.26754760742188
Are you not going tomorrow morning at six oclock Louis to bathe at Conflans I think you wished to do so of your own accord	216.04266357421875
You are right madame said the king and I am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me	292.5216979980469
Laporte give the light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin	93.94149017333984
The queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette	166.43104553222656
Go to sleep soon Louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early	271.13873291015625
I will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but I have no inclination to sleep	130.93063354492188
Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself	208.457275390625
The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment	148.16009521484375
Her ladiesthat is to say Madame de Bregy Mademoiselle de Beaumont Madame de Motteville and Socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	81.1851577758789
The queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to ValdeGrace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her	63.29462432861328
When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom	69.52777862548828
Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	71.79906463623047
The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her	154.0223846435547
It was at this moment DArtagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after them	38.231563568115234
A few minutes after twelve oclock Bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret corridor	95.38186645507812
Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself	26.75741958618164
She was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	43.110572814941406
It is you Bernouin she said	96.06690216064453
Is Monsieur dArtagnan there	96.005859375
Yes madame in your oratory	93.5257797241211
He is waiting till your majesty is ready	76.52262115478516
I am	52.09124755859375
Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to me	77.96929168701172
Bernouin bowed and retired	98.07569885253906
The queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of Venetian crystal She saw DArtagnan who stood expecting her	16.66034698486328
Is it you she said	1347.8055419921875
Yes madame	85.92546844482422
Are you ready	66.99161529541016
I am	192.3080596923828
And his eminence the cardinal	22.01621437072754
Has got off without any accident	305.22021484375
He is awaiting your majesty at Cours la Reine	56.785953521728516
But in what carriage do we start	98.8609390258789
I have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty	38.90156936645508
Let us go to the king	216.0071258544922
DArtagnan bowed and followed the queen	23.851608276367188
The young Louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming Laporte with questions who replied only in these words Sire it is by the queens commands	16.939098358154297
The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen	25.771181106567383
It was one of the results of Mazarins niggardliness	29.052461624145508
The queen entered and DArtagnan remained at the door	74.43572235107422
As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her	147.912109375
Anne then motioned to DArtagnan to approach and he obeyed	459.00262451171875
My son said Anne of Austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is Monsieur dArtagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women	370.0193176269531
Remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service	380.7372741699219
The young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated	73.86798095703125
Monsieur dArtagnan	15.315829277038574
That is it my son	14.671692848205566
The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	61.92636489868164
Monsieur dArtagnan repeated Louis very well madame	61.20440673828125
At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching	91.99513244628906
What is that exclaimed the queen	37.83154296875
Oh oh replied DArtagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution	55.260414123535156
We must fly said the queen	131.8463897705078
Your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want	57.525779724121094
Monsieur dArtagnan	32.90945053100586
I will answer for everything	39.96547317504883
Nothing is so catching as confidence	43.192420959472656
The queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others	11.367436408996582
Do as you like she said I rely upon you	37.715572357177734
Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business	72.11119079589844
Command sir	52.190460205078125
What do the people want this time demanded the king	31.80703353881836
We are about to ascertain sire replied DArtagnan as he rapidly left the room	39.35846710205078
The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal entirely	55.811038970947266
Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	65.73037719726562
It was evident that there was clamor and sedition	68.07026672363281
The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting	436.4248046875
Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran in	128.23617553710938
He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queens disposal	69.10714721679688
Well asked Anne of Austria when DArtagnan reappeared what does it mean	455.33319091796875
It means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the Palais Royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the Palais Royal	156.41416931152344
Oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and I will prove to them I have not left	20.46724510192871
DArtagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent command	8.005338668823242
He approached her and said in a low voice	73.9628677368164
Has your majesty still confidence in me	95.35572052001953
This voice startled her	52.82360076904297
Yes sir she replied every confidence speak	237.70846557617188
Will the queen deign to follow my advice	40.3826789855957
Let your majesty dismiss M	60.90651321411133
de Comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables	61.75442123413086
Comminges glanced at DArtagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	47.65391540527344
You hear Comminges said the queen	85.43768310546875
DArtagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance	34.85024642944336
Monsieur de Comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not It is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness	22.32302474975586
Comminges bowed and left	45.39546585083008
Come said DArtagnan to himself I have got one more enemy	135.61236572265625
And now said the queen addressing DArtagnan what is to be done for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases	53.0154914855957
Madame said DArtagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him	40.3846549987793
What must see him Whereon the balcony	88.51799011230469
Not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed	28.216936111450195
Oh your majesty exclaimed Laporte Monsieur dArtagnan is right	223.40591430664062
The queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger	83.18762969970703
Without doubt she murmured	92.64652252197266
Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him	293.57403564453125
But not every one a deputation of two or four people	116.8001937866211
Every one madame	16.99835777282715
But reflect they will keep us here till daybreak	65.21624755859375
It shall take but a quarter of an hour I answer for everything madame believe me I know the people they are like a great child who only wants humoring	173.5843048095703
Before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs	47.78264617919922
Go Laporte said the queen	2.000459671020508
The young king approached his mother and said Why do as these people ask	86.57288360595703
It must be so my son said Anne of Austria	141.43556213378906
But if they say it must be to me am I no longer king	186.40647888183594
The queen remained silent	79.65570831298828
Sire said DArtagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question	61.505332946777344
Louis XIV	116.4580078125
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	76.52740478515625
But the queen pressed the childs hand	22.75732421875
Yes sir	342.8908996582031
he said	74.1623306274414
Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder	62.764461517333984
Yes certainly	26.105348587036133
Well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire	42.36240005493164
You must do so	32.675323486328125
Certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of God	70.73089599609375
Well then sire continued DArtagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder	10.806293487548828
In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased	43.42279815673828
Hold sire said DArtagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king	48.498477935791016
The queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute	220.48731994628906
Laporte entered	105.2291488647461
Well Laporte asked the queen	47.31196212768555
Madame he replied Monsieur dArtagnans prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment	60.73998260498047
The doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here	56.77070999145508
Laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time	106.22872924804688
If your majesty desires it said Laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service	151.04144287109375
Not at all said DArtagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost	289.01995849609375
You are right sir always right said Anne of Austria	67.47989654541016
Laporte place the king in bed	89.27398681640625
Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet	44.91166305541992
The queen bent over him and kissed his brow	93.31925201416016
Pretend to sleep Louis said she	68.41790771484375
Yes said the king but I do not wish to be touched by any of those men	62.897396087646484
Sire I am here said DArtagnan and I give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it	291.3437194824219
And now what is to be done asked the queen for I hear them	119.60110473632812
Monsieur Laporte go to them and again recommend silence	222.435546875
Madame wait at the door whilst I shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to die for him	215.0815887451172
Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst DArtagnan glided behind the curtains	18.612565994262695
Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips	112.10267639160156
On seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	197.5596923828125
Enter gentlemen enter said the queen	126.37123107910156
There was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	19.14623260498047
They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards	162.96926879882812
The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	163.29396057128906
The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back	81.08189392089844
Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to do	26.516923904418945
Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe	52.201900482177734
This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers	143.46856689453125
Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see	15.029928207397461
DArtagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planchet	307.489013671875
Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you myself	162.94635009765625
Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away	53.917606353759766
No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	85.03985595703125
You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive DArtagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire	40.764808654785156
I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but	90.56451416015625
But what asked Anne of Austria	16.55587387084961
Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there	61.074554443359375
Anne of Austria started	88.08527374267578
If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there	39.504608154296875
A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked	206.31820678710938
For one second DArtagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and DArtagnan recognized the coadjutor	95.57640838623047
It is certainly the king said the man rising again	127.02188873291016
God bless his majesty	104.30171966552734
Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn	82.52062225341797
Now said Planchet let us thank the queen	112.34342956542969
My friends retire	261.4598693847656
They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered	27.16206932067871
Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave	166.1802978515625
The queen stopped him	803.423828125
What is your name my friend she said	6.761612415313721
Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back	76.58277893066406
Yes continued the queen I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and I wish to know your name	59.226375579833984
Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a prince	147.0087890625
No thank you	194.33580017089844
DArtagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to him	391.7188415527344
Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your service	149.62918090820312
Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business	639.4905395507812
Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais	48.48529815673828
That is all I wished to know said the queen	47.4681396484375
Much obliged to you Monsieur Dulaurier	45.879661560058594
You will hear again from me	64.55473327636719
Come come thought DArtagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school	376.2830810546875
The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door DArtagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away	82.04884338378906
The queen breathed more freely	58.098480224609375
DArtagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us go	30.460556030273438
At this moment Laporte reappeared	214.8501434326172
Well asked the queen	130.7487030029297
Well madame replied the valet I followed them as far as the gates	1.679030418395996
They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy	106.70833587646484
Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise this	91.80284881591797
Then turning to DArtagnan she said	444.9109802246094
Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever received	65.32337188720703
Continue and say what we must do now	78.1883316040039
Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan finish dressing his majesty	202.17691040039062
We may go then asked the queen	50.5023307800293
Whenever your majesty pleases	276.56427001953125
You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door	142.7206573486328
Go sir said the queen I will follow you	351.383056640625
DArtagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box	37.2398681640625
DArtagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat	81.77275085449219
It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondys coachman	321.1369934082031
He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box	179.78196716308594
Sir said DArtagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	38.78571319580078
You must mount your horse and proceed to the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of Monsieur du Vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave Paris bringing them with you to Cours la Reine	123.66920471191406
If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germain	39.114627838134766
On the kings service	59.48883819580078
The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received	76.89329528808594
DArtagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	127.32072448730469
The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke dAnjou his brother	61.12630081176758
Monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling back	90.27366638183594
Yes madame said DArtagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive you	141.3497314453125
The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side	80.59474182128906
Come Laporte said the queen	70.24642181396484
How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties	26.439289093017578
It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	34.2601203918457
Get in Laporte	277.4989929199219
Laporte obeyed	79.6766357421875
Pull down the blinds said DArtagnan	26.73375129699707
But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen	24.640531539916992
Your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer ready	96.56733703613281
The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richelieu	42.31446075439453
On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand	82.19832611083984
DArtagnan signed to them to draw near	83.38370513916016
Do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant	45.373905181884766
No replied the latter	219.15768432617188
Look at the arms	28.78759002685547
The sergeant put the lantern near the panel	15.602397918701172
They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said	94.28849029541016
Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee	46.932106018066406
The sergeant began to laugh	6.245054244995117
Open the gate he cried	96.6762924194336
I know who it is Then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said	71.78697967529297
I wish you joy my lord	86.50706481933594
Impudent fellow cried DArtagnan you will get me turned off	56.0475959777832
The gate groaned on its hinges and DArtagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal	66.0276107788086
Mousqueton exclaimed DArtagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys carriage	66.5915298461914
It is he cried Porthos	57.164100646972656
Disguised as a coachman exclaimed Mazarin	179.78187561035156
And driving the coadjutors carriage said the queen	50.98680877685547
Corpo di Dio Monsieur dArtagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in gold	66.86549377441406
Chapter LIII	44.333404541015625
How DArtagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw	554.38330078125
Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her	30.5050048828125
However she offered the cardinal Laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other	61.052833557128906
It was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave Paris by night had been circulated	149.29783630371094
Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated	40.7271842956543
Besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets	12.665288925170898
The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Cond with the princess and dowager princess	106.56702423095703
Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about	35.61090087890625
The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abb de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brotherinlaw of Cond	212.0865936279297
They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach	537.4922485351562
The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said	78.35707092285156
But where is Madame de Longueville	65.99679565429688
Ah yes where is my sister asked the prince	22.298973083496094
Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty	200.7499542236328
Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	124.4207534790039
What do you say of this asked the queen	82.3121109008789
I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the cardinal	96.83250427246094
Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	72.687744140625
Silence whispered the duke she has her reasons	83.78916931152344
She will ruin us returned the prince	14.650736808776855
She will save us said Conti	146.8872833251953
Carriages now arrived in crowds those of the Marechal de Villeroy Guitant Villequier and Comminges came into the line	7.300132751464844
The two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of DArtagnan and Porthos in their hands	146.87110900878906
These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing DArtagnan on the coachbox of the royal coach	114.69721984863281
Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of antiquity	214.6331787109375
The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	50.55478286743164
Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatigued	58.18040466308594
As for me replied Porthos I am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the Parisians are idiots	71.22818756103516
Or rather we are very clever said DArtagnan	78.32666015625
And how is your wrist	48.331844329833984
Better but do you think that we ve got them this time	119.00071716308594
Got what	33.91474151611328
You your command and I my title	85.47655487060547
Ifaith yesI should expect so besides if they forget I shall take the liberty of reminding them	78.8700180053711
The queens voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horseback	260.3598327636719
Oh she would like it but	102.65593719482422
But what	95.87003326416016
The cardinal wo nt allow it	2.000459671020508
Gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings	103.30293273925781
DArtagnan started off for Saint Germain followed by Porthos	122.34474182128906
We will go on gentlemen said the queen	115.15206146240234
And the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen	77.59347534179688
They reached Saint German without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bareheaded to offer her his hand	209.69589233398438
What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen radiant	27.857099533081055
It is war said the prince	203.5614776611328
Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens	59.869224548339844
The prince bowed low	51.15760803222656
It was then three oclock in the morning	45.869380950927734
The queen walked first every one followed her	303.40826416015625
About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	86.04039001464844
Gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is large and there will be no want of room for you all but as we never thought of coming here I am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me	47.260902404785156
And one for the cardinal muttered the prince	61.474609375
Am Iam I then to sleep on the floor asked Gaston dOrleans with a forced smile	43.8333740234375
No my prince replied Mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness	100.9071273803711
But your eminence replied the prince	37.37468338012695
I answered Mazarin I shall not sleep at all I have work to do	53.879695892333984
Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose	136.13243103027344
Well for my part I shall go to bed said DArtagnan come Porthos	103.81254577636719
Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend	44.780609130859375
They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at DArtagnan who was counting on his fingers	62.27058792114258
Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles	149.89840698242188
Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles	102.71836853027344
A pistole is not enough said DArtagnan tis worth a louis	420.08526611328125
What is worth a louis	91.82675170898438
Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis	71.96958923339844
Four hundred said Porthos	75.32228088378906
Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred	416.5509033203125
But four hundred what	50.95421600341797
Listen cried DArtagnan	90.14302825927734
But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends ear	129.32025146484375
I understand answered Porthos I understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say	18.701004028320312
Let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it	8.903324127197266
But who will distribute these things asked Porthos	103.02843475341797
Is nt Mousqueton there	268.6265869140625
But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porthos	103.9404296875
He can turn his coat inside out	41.460975646972656
You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice	69.42786407470703
DArtagnan smiled	38.62648010253906
The two friends turned down the first street they came to	105.34115600585938
Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst DArtagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	33.459075927734375
Some straw they said	506.0019836425781
Sir we do nt keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealers	34.51401138305664
Where is the hay dealers	49.56378936767578
At the last large door in the street	4767.51171875
Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw	57.68820571899414
Yes there s the landlord of the Lamb and GrosLouis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursulines	82.80130767822266
Very well	66.29390716552734
DArtagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each	32.28830337524414
He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	104.73780822753906
Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty	56.60662841796875
There was no more to be had in Saint Germain	122.26374053955078
This foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	301.1816711425781
Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	83.05192565917969
He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis	139.97508239746094
DArtagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp beds	109.57942199707031
The lieutenants entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawingroom but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water	48.52033615112305
Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found	73.69960021972656
I can show you answered the Gascon	104.74250030517578
And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece	23.422000885009766
It was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep	49.360164642333984
DArtagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	42.30186080932617
At five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had	355.5636901855469
DArtagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use	59.929832458496094
He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself	196.72344970703125
Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner	69.68762969970703
DArtagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis	160.8442840576172
Porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself	107.09793853759766
He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	34.33214569091797
He then repaired to DArtagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	44.7318229675293
DArtagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with him	20.568382263183594
He laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him	34.204689025878906
He was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	102.2387924194336
Monsieur dArtagnan it cried	152.331298828125
Here cried Porthos here	3.0082876682281494
Porthos foresaw that if DArtagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed	116.4602279663086
An officer approached	37.186439514160156
I am come to fetch you Monsieur dArtagnan	142.78294372558594
From whom	109.95895385742188
His eminence sent me	93.82545471191406
Tell my lord that I m going to sleep and I advise him as a friend to do the same	5.057197570800781
His eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly	70.1923828125
The devil take Mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time	74.12976837158203
What does he want with me Is it to make me a captain In that case I will forgive him	58.59202575683594
And the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst Porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him	21.992162704467773
Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him I have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	51.86874771118164
I am going to prove to you that I have not	15.8364896774292
Good thought the Gascon this is a promising beginning	808.9166259765625
Monsieur dArtagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain	137.973876953125
Yes my lord	20.351377487182617
And your friend still longs to be made a baron	40.760826110839844
At this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already	57.32424545288086
Then said Mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown DArtagnan take this dispatch and carry it to England	1152.418212890625
DArtagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it	84.1888198852539
Am I not to know to whom to present it	131.2941131591797
You will know when you reach London at London you may tear off the outer envelope	103.32268524169922
And what are my instructions	18.97547721862793
To obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed	59.74773406982422
You must set out for Boulogne	133.68048095703125
At the Royal Arms of England you will find a young gentleman named Mordaunt	57.300148010253906
Yes my lord and what am I to do with this young gentleman	33.409339904785156
Follow wherever he leads you	98.56910705566406
DArtagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air	341.77337646484375
There are your instructions said Mazarin go	62.868309020996094
Go tis easy to say so but that requires money and I have nt any	21.103452682495117
Ah replied Mazarin so you have no money	95.64073181152344
None my lord	18.024940490722656
But the diamond I gave you yesterday	147.2281494140625
I wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence	112.74698638916016
Mazarin sighed	94.51570892333984
Tis very dear living in England my lord especially as envoy extraordinary	65.19911193847656
Zounds replied Mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter	19.913105010986328
He opened a drawer and took out a purse	227.45217895507812
What do you say to a thousand crowns	185.3609161376953
DArtagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner	26.51763343811035
I reply my lord tis but little as certainly I shall not go alone	115.9498291015625
I suppose not	45.93914031982422
Monsieur du Vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan there s not a man in France that I esteem and love so much as him	15.791143417358398
Then my lord replied DArtagnan pointing to the purse which Mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much youunderstand me	47.9970817565918
Be it so on his account I add two hundred crowns	49.54554748535156
Scoundrel muttered DArtagnan	37.33750915527344
But on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and I depend on having he his barony and I my promotion	438.3249816894531
On the honor of Mazarin	66.98308563232422
I should like another sort of oath better said DArtagnan to himself then aloud May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen	79.93064880371094
Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied Mazarin go pray sir	21.92267608642578
One word more my lord if there s any fighting where I m going must I fight	68.48253631591797
You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed the inclosed letter	34.601383209228516
Tis well said DArtagnan holding out his hand to receive the money	47.14109802246094
I offer my best respects and services to you my lord	32.37190246582031
DArtagnan then returning to the officer said	83.330322265625
Sir have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to say tis by his eminences order and that I shall await him at the stables	104.57672119140625
The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter	125.93775939941406
Porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder	166.1131134033203
I come from the cardinal said the officer	38.980812072753906
Heigho said Porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say	224.10092163085938
That his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur dArtagnan is waiting for you in the stables	434.51446533203125
Porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well	39.562538146972656
No sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately	34.62794876098633
It was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans who slept gratuitously	8.290038108825684
Chapter LIV	126.17933654785156
In which we hear Tidings of Aramis	1288.552734375
DArtagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	145.664794921875
He found his horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger	181.72926330566406
He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes	33.00274658203125
It was Mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	42.918331146240234
Mousqueton cried DArtagnan let us be off Let us set off	157.62867736816406
Mousqueton recognizing the voice of his masters friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night	112.02204132080078
Ho ho exclaimed DArtagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis that smells confoundedly of straw	461.8241882324219
Mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him and said	23.22014045715332
Porthos would be angry my dear Monsieur Mousqueton but I pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gaycome along	35.00669479370117
Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	170.02455139160156
Whilst this went on Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost merry	161.8531494140625
Ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and I my barony	381.58990478515625
We are going to fetch our brevets said DArtagnan and when we come back Master Mazarin will sign them	208.2861785888672
And where are we going asked Porthos	60.073463439941406
To Paris first I have affairs to settle	164.6618194580078
And they both set out for Paris	161.0048065185547
On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital	25.958406448364258
Around a brokendown carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisonersthat is to say an old man and two women	74.49488830566406
On the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own	36.536155700683594
What is the king doing they asked	209.03648376464844
He is asleep	7.815841197967529
And the Spanish woman	152.73460388183594
And the cursed Italian	209.3164520263672
He is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away its for some purpose rely on it	257.91656494140625
But as you are the strongest after all continued DArtagnan do nt be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions	14.296833038330078
The people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked DArtagnan with an eloquent look	205.29112243652344
Now onward cried the Gascon	22.932601928710938
And they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned	23.064144134521484
In the place of the Palais Royal DArtagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens	13.472140312194824
It was Planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont	84.23218536376953
In passing before DArtagnan he recognized his former master	13.472140312194824
Goodday Monsieur dArtagnan said Planchet proudly	25.073463439941406
Goodday Monsieur Dulaurier replied DArtagnan	95.8299560546875
Planchet stopped short staring at DArtagnan	84.88890075683594
The first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last	82.65101623535156
These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed DArtagnan to Porthos and went on his way	22.202749252319336
Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette where pretty Madeleine the hostess came to him	24.977502822875977
My dear Mistress Turquaine said the Gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors do nt pay them	37.468650817871094
Why prithee asked Madeleine	73.04315948486328
Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell	130.21368408203125
And are you going to leave me at such a time	70.4029541015625
This very instant	128.86541748046875
And where are you going	20.646034240722656
Ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service	63.38616943359375
Ah me ah me	91.67135620117188
Have you any letters for me inquired DArtagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief	32.53261184692383
There s one just arrived and she handed the letter to DArtagnan	76.56945037841797
From Athos cried DArtagnan recognizing the handwriting	24.961502075195312
Ah said Porthos let us hear what he says	27.256521224975586
DArtagnan opened the letter and read as follows	137.76226806640625
Dear DArtagnan dear Du Vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	33.928497314453125
Aramis and I are very unhappy but God our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	207.2003936767578
Think often of Raoul	18.721179962158203
I intrust to you certain papers which are at Blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	62.01622772216797
Embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend	43.94367218017578
I believe by Heaven said DArtagnan that I shall embrace him since he s upon our road and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear Athos from that very day he becomes my son	70.94062042236328
And I said Porthos shall make him my sole heir	233.9984893798828
Let us see what more does Athos say	332.4677429199219
Should you meet on your journey a certain Monsieur Mordaunt distrust him in a letter I can not say more	149.9897918701172
Monsieur Mordaunt exclaimed the Gascon surprised	44.32829284667969
Monsieur Mordaunt tis well said Porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from Aramis	198.83706665039062
So there is said DArtagnan and he read	57.240421295166016
We conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it	9285.2890625
Confound it interrupted Porthos with an explosion of passion which sent Mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying	33.90203857421875
DArtagnan continued	58.942440032958984
Athos bequeaths to you Raoul and I bequeath to you my revenge	34.00944519042969
If by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt tell Porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck	32.0119514465332
I dare not say more in a letter	47.0140495300293
If that is all it is easily done said Porthos	156.5937957763672
On the contrary observed DArtagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible	40.25703430175781
How so	29.980817794799805
It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to England	30.510177612304688
Well suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said Porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army	103.90286254882812
I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark	78.7282943725586
True said Porthos	22.887243270874023
And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	193.24778747558594
As to DArtagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face	198.68893432617188
Ah this is not right Athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad	135.56936645507812
Mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	312.49005126953125
Come said DArtagnan all this leads to nothing	2.000459671020508
Let us go on	37.25234603881836
We will embrace Raoul and perhaps he will have news of Athos	194.44061279296875
Stopan idea cried Porthos indeed my dear DArtagnan I do nt know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace Raoul	86.34354400634766
Woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said Mousqueton to himself I would nt give a farthing for his life	167.48350524902344
They set out	987.8997802734375
On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	137.3973846435547
It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with joy	86.4873046875
With the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	55.49034881591797
The two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the Saint Denis gate	199.49017333984375
Is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the Duc de Beaufort has arrived in Paris	87.17124938964844
Nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said DArtagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the Duc de Vendome his father who is coming in his turn	64.02167510986328
Long live De Beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass	96.03351593017578
Once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear	71.76480102539062
Their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis	132.7991485595703
The camp had entered Saint Omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen	12.98993968963623
They found Raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young mans eyes were red and he seemed dejected	92.23825073242188
The Marechal de Grammont and the Comte de Guiche had returned to Paris and he was quite lonely	80.9252700805664
And as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	50.77876663208008
Oh is it you dear friends Did you come here to fetch me Will you take me away with you Do you bring me tidings of my guardian	74.9601058959961
Have you not received any said DArtagnan to the youth	44.61376953125
Alas sir no and I do not know what has become of him so that I am really so unhappy that I weep	167.95944213867188
In fact tears rolled down his cheeks	119.58587646484375
Porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind	94.0870590209961
Deuce take it cried DArtagnan more moved than he had been for a long time do nt despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one	60.75985336303711
Oh really cried Raoul	242.74754333496094
And a comforting one too added DArtagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	64.41494750976562
Have you it asked Raoul	441.2306213378906
Yesthat is I had it repined the Gascon making believe to find it	33.62180709838867
Wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not Porthos	70.16510772705078
All Gascon as he was DArtagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	122.42597961425781
Yes replied Porthos coughing	823.3114013671875
Eh give it to me said the young man	108.24185943603516
Eh I read it a little while since	56.330501556396484
Can I have lost it Ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it	76.06362915039062
Oh yes Monsieur Raoul said Mousqueton the letter was very consoling	197.8592987060547
These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy	26.0269832611084
But at any rate you know where he is Monsieur dArtagnan asked Raoul somewhat comforted	110.73616790771484
Ah that s the thing replied the Gascon	73.65508270263672
Undoubtedly I know it but it is a mystery	120.39594268798828
Not to me I hope	92.67815399169922
No not to you so I am going to tell you where he is	61.63072204589844
Porthos devoured DArtagnan with wondering eyes	6849.80810546875
Where the devil shall I say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him thought DArtagnan	39.16135787963867
Well where is he sir asked Raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	24.392475128173828
He is at Constantinople	103.23689270019531
Among the Turks exclaimed Raoul alarmed	9.046768188476562
Good heavens how can you tell me that	56.553775787353516
Does that alarm you cried DArtagnan	137.53294372558594
Pooh what are the Turks to such men as the Comte de la Fere and the Abb dHerblay	49.90989303588867
Ah his friend is with him said Raoul	63.90488815307617
That comforts me a little	54.94608688354492
Has he wit or notthis demon DArtagnan said Porthos astonished at his friends deception	41.36647415161133
Now sir said DArtagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier	125.8784408569336
I suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome	139.4705352783203
I have still twenty pistoles sir	203.06065368652344
Well take them that makes seventy	100.14893341064453
And if you wish for more said Porthos putting his hand to his pocket	92.3708267211914
Thank you sir replied Raoul blushing thank you a thousand times	154.40438842773438
At this moment Olivain appeared	15.165870666503906
Apropos said DArtagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with Olivain	44.681373596191406
Yes in some respects tolerably well	14.617755889892578
Olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent	135.2826385498047
What fault do you find with the fellow	112.7545166015625
He is a glutton	218.73538208007812
Oh sir cried Olivain reappearing at this accusation	137.40786743164062
And a little bit of a thief	132.05133056640625
Oh sir oh	182.05259704589844
And more especially a notorious coward	685.2048950195312
Oh oh sir you really vilify me cried Olivain	53.26190948486328
The deuce cried DArtagnan	74.84899139404297
Pray learn Monsieur Olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards	149.37155151367188
Rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by Jove do nt be a coward or I shall cut off your ears	9.842619895935059
Look at Monsieur Mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance	108.39065551757812
Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced DArtagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself	51.50027847290039
Send away that fellow Raoul said the Gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day	227.6573486328125
Monsieur says I am coward cried Olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in Grammonts regiment and I refused to accompany him	47.4681396484375
Monsieur Olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said DArtagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him Thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong heres a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him I will cut out thy tongue	94.24677276611328
Remember that	74.24845123291016
Olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	8.476186752319336
And now Raoul said the Gascon Monsieur du Vallon and I are going away as ambassadors where I know not but should you want anything write to Madame Turquaine at La Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a bankerwith economy for it is not so well filled as that of Monsieur dEmery	37.95458221435547
And having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of Porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant	117.30319213867188
Come said DArtagnan let us go	64.74879455566406
And they set out for Boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration	62.458892822265625
At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them	175.25967407226562
DArtagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said	103.47809600830078
Well friend I do nt like people to quiz me	210.33950805664062
Sir said the young man do you not come from Paris if you please	106.72604370117188
DArtagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	159.54144287109375
Yes sir he said in a softened tone	104.6705093383789
Are you not going to put up at the Arms of England	156.74246215820312
Yes sir	62.69473648071289
Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence Cardinal Mazarin	174.3600311279297
Yes sir	59.008052825927734
In that case I am the man you have to do with	115.26951599121094
I am M	19.341062545776367
Ah thought DArtagnan the man I am warned against by Athos	53.47195816040039
Ah thought Porthos the man Aramis wants me to strangle	422.40789794921875
They both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	36.85682678222656
Do you doubt my word he said	93.34857940673828
In that case I can give you proofs	59.94126510620117
No sir said DArtagnan and we place ourselves at your orders	25.857683181762695
Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the cardinal	65.45816802978516
My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatiently	229.14735412597656
So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are addressed	137.40786743164062
Have you no letter for him asked the young man	86.19561004638672
I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then	137.40786743164062
DArtagnan tore open the envelope of the letter	84.11096954345703
It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English Nation	1167.8270263671875
Ah said DArtagnan a singular commission	86.164794921875
Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porthos	332.1663513183594
Formerly a brewer replied the Gascon	53.45909881591797
Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porthos	111.27591705322266
Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us depart	178.8837432861328
What exclaimed Porthos without supper Can not Monsieur Cromwell wait a little	53.74578857421875
Yes but I said Mordaunt	44.3543815612793
Well you said Porthos what then	83.19918060302734
I can not wait	92.96208953857422
Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your permission	153.39015197753906
The young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	104.60135650634766
Monsieur said DArtagnan you must excuse famished travelers	40.44076919555664
Besides our supper ca nt delay you much	112.87630462646484
We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor	67.86003875732422
We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are	63.890506744384766
Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said	310.05126953125
The name of your ship inquired DArtagnan	105.85763549804688
The Standard	51.5961799621582
Very well in half an hour we shall be on board	21.77349090576172
And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of England	29.68381118774414
What do you say of that young man asked DArtagnan as they hurried along	47.36199951171875
I say that he does nt suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramiss advice	62.60675811767578
By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant	54.39280319213867
Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good advice	66.69547271728516
Listen returned DArtagnan when our embassy is finished	86.79112243652344
If it brings us back to France	93.33688354492188
Well we shall see	10.064125061035156
At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port	112.83928680419922
There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently	80.5218276977539
It is singular said DArtagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I can not yet remember	92.38505554199219
A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised anchor	19.347570419311523
The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread	272.3993835449219
Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep	55.823978424072266
DArtagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk	8.865636825561523
Mousqueton was seasick	28.034717559814453
Chapter LV	128.09408569335938
The Scotchman	64.28849792480469
And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably not toward London where DArtagnan and Porthos believed they were going but to Durham whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the Tyne near Newcastle	28.01858139038086
There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army extended	70.72634887695312
It was midnight	61.39120864868164
Some Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch	32.53105926513672
The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles I	50.81157684326172
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement	103.23516845703125
At one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the Scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by Lord Leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword	473.2032165527344
About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire dialect	45.94380569458008
As the town clock of Newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	84.4841537475586
The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	37.29678726196289
In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him	57.23362350463867
Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and Tours	111.83577728271484
Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately	209.4312744140625
Why what is the matter	38.14324188232422
It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all	164.32994079589844
We must go and find Lord Winter	135.21319580078125
They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for	148.17832946777344
Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anteroom	171.9222412109375
No monsieur le comte answered the servant I think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	71.87092590332031
However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent	91.11731719970703
Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	39.85051345825195
The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	51.688865661621094
He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to them	59.76115417480469
Have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight	184.30630493164062
No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as usual	81.68069458007812
Look again chevalier returned Lord Winter	37.6738395690918
I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la FereI can see nothing remarkable about it	200.5796356201172
My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	80.0217514038086
Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them	35.96490478515625
The Scotch inquired Winter	143.8270721435547
What Scotch	87.3006591796875
Ours egad exclaimed Athos	168.89089965820312
Those in whom the king has confidedLord Levens Highlanders	2.000459671020508
No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens	3144.060546875
Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at once	180.61871337890625
Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry IV	59.12578582763672
the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with M	63.690147399902344
de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard	13.10406494140625
Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so himself	159.1103057861328
Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry IV	40.9499626159668
was killed	87.59011840820312
But what has this vision of Henry IV	371.49017333984375
to do with you my lord inquired Aramis	36.28192901611328
Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news	114.66790771484375
Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the king	81.62506103515625
To the king but the king is asleep	27.32695960998535
I have something important to reveal to him	113.4869155883789
Can it not be put off till tomorrow	150.2122344970703
He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late	28.81180763244629
Come then said Lord Winter	113.86972045898438
Lord Winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	280.7095642089844
This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject	41.181819915771484
These gentlemen are with me said Winter	59.18434143066406
The lackey bowed and let them pass	72.19131469726562
As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue	129.1087188720703
They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	101.25309753417969
Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	238.6317901611328
He opened his eyes	41.2672004699707
Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere	42.474178314208984
Yes sire replied Athos	80.79786682128906
You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news	64.59959411621094
Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed aright	148.8167266845703
It is bad news	36.68870544433594
Yes sire	29.602479934692383
Never mind the messenger is welcome	246.88333129882812
You never come to me without conferring pleasure	1571.429931640625
You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak out	360.8412780761719
Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at Newcastle	91.37850952148438
Ah exclaimed the king to fight	189.39991760253906
No sire but to buy your majesty	224.2118682861328
What did you say	151.47586059570312
I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish army	350.2584228515625
For unpaid wages yes I know it	21.82944679260254
For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor alone	63.53096389770508
Athos smiled	192.3970184326172
Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing them	218.6177520751953
Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain	216.37060546875
Lord Leven	39.53663635253906
Are you certain of it sir	61.80762481689453
I heard it with my own ears	77.58655548095703
The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands	50.29958724975586
Oh the Scotch he exclaimed the Scotch I called my faithful to whom I trusted myself when I could have fled to Oxford the Scotch my brothers But are you well assured sir	98.47350311279297
Lying behind the tent of Lord Leven I raised it and saw all heard all	423.2839660644531
And when is this to be consummated	96.69754791259766
Todaythis morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose	41.84367370605469
To do what since you say I am sold	270.8760070800781
To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell you	274.7707824707031
And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a king	121.66437530517578
The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you sire	92.71572875976562
No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads	15.313820838928223
Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father	165.59329223632812
I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sireit is the will of Heaven	62.32950210571289
The king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said	31.887557983398438
Well what is to be done	85.42269134521484
Sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely	25.312612533569336
Winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours	96.30567932128906
Sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked	114.67786407470703
I will not answer for them	77.85186767578125
I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majestys	127.38053131103516
Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	101.68987274169922
It is enough	47.4681396484375
Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the Tyne reach Scotland and you will be saved	36.36676788330078
Is this your counsel also Winter inquired the king	175.5140838623047
Yes sire	27.93210792541504
And yours Monsieur dHerblay	43.51211166381836
Yes sire	31.474937438964844
As you wish then	50.697994232177734
Winter give the necessary orders	353.72802734375
Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet	83.7247085571289
The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter reentered it	59.15745162963867
All is ready sire said he	132.76963806152344
For us also inquired Athos	43.934173583984375
Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled	113.05196380615234
In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set off	29.803422927856445
Come added the king	143.28109741210938
Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this	216.5868682861328
Friends answered Charles sadly I have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom I shall never forget	233.10888671875
Come gentlemen come	134.3827362060547
The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him	294.3811950683594
It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond	65.98855590820312
The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him	125.76714324951172
Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves me	236.78829956054688
You at least will be faithful to me Arthur	143.80848693847656
The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure	75.61160278320312
Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature	72.68868255615234
After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said	52.029563903808594
Now gentlemen I am at your service	116.57395935058594
But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp	467.3223876953125
What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of daybreak	482.1310729980469
What is that line I did not observe it yesterday	102.30648803710938
It must be the fog rising from the river said the king	84.92731475830078
Sire it is something more opaque than the fog	179.1724395751953
Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red color	114.5430908203125
It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Athos	122.85281372070312
The enemy cried the king	55.537044525146484
Yes the enemy	25.89112663269043
It is too late	52.61670684814453
Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides	240.79751586914062
This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his bodyguard	382.6264343261719
Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or not	79.28759765625
What are you going to do exclaimed Athos	24.53422737121582
To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels	6.3329973220825195
And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Leven	448.2125549316406
Follow him said Athos	37.88815689086914
Come exclaimed Aramis	148.8928985595703
Is the king wounded cried Lord Winter	61.18334197998047
I see spots of blood on the ground	52.99348831176758
And he set off to follow the two friends	70.35237884521484
He was stopped by Athos	365.3771057128906
Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it directly	45.16840744018555
Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on	51.35704040527344
It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and entered	88.4966812133789
The general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs	152.5172119140625
The king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment	58.91594696044922
Charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip	45.50274658203125
Yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened	292.8447570800781
What is the matter sire exclaimed Lord Leven	68.1166000366211
It is this sir said the king angrily that General Cromwell has reached Newcastle that you knew it and I was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the Tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament	116.3009033203125
Of this treaty at least I have been warned	57.359188079833984
This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse you	152.72462463378906
Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports	299.65673828125
My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty debated	54.50234603881836
The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows	53.82525634765625
Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity	83.33651733398438
I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy	430.94561767578125
That can not be sire said the earl	12.920953750610352
How can not be What hinders it exclaimed the king	209.53016662597656
Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English army	40.743316650390625
And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there	27.49828338623047
Now I tell you you must pass with me through this army across to Scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you withyou are either cowards or traitors	84.86845397949219
The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king	60.94486618041992
Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and England	200.5926513671875
We have promised and we will keep our promise	265.6456604003906
Charles Stuart you are our prisoner	100.31636047363281
And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned	148.84226989746094
Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	18.491947174072266
Then as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner Athos and Aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	50.05097961425781
On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his regiment	212.56153869628906
The king motioned him to accompany them	21.378694534301758
Chapter LVI	206.92550659179688
The Avenger	39.41456604003906
They all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of one	19.112396240234375
The king threw himself into an armchair	18.515398025512695
I am lost said he	60.97442626953125
No sire replied Athos	29.21247100830078
You are only betrayed	97.54670715332031
The king sighed deeply	1092.5718994140625
Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the English	77.8134536743164
Oh traitors that ye are	121.10911560058594
Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman	129.97906494140625
Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray you	189.66807556152344
Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of DArtagnan and Porthos	104.90129852294922
What do you say inquired Charles rising	196.0303192138672
I say sire that there is now but one way open	131.78768920898438
Lord Winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly sowe will not split straws about wordslet him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through Cromwells army and reach Scotland	72.00333404541016
There is another method said Aramis	73.23388671875
Let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	32.60993576049805
Whilst they pursue him the king might escape	95.24542999267578
It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him	302.11529541015625
What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him	30.98663902282715
I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur dHerblay	122.34468078613281
I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose	110.69994354248047
But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place	154.47885131835938
He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried Winter	138.94110107421875
The king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the Order of the Saint Esprit which he wore to honor the two Frenchmen who were with him and passed it around Winters neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereigns confidence and friendship	621.30126953125
It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we have	86.8056869506836
The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes	25.673500061035156
Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you also	52.973541259765625
He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the Garter	16.0720157623291
These can not be for us said Athos	200.2660675048828
Why not sir asked Charles	59.63612747192383
Such are for royalty and we are simple commoners	74.48856353759766
Speak not of crowns	118.50399780273438
I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours	63.13893127441406
No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you justice	125.38601684570312
On your knees count	458.5161437988281
Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a knight	31.057485580444336
Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and loyal	99.14026641845703
I knight you monsieur le comte	63.591880798339844
Then turning to Aramis he said	66.62662506103516
It is now your turn monsieur le chevalier	177.78582763671875
The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king	202.4394989013672
Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them both	55.45405960083008
Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready	92.19345092773438
The king looked at the three gentlemen	42.34103012084961
Then we must fly said he	2.000459671020508
Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called charging	21.742345809936523
Then I shall die sword in hand said Charles	26.535505294799805
Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king	60.37444305419922
Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side	101.51028442382812
But we must not lose time	51.175750732421875
We have already wasted too much	140.70791625976562
The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went out	50.37049102783203
Winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp	107.08103942871094
The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	93.02616882324219
The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array	62.90138244628906
Do you see that said the king	78.79631042480469
Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march	37.557403564453125
If they are penitent said Athos let them follow us	140.28680419921875
Well said the king what shall we do	71.64363098144531
Let us examine the enemys army	129.4265899658203
At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	64.97447204589844
The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	53.689666748046875
The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct	26.37967300415039
On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers	46.21604537963867
He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	61.23579025268555
Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aramis	78.27326965332031
Charles smiled	78.16033172607422
That man is Cromwell said he	1226.23095703125
Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution	18.728059768676758
Ah said Athos how much time we have lost	77.08261108398438
Now said the king give the word and let us start	134.6044464111328
Will you not give it sire asked Athos	399.1260681152344
No I make you my lieutenantgeneral said the king	99.39639282226562
Listen then Lord Winter	8.093596458435059
Proceed sire I beg	13.472140312194824
What we are going to say does not concern your majesty	2.1138858795166016
The king smiling turned a few steps back	380.6278076171875
This is what I propose to do said Athos	47.64595031738281
We will divide our regiments into two squadrons	28.63099479675293
You will put yourself at the head of the first	26.04737663269043
We and his majesty will lead the second	218.4281005859375
If no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemys line and throw ourselves into the Tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road	69.83543395996094
Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest	140.8566131591797
To horse said Lord Winter	98.47542572021484
To horse reechoed Athos everything is arranged and decided	56.84252166748047
Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and St	45.78285217285156
Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of traitors	144.9514617919922
They mountedthe king on Winters horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the second	50.82074737548828
The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	144.2737579345703
Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two	13.472140312194824
There said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors	74.9589614868164
At this moment Winters voice was raised with the cry of Forward	685.3294067382812
The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau	23.163354873657227
A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it	140.4580841064453
The king pointed this out	32.20287322998047
Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost	79.09610748291016
At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winters voice crying out	71.2358627319336
Sword in hand	85.04605865478516
At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	140.2427215576172
Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand	68.34639739990234
But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings example	77.23776245117188
We are betrayed said the king in a low voice	64.62397003173828
Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain	56.514068603515625
Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athoss horse	94.48196411132812
Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain	534.7913208007812
About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwells cuirassiers	79.28858184814453
Let us go and die with them said the king	61.360389709472656
Let us go said Athos and Aramis	63.27884292602539
All faithful hearts with me cried out Winter	63.53974533081055
This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop	3244.8662109375
No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them tremble	32.67411804199219
As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified	189.9580535888672
It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance	323.92974853515625
Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side	110.64881896972656
The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him alive	27.41954803466797
No it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier	169.95591735839844
Lord Winter you are not the king you are my uncle	69729.65625
At the same moment Mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at Winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos murmuring He is avenged	173.54795837402344
Think of my mother shouted Mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop	106.64810180664062
Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off	44.62855529785156
At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two Frenchmen	272.3974304199219
Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said	56.514068603515625
Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded	83.10563659667969
At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads	14.147507667541504
Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks fell upon Athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear	29.92759895324707
Silence yieldyou yield to me do you not	40.637516021728516
A giant had seized also Aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp	83.39924621582031
DArt exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his hand	108.61003112792969
I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porthos	231.8361053466797
Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	76.65906524658203
And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded	162.8726348876953
It is the son of Milady said Athos to DArtagnan	108.12635803222656
I recognize him	91.39022827148438
It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aramis	26.847476959228516
I know it	78.10173034667969
And now the ranks began to open	97.78225708007812
DArtagnan held the bridle of Athoss horse and Porthos that of Aramis	64.7486343383789
Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	11.05151081085205
This movement revealed the spot where Winters body had fallen	218.65289306640625
Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred	75.93602752685547
Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	124.34329223632812
What are you about said DArtagnan	55.995426177978516
Let me kill him	77.0050277709961
We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him	157.93150329589844
Then turning to the young man he exclaimed	184.1111297607422
A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing less	501.9206237792969
But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I imagine	60.841670989990234
Ifaith I do nt know	40.81190872192383
Are you French sir said he to Athos	178.6266632080078
I am replied the latter gravely	235.6300811767578
Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman	57.243316650390625
But the kingwhere is the king exclaimed Athos anxiously	226.28988647460938
DArtagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying	93.48363494873047
Eh the king We have secured him	64.3169174194336
Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of treason	31.32808494567871
Porthos pressed his friends hand and said to him	26.348106384277344
Yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder	91.28800964355469
At this instant the squadron that ought to have protected Charless retreat was advancing to meet the English regiments	89.6806411743164
The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space	103.3860092163086
He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort	438.85638427734375
Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it	123.33100891113281
Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant	260.2933044433594
Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself	150.20327758789062
Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him	133.54751586914062
Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mordaunt	94.6475830078125
Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by DArtagnan and Porthos	2.000459671020508
The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter	21.742345809936523
The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	45.884727478027344
In Straffords company said Mordaunt tauntingly	49.86129379272461
Charles shuddered	377.92535400390625
The demon had known how to wound him	69.93229675292969
The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night	86.4640884399414
The king looked around him	76.22341918945312
He saw a corpse at his feet	108.79802703857422
It was Winters	48.230224609375
He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winters head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own breast	52.95264434814453
Lord Winter is killed then inquired DArtagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse	181.7790069580078
Yes said Athos by his own nephew	75.6166763305664
Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said DArtagnan	60.847442626953125
Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner	128.64553833007812
Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force	161.27488708496094
Your sword	307.5828552246094
The king drew his sword and broke it on his knee	121.79021453857422
At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was Arthur	78.85851287841797
The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle	127.22975158691406
Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will	36.56490707397461
Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him	237.71607971191406
Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart	567.6832885742188
Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said DArtagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon	81.91788482666016
The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle	182.45323181152344
At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Cromwell	48.34075164794922
Chapter LVII	94.49800872802734
Oliver Cromwell	65.43797302246094
Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to DArtagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the action	93.77428436279297
We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied DArtagnan	61.20796585083008
Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds	300.4052734375
Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise you	51.19133377075195
I shall take better care of them myself answered DArtagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	223.4735870361328
I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence	55.04030227661133
You think of starting at once then inquired Mordaunt	1009.6469116210938
Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent	28.32353973388672
The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant	36.107460021972656
You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate	62.38483428955078
The sergeant made a sign of comprehension	117.84256744384766
Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	114.57351684570312
Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man	145.18934631347656
Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned	72.7655029296875
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not move	24.742834091186523
Mordaunt remained standing near the door	88.64086151123047
At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around	89.97576141357422
I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man	208.695556640625
They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to go	33.91279220581055
Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may remain	45.591487884521484
I come to congratulate you	49.904571533203125
To congratulate mewhat for	97.0595703125
On the capture of Charles Stuart	154.5584259033203
You are now master of England	84.20844268798828
I was much more really so two hours ago	389.44110107421875
How so general	68.5318603515625
Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken	66.14344787597656
Have you seen him	91.22695922851562
Yes sir	4.351946830749512
said Mordaunt	148.69961547851562
What is his bearing	131.1936798095703
Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth	56.421146392822266
Calm and dignified said he	117.45128631591797
What did he say	54.46813201904297
Some parting words to his friends	301.90521240234375
His friends murmured Cromwell	16.599533081054688
Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance	992.7613525390625
No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance	90.36509704589844
To whom did he give up his sword	75.10701751708984
He did not give it up he broke it	293.4273681640625
He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage	134.6954803466797
There was a momentary pause	155.7095184326172
I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mordaunt	560.8930053710938
Yes sir	85.85575866699219
By whom inquired Cromwell	142.65948486328125
By me	37.24680709838867
What was his name	65.66756439208984
Lord Winter	149.8843231201172
Your uncle exclaimed Cromwell	370.5997009277344
My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my family	81.25009155273438
Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well	63.88185501098633
Mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant	206.80368041992188
When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be disputed	94.41238403320312
Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his son	53.02182388305664
Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished	108.33759307861328
I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain	27.08125877380371
Cromwell bowed	43.750038146972656
You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave	92.78631591796875
Most fearlessly	185.44065856933594
Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the fight	105.90787506103516
They were replied Mordaunt	87.76968383789062
After you however said Cromwell	86.93965911865234
It was the fault of their horses not theirs	104.99642944335938
Another pause	161.4825897216797
And the Scotch	76.15653228759766
They kept their word and never stirred said Mordaunt	129.94088745117188
Wretched men	92.00259399414062
Their officers wish to see you sir	193.59495544433594
I have no time to see them	11.617815017700195
Are they paid	80.51349639892578
Yes tonight	63.414283752441406
Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with me	53.59164047241211
And now go Mordaunt	166.43930053710938
Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you sir	112.70087432861328
A favor from me	90.47383117675781
Mordaunt bowed	51.77268600463867
I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me	54.330509185791016
Cromwell looked at him with astonishment	16.0720157623291
The young man remained immovable	20.048616409301758
Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave soldier	131.82150268554688
Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king	56.406272888183594
Yes the idea was yours	35.58674621582031
I had no such contempt for men before	165.2459259033203
Was I not a good ambassador in France	82.4393310546875
Yes for Mazarin has granted what I desire	319.49334716796875
Have I not always fought for your glory and interests	42.371891021728516
Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you for	43.17479705810547
But what is the meaning of all these questions	13.639921188354492
To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services	42.59922409057617
Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid	64.68988037109375
Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes	86.39349365234375
How is that	72.05835723876953
I have the payment under my hand I almost possess it	145.28887939453125
What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government	122.4338607788086
Sir will you grant me my request	398.44061279296875
Let us hear what it is first	535.8567504882812
Sir when you have told me to obey an order did I ever answer Let me see that order	29.472986221313477
If however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill	61.73134231567383
When you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have I ever replied It is impossible	671.2850952148438
But a request preferred with so much preparation	174.91055297851562
Ah do not fear sir said Mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you	101.47466278076172
Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed	22.77387809753418
Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them	83.79096984863281
For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Cromwell	117.11914825439453
On the contrary I think they are poor sir	51.2926139831543
They are friends of yours then	55.9586181640625
Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for them	34.068973541259766
Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with them	161.73904418945312
Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services	134.2400360107422
He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it	69.08658599853516
What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank	46.217159271240234
You have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is paid	32.526493072509766
And Mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy	1041.5301513671875
Cromwell gazed a moment after him	235.2815704345703
He has slain his uncle he murmured	84.7056884765625
Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	85.97096252441406
Nobody serves me for nothing	74.92390441894531
Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none	61.97052764892578
And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mordaunt	59.05660629272461
Chapter LVIII	39.34038162231445
Jesus Seigneur	24.175020217895508
Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwells tent DArtagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at Newcastle	69.79198455810547
The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by DArtagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution	50.455360412597656
The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts	136.09115600585938
It would be impossible to describe Mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	1134.3590087890625
He rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him Athos and Aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of Porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute	166.39303588867188
Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence	82.0135269165039
What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another	62.451026916503906
The house to which DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	39.735435485839844
It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden	49.10009765625
The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	404.7402038574219
The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable	101.01053619384766
Why do nt we go in with them asked Porthos	151.43447875976562
We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied DArtagnan	104.09583282470703
The sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden	106.3641128540039
DArtagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	269.911865234375
We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners	56.306575775146484
There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received DArtagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwells health	75.36685943603516
The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket	27.3442440032959
Ah said Porthos what a fearful day my dear DArtagnan	95.32726287841797
What a fearful day when today we find our friends	107.2467041015625
Yes but under what circumstances	95.83941650390625
Tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done	279.8587341308594
Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt	31.070106506347656
Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that name	120.94902801513672
But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all English	108.25264739990234
DArtagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity	92.43123626708984
But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go in	74.99382019042969
They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at DArtagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	34.90614318847656
You want to know how we came here Tis easily guessed	176.9938507080078
Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Cromwell	17.279922485351562
But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Athos	99.36834716796875
And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aramis	97.97917175292969
Mazarin again	198.7677764892578
Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin	48.91944122314453
Mazarin sent us to Cromwell	86.1981201171875
There is a certain fatality in it	131.82647705078125
Yes you are right DArtagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny	66.04723358154297
Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides	27.220888137817383
Yes added Athos I now ask you DArtagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you	77.73001098632812
Do you know in what crime you are today engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his murder	30.3446102142334
Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so	74.52046203613281
You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant	53.4951171875
Good heavens we are on the very eve of it	95.89358520507812
I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave	127.96974182128906
Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of it	37.101158142089844
I do nt maintain the contrary said DArtagnan	50.41792297363281
But what s that to us I am here because I am a soldier and have to obey ordersI have taken an oath to obey and I do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent	111.01685333251953
That most sacred in the world said Athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty	115.5827407836914
A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid	38.56769561767578
We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of power	80.5759506225586
You may see matters differently DArtagnan and think otherwise	151.4517364501953
I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame you	48.22806167602539
Heyday cried DArtagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell who s an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a Frenchman	53.5822639465332
I have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible	274.1159362792969
Yes said Porthos	107.92633819580078
Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them	76.9260025024414
And you you DArtagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners	69.64903259277344
Ah DArtagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culpable	50.238525390625
DArtagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aramis	185.4178466796875
And you Porthos continued the count as if in consideration for DArtagnans embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that I knowyou with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent kingyou my dear Porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as DArtagnan	216.63375854492188
Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said	76.58441925048828
Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are right	92.40721893310547
Athos arose	32.6046028137207
Come he said stretching out his hand to DArtagnan come do nt be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father	74.75820922851562
It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this	37.73370361328125
Doubtless doubtless Athos	29.968704223632812
But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one ca nt entertain	15.90790843963623
Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten wormeaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel	120.04344177246094
The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman	174.4173126220703
However that may be DArtagnan replied Athos without falling into the snare which his Gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but I am wrong to dispute with my master	45.800315856933594
DArtagnan I am your prisonertreat me as such	109.7021255493164
Ah pardieu said DArtagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long	319.29583740234375
No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipghauts	55.86793899536133
And how were they treated asked DArtagnan	337.088623046875
Why said Aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot	115.7918701171875
Well I said DArtagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot	95.25532531738281
Sang Diou let them come on Besidesdo you see that door Athos	14.944769859313965
Yes what then	43.59597396850586
Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air	65.59639739990234
I recognize you there my brave DArtagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our masters	204.70957946777344
That door is guarded DArtagnan you know that	115.41950225830078
Very well you will force it said Porthos	208.56802368164062
There are only a dozen men at the most	75.88597106933594
That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two	69.8524169921875
No divided as we now are we must perish	15.381893157958984
See the fatal example on the Vendomois road DArtagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today Aramis and I are beaten in our turn	89.23104858398438
Now that never happened to us when we were four together	78.3509750366211
Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly together	183.75608825683594
Impossible said DArtagnan we are under Mazarins orders	103.47276306152344
I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours	49.36190414428711
Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like DArtagnan and Porthos	183.29324340820312
Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying	128.5948944091797
As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are today	168.73634338378906
DArtagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	2.000459671020508
At last	270.4899597167969
Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our prisoners	276.5287780761719
Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were doomed	118.32997131347656
The truth is I m very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porthos	147.33096313476562
Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried DArtagnan	142.24032592773438
Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly then	54.66238784790039
It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years agoyou Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugirard	98.24382781982422
Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he is	261.48382568359375
In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed DArtagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop	69.54671478271484
It was Mordaunt	32.373878479003906
DArtagnan rushed out of the room	27.891830444335938
Porthos wanted to follow him	40.066444396972656
Stay said DArtagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door	180.22726440429688
When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw DArtagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms	36.14664077758789
Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there	323.8800048828125
Yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	27.244338989257812
Tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging	59.52146911621094
Four men prepared to do so	44.86659240722656
What is it said DArtagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance	45.268150329589844
What is the matter if you please	65.72295379638672
Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging	90.07715606689453
Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the subject	107.33818054199219
Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I like	27.360937118530273
Allow meallow me sir said DArtagnan to observe you are in error	26.41421890258789
The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken	78.76483154296875
You might have taken Lord Winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking them	57.44590377807617
Mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	123.1705093383789
DArtagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the door	80.49376678466797
At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	115.18254089355469
This movement was observed by Mordaunt	21.515087127685547
Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Cromwell	105.57307434082031
These words struck DArtagnan like a thunderbolt	54.46560287475586
The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword	83.15962982177734
As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at DArtagnan	108.01262664794922
This look of Porthoss made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning	38.408973693847656
Violence he said to himself would spoil all DArtagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is	71.13359832763672
Ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that Monsieur Mordaunt What are you sent by General Oliver Cromwell the most illustrious captain of the age	163.58885192871094
I have this instant left him replied Mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold	44.97626876831055
Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your wishes	219.1710662841797
They are yours take them	31.80560874938965
Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at DArtagnan with openmouthed astonishment	26.8380126953125
Then DArtagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	69.0863265991211
Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him	22.627941131591797
But pardon said DArtagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing	132.25221252441406
Mordaunt stopped short	25.372283935546875
He has given you some little writing for methe least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name	107.67821502685547
Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen	262.58123779296875
Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance	128.89540100097656
Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at DArtagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance	113.11909484863281
When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting it	764.8909912109375
I cried DArtagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman	315.91302490234375
And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued DArtagnan with his frank expression	106.4594497680664
Speak out sir said Mordaunt	27.59767723083496
Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money	17.961139678955078
I do not speak for him but for myself	81.65725708007812
Well sir What more	126.26648712158203
WellIIm not rich	138.963623046875
In Gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich and Henry IV	84.8209228515625
of glorious memory who was the king of the Gascons as His Majesty Philip IV	186.2772674560547
is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his pocket	90.43949890136719
Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the difficulty	43.16121292114258
Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of talent	164.28497314453125
Well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we French say	213.12408447265625
I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than banknotes	119.1759033203125
Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the GarterI said to myself my fortune is made	127.88896942138672
I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners	96.83985137939453
Mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of DArtagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said	75.49091339111328
I shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away	123.292724609375
No replied DArtagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in order	83.11785125732422
Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command here	41.39000701904297
Ah sir said DArtagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us	123.35323333740234
We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight menwe two only	250.7940216064453
For Heavens sake do nt be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself	25.474349975585938
Besides we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that General Oliver Cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand	171.75099182128906
Ask him then for the written order	96.1952133178711
What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt	45.42748260498047
Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what DArtagnan was aiming at we ask only for that	111.93570709228516
However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons DArtagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom	140.56729125976562
He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	87.63385772705078
He therefore mounted his horse and disappeared	27.007308959960938
Good thought DArtagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need	125.8831787109375
Then turning without the least change of countenance to Porthos he said looking him full in the face Friend Porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them	49.014530181884766
Very well I understand	607.1207275390625
Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business	244.5525360107422
Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	88.45735168457031
I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are	77.04927825927734
No it is not worth while	86.96361541748047
Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantelpiece	6.157480716705322
All right	182.99169921875
He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs	92.84610748291016
At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him	128.9581756591797
DArtagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went away	23.474607467651367
My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced	76.35142517089844
I am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter	567.1297607421875
As you say Mazarin is a knave	50.466041564941406
I have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	28.748046875
Your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is Porthoss purse too	39.130523681640625
He put it into his pocket	336.7764587402344
The two friends were perfectly stupefied	4.629002094268799
Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	35.707950592041016
I was blind Athos has made me see that s all come here	62.13574981689453
The two friends went near him	131.30789184570312
Do you see that street There are the horses	189.42718505859375
Go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right do nt be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal	70.8685073852539
That will be the signal when I call outJesus Seigneur	157.4210662841797
But give us your word that you will come too DArtagnan said Athos	370.9048156738281
I swear I will by Heaven	63.59267044067383
Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all	1643.2720947265625
See Aramis as I have told you DArtagnan is first amongst us all said Athos	41.2155876159668
Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from compliments	70.82401275634766
Do nt forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the selfsame air	60.11647415161133
The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of Babylon	100.11795043945312
DArtagnan called the sergeant	190.74310302734375
My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me	55.72700881958008
Guard the prisoners well I beg of you	10.172374725341797
The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and DArtagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	104.81015014648438
Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest	9.163881301879883
Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the window	31.14507293701172
They are coming then said Porthos	27.179994583129883
In a moment	28.72174644470215
You did nt forget my purse	78.83573150634766
No be easy	134.4580535888672
Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	215.95912170410156
Then DArtagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	53.886478424072266
There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	33.50687026977539
It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad	5.077752113342285
The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away	94.93053436279297
Help help cried DArtagnan stopmy horse has the staggers	70.7293472290039
In an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam	610.8856811523438
Help cried DArtagnan	61.0198860168457
What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur	21.001890182495117
No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed out	31.518657684326172
The coast owing to the Gascons stratagem was clear	34.89149856567383
The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	54.861995697021484
Stop stop cried DArtagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men	13.937499046325684
Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	101.75714874267578
But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	65.70809173583984
In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their masters	63.54684066772461
With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind DArtagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	5.237666606903076
They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country	1032.4625244140625
All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair	40.72809600830078
Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching	7.5731658935546875
It was Mordaunt with the order in his hand	97.46255493164062
The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	74.97601318359375
The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	21.53981590270996
Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps	135.40151977539062
Chapter LIX	245.67739868164062
Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appetites	300.4115905761719
The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham	130.7464599609375
At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	62.091590881347656
As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together	42.18798828125
The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sentinel	39.10835266113281
Come first of all said Athos to DArtagnan my friend that I may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us all	147.3205108642578
Athos is rightyou have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his hand	52.419883728027344
To what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind	2.000459671020508
Now said the Gascon that is all well I accept for Porthos and myself everythingthanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare	471.05975341796875
The two friends recalled by DArtagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their turn	70.04325866699219
And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign	231.25765991210938
What shall we do	64.82630157470703
What are we going to do ifaith It is not very difficult to say	48.81719207763672
Tell us then DArtagnan	47.13623809814453
We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to France	54.00628662109375
As for me I will give my last sou for it	50.282379150390625
Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread	64.31464385986328
What do you say to this Du Vallon	12.734029769897461
I said Porthos I am entirely of DArtagnans opinion this is a beastly country this England	50.71391677856445
You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of DArtagnan	78.03282928466797
Egad I do nt see what is to keep me here	37.83756637573242
A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis	42.50990295410156
Go then my friends said the former sighing	26.526193618774414
How go then exclaimed DArtagnan	97.61637115478516
Let us go you mean	39.90812301635742
No my friend said Athos you must leave us	24.059375762939453
Leave you cried DArtagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	273.2616271972656
Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together	140.0476531982422
Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is not	47.80770492553711
Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed DArtagnan looking in astonishment at Athos	48.978328704833984
No my friend replied Athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend King Charles we have but ill defended himit remains for us to save him	61.766761779785156
To save the king said DArtagnan looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos	105.02327728271484
Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	168.2225799560547
DArtagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen	39.31454086303711
You can not be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to London	67.87525177001953
This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littleColonel Harrison	60.024356842041016
His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to expect	16.051443099975586
A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis	35.00027084350586
And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued DArtagnan	98.18753051757812
And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Athos	66.28717041015625
The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him	182.12388610839844
Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned	30.80316925048828
What did he say asked Porthos	297.6026916503906
Princes must be knocked on the head	84.17858123779297
I remember it said Athos	50.30695343017578
And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king	24.202795028686523
On the contrary I am certain he will do so	68.29183197021484
But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened	101.38407897949219
Athos you are becoming mad	60.8961181640625
No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur dHerblay and myself to Madame Henrietta	76.02337646484375
Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband	58.09928512573242
We engaged our word our word included everything	97.47901153564453
It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised	39.97087860107422
It remains now for us to keep our word	98.21675109863281
Is that your opinion DHerblay	404.6822814941406
Yes said Aramis we have promised	83.2187728881836
Then continued Athos we have another reason it is thislisten In France at this moment everything is poor and paltry	72.67849731445312
We have a king ten years old who does nt yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs France as he would govern a great farmthat is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from Mazarins hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes	53.77028274536133
I have served them without enthusiasmGod knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on principle	81.81494903564453
Today I am engaged in a different affair	77.01427459716797
I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to it	150.01072692871094
If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand	159.0867919921875
So you know beforehand you must perish said DArtagnan	59.169189453125
We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you	45.74024200439453
What will you do in a foreign land an enemys country	106.06362915039062
I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the language	167.55284118652344
Ah if we had you my friends With you DArtagnan with you Porthosall four reunited for the first time for twenty yearswe would dare not only England but the three kingdoms put together	115.33477783203125
And did you promise the queen resumed DArtagnan petulantly to storm the Tower of London to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is Cromwell Do not exaggerate your duty	274.236083984375
In Heavens name my dear Athos do not make a useless sacrifice	134.425537109375
When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a madman	64.7177963256836
Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business	75.00093841552734
Nothing good replied Porthos	28.914030075073242
Come continued DArtagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice	114.84333038330078
Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with us	102.939697265625
Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevocable	37.53202438354492
Then you have some other motive unknown to us	35.50516128540039
Athos smiled and DArtagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and Aramis by nodding his head	62.80448913574219
Very well cried DArtagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die	142.89874267578125
Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather sooner	32.55894088745117
Pooh a little sooner or a little later it is nt worth quarreling over	77.39762878417969
If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened	77.83230590820312
Oh it will happen you may be sure said DArtagnan	7.287261962890625
So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection	51.10752868652344
I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very good	41.13620376586914
But your future career DArtagnanyour ambition Porthos	140.1135711669922
Our future our ambition replied DArtagnan with feverish volubility	90.55316162109375
Need we think of that since we are to save the king The king savedwe shall assemble our friends togetherwe will head the Puritansreconquer England we shall reenter Londonplace him securely on his throne	135.7642822265625
And he will make us dukes and peers said Porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect	14.916847229003906
Or he will forget us added DArtagnan	90.74620056152344
Oh said Porthos	39.80363464355469
Well that has happened friend Porthos	57.79189682006836
It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for Charles I	27.900636672973633
but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty years	304.7115478515625
Well in spite of that DArtagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her	77.16171264648438
No indeed said DArtagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that remembrance	22.989913940429688
You see then DArtagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never is	52.4093132019043
Athos said DArtagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to Heaven	77.17375183105469
So then said Athos offering his hand to DArtagnan	8.86348819732666
Tis settled replied DArtagnan	50.523536682128906
I find England a charming country and I staybut on one condition only	27.984066009521484
What is it	99.71469116210938
That I am not forced to learn English	63.70214080810547
Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears usI believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France again	29.400836944580078
So be it said DArtagnan but II confess I have a contrary conviction	99.33489227294922
Our good DArtagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye	71.32284545898438
But in the meantime saves the country added Athos	208.8335418701172
Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined	334.4350891113281
Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer	47.4681396484375
What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porthos	60.34994888305664
My plan	56.765541076660156
Yes have you a plan	8.166765213012695
No I am hungry that is all	87.3240966796875
Pardieu if that is all I am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses	134.67076110839844
Ah exclaimed Aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as Athos do you remember when we were at Parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate	64.03278350830078
And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said Porthos smacking his lips	74.9453125
But suggested DArtagnan have we not our friend Mousqueton who managed for us so well at Chantilly Porthos	73.04733276367188
Yes said Porthos we have Mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably	85.36882781982422
Here Mouston cried Porthos	47.75395584106445
Mouston appeared with a most piteous face	70.330078125
What is the matter my dear M	84.41899871826172
Mouston asked DArtagnan	45.72978591918945
Are you ill	106.70609283447266
Sir I am very hungry replied Mouston	1330.7730712890625
Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good M	176.28204345703125
Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the hotel	63.04945755004883
At the hotel of said Porthos by my faithnor do I remember it either	23.50147819519043
It does not matter and a few of those bottles of old Burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain	31.885740280151367
Alas sir said Mousqueton I much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and I think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest	84.6221694946289
How is there a house in the neighborhood asked DArtagnan	204.8078155517578
Yes sir replied Mousqueton	21.211063385009766
Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	122.66854858398438
What is your opinion gentlemen and does not M	204.1230010986328
Moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense	150.2052764892578
Oh said Aramis suppose the master is a Puritan	90.07695007324219
So much the better mordioux replied DArtagnan if he is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens	193.505615234375
But if he should be a cavalier said Porthos	129.0355987548828
In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls	147.2144012451172
You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of everything	34.339439392089844
What would you have said DArtagnan	184.2597198486328
I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky	49.84945297241211
It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain	54.894859313964844
Come come said DArtagnan more reason why we should start on our journey	294.24310302734375
Halloo Grimaud	59.46787643432617
Grimaud appeared	149.19287109375
Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gascon	31.456331253051758
Nothing replied Grimaud	98.99122619628906
Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued us	66.45874786376953
Oh if we had been in their place	56.451988220214844
Yes they are wrong said DArtagnan	74.82340240478516
I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little desert	48.230106353759766
It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style	53.003475189208984
I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son has nt his mothers energy	414.3460388183594
What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	42.68966293334961
We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before then	88.7898941040039
Meanwhile let us dine suggested Porthos	51.21537399291992
Ifaith yes said Athos for I am hungry	114.0131607055664
Look out for the black fowls cried Aramis	64.7792739868164
And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	71.98681640625
Chapter LX	34.72541046142578
Respect to Fallen Majesty	42.243690490722656
As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them	57.13442611694336
Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there	95.17406463623047
Egad cried DArtagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here	55.4295768737793
The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten everything	103.75032806396484
Bah said DArtagnan they will have left a chicken at least	77.2557373046875
He dismounted and knocked on the door	59.63519287109375
There was no response	66.45256042480469
He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	102.80430603027344
Well cried Porthos	1018.9461059570312
I can see nobody said DArtagnan	23.943782806396484
At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	20.568382263183594
DArtagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object	119.46488189697266
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	38.01139831542969
It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so	34.1527214050293
Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	39.302635192871094
Well inquired DArtagnan	77.30253601074219
Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still warm	25.216127395629883
But no his heart is beating	2.000459671020508
Ho there my friend	200.88746643066406
The wounded man heaved a sigh	226.35214233398438
DArtagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	147.01719665527344
The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	147.54566955566406
The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously	118.47761535644531
Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash	52.24897766113281
Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him	70.59834289550781
You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened	46.43849563598633
The king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner	29.41142463684082
You have seen him asked Aramis in the same language	67.61991119384766
The man made no reply	57.5758056640625
Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty	515.2704467773438
Is what you tell me true asked the wounded man	57.31962966918945
On our honor as gentlemen	71.33451080322266
Then I may tell you all	60.501075744628906
I am brother to Parry his majestys lackey	22.212158203125
Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings tent	79.75215911865234
We know him said Athos he never left the king	48.36869812011719
Yes that is he	149.7091064453125
Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	187.58041381835938
They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	433.133056640625
Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle	96.7613754272461
He knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	187.96713256835938
He made a sign which I understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard	166.40391540527344
I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	185.34677124023438
Alas he would not	292.1015930175781
But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	1955.6087646484375
I went on first fortunately	153.62716674804688
The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow	308.697021484375
I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible	66.94355773925781
When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same place	153.339111328125
I dragged myself as far as the yard	138.6014404296875
The king and his escort were no longer there	488.89874267578125
I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted again	84.15390014648438
And now how are you feeling	103.68988800048828
Very ill replied the wounded man	86.67135620117188
Can we do anything for you asked Athos	289.62506103515625
Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better there	56.381507873535156
Have you any one to depend on for assistance	132.86476135253906
My wife is at Durham and may return at any moment	45.19241714477539
But youis there nothing that you want	29.6995849609375
We came here with the intention of asking for something to eat	53.65843200683594
Alas they have taken everything there is nt a morsel of bread in the house	69.56697845458984
You hear DArtagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner	26.52155876159668
It is all one to me now said DArtagnan I am no longer hungry	87.12969207763672
Faith neither am I said Porthos	152.23741149902344
They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound	12.64663314819336
In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon	30.852067947387695
In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together	43.748565673828125
Now said Aramis we know how the matter stands	144.59703063964844
The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh	77.75700378417969
Athos did not reply he reflected	68.2879867553711
Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	43.091087341308594
What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal	56.052513122558594
What do you think DArtagnan asked Athos	170.97544860839844
Do you agree with Aramis	4.039363384246826
Not at all said DArtagnan I am precisely of the contrary opinion	105.08534240722656
What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in dismay	93.46434020996094
No I would join the escort	123.77404022216797
Athoss eyes shone with joy	12.089634895324707
Join the escort cried Aramis	93.20110321044922
Let DArtagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to give	242.2700958251953
Clearly said DArtagnan we must go where they will not look for us	355.5052185058594
Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must go	120.02352905273438
Good my friend good said Athos	140.598388671875
It is excellent advice	11.762993812561035
I was about to give it when you anticipated me	152.14886474609375
That then is your opinion asked Aramis	62.730743408203125
They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the king	75.89167785644531
Once in London we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the way	73.70072174072266
Yes said Aramis I understand	74.61906433105469
I however do not understand said Porthos	19.431697845458984
But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of DArtagnan and of Athos it must be the best	50.61129379272461
But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison	75.11793518066406
Egad cried DArtagnan he s just the man I count upon	99.3574447631836
Colonel Harrison is one of our friends	308.577392578125
We have met him twice at General Cromwells	168.8896026611328
He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as brothers	42.59880065917969
Besides is he not a butchers son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns	112.54728698730469
That will insure his confidence	49.70985794067383
Athos smiled	90.18683624267578
You are the best companion that I know DArtagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear son	115.44657897949219
This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to DArtagnan in his more expansive moods	63.74136734008789
At this moment Grimaud came in	226.59124755859375
He had stanched the wound and the man was better	756.1069946289062
The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother	63.84780502319336
Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright	86.75198364257812
However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death	114.22303771972656
Be easy said DArtagnan he will know all before night	97.98968505859375
The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	105.38632202148438
My dear friends said DArtagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners	473.3049621582031
It was not long before they joined the escort	143.13107299804688
The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks	9.04849624633789
DArtagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could	156.45489501953125
It turned out as DArtagnan had foreseen	36.54222869873047
The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion	27.228403091430664
They halted for the king to dine	319.17755126953125
This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape	103.79199981689453
In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers	395.3700256347656
Will you dine with me asked Harrison of DArtagnan	117.08011627197266
Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I can not leave	208.95326232910156
Let us manage it better	70.46095275878906
Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours	39.60658645629883
Good answered Harrison	162.5568389892578
The matter was arranged as DArtagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	389.6654968261719
The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the king	131.86041259765625
The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	183.58705139160156
They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody	23.162151336669922
The officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	32.81114196777344
Ifaith colonel said DArtagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast	104.38490295410156
My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry	111.55653381347656
And I am so still said Porthos bowing to Harrison	103.76546478271484
And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you	92.06754302978516
In a very simple manner colonel said DArtagnan	44.284271240234375
I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	77.32315063476562
You can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathedAh colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow	199.9204864501953
Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table	119.39010620117188
When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time	58.409339904785156
Ah it was this gentleman said DArtagnan bowing to the officer	99.69657897949219
I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my compliments	93.2233657836914
I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in Paris	52.397457122802734
Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man	80.75157165527344
Nearly I thought I had quite said Groslow	64.09981536865234
It was a very near thing but he is not dead	197.05831909179688
As he said this DArtagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him	26.956951141357422
The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	91.85465240478516
Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded better	62.84241485595703
If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish him	60.9367561340332
And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week	37.03587341308594
And DArtagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	45.13357925415039
Parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	1960.3612060546875
I ve a great desire to drink the kings health said Athos	346.7859191894531
Let me propose it then said DArtagnan	3443.1240234375
Do said Aramis	106.57124328613281
Porthos looked at DArtagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions Gascon sharpness continually supplied him	68.65333557128906
DArtagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose	64.86412048339844
Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast	20.568382263183594
Heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and farther	147.14736938476562
And as DArtagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself	5925.82177734375
He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	45.502342224121094
The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude	83.63712310791016
Come gentlemen cried Harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off	7.406889915466309
Where do we sleep colonel	50.99162292480469
At Thirsk replied Harrison	74.16102600097656
Parry said the king rising too my horse I desire to go to Thirsk	240.1006317138672
Egad said DArtagnan to Athos your king has thoroughly taken me and I am quite at his service	52.811622619628906
If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach London	174.5854949951172
How so	16.955280303955078
Because before then we shall have carried him off	84.70262145996094
Well this time Athos said DArtagnan upon my word you are mad	31.048988342285156
Have you some plan in your head then asked Aramis	43.50527572631836
Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan	171.4983673095703
I have none said Athos but DArtagnan will discover one	102.43535614013672
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded	47.1783447265625
Chapter LXI	107.38082122802734
DArtagnan hits on a Plan	85.55171203613281
As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk	82.71713256835938
The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king	241.7479248046875
They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	51.5228385925293
The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway	77.03968811035156
DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity	58.9403076171875
Porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as usual	54.62512969970703
He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one another	171.63719177246094
Next morning DArtagnan was the first to rise	102.34239196777344
He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos snoring	87.905517578125
At eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that DArtagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow	59.384090423583984
Groslow whom DArtagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile	176.6847381591797
Really sir DArtagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue	92.62907409667969
My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day	13.805916786193848
As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation	4.151792049407959
They are hot royalists said Groslow	100.01702880859375
The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope you re preparing a pretty trial	58.82508087158203
Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London for	117.80554962158203
And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume	640.4451293945312
I should think not indeed	121.38164520263672
You see he has a truly royal escort	125.19483184814453
Ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night	79.65547180175781
We redouble our precautions	99.22572326660156
And what method of surveillance do you employ	136.3284149169922
Eight men remain constantly in his room	54.73458480834961
The deuce he is well guarded then	11.854284286499023
But besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside	517.1428833007812
Oh no Just think	51.47871017456055
What would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men	3.892085552215576
Two menhow do you mean	73.7878646850586
Yes the king and his lackey	38.34428405761719
Oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him	19.97018814086914
Yes Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented	55.662925720214844
Under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance	99.16262817382812
Really captain said DArtagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak French	167.30551147460938
You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there	77.35829162597656
My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in London	386.5881042480469
Were you pleased with Paris sir	9.04849624633789
Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queens favorite	73.52938842773438
Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible	205.344970703125
But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell	828.001220703125
That is to say I am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms	16.671798706054688
So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the proposition	30.290224075317383
Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt	148.18850708007812
On his right and left sir	34.38108825683594
Ah there s another brave and excellent young man	508.9869079589844
Do you know him asked the officer	39.01166915893555
Yes very well	94.18009948730469
Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with him	110.04345703125
It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne	141.89808654785156
What would you have I was like you and had a king in keeping	56.66947555541992
Aha said Groslow what king	74.83525085449219
Our own to be sure the little oneLouis XIV	64.49925231933594
And how long had you to take care of him	70.8175277709961
Three nights and by my troth I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure	290.5030517578125
How do you mean	29.27479362487793
I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing	407.40142822265625
Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon companions	231.55160522460938
And do nt you play too when you are on guard	120.02387237548828
Never said the Englishman	300.248046875
In that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy	218.8140411376953
The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	322.4224548339844
Its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night	154.61997985839844
Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream	78.13562774658203
You do nt like playing then	82.34960174560547
On the contrary I do	95.12955474853516
Lansquenet for instance	184.08961486816406
Devoted to it	56.88107681274414
I used to play almost every night in France	178.73324584960938
And since your return to England	32.12405014038086
I have not handled a card or dicebox	78.598876953125
I sincerely pity you said DArtagnan with an air of profound compassion	69.66932678222656
Look here said the Englishman	14.606722831726074
Tomorrow I am on guard	28.48423194885254
In Stuarts room	18.64617156982422
Yes come and pass the night with me	72.07636260986328
Impossible why so	207.89869689941406
I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night	37.619686126708984
Sometimes we do nt go to bed at all	93.16008758544922
Well what of that	192.59759521484375
Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with him	131.68887329101562
Does he play well	42.59724426269531
I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down	85.48295593261719
Bring him with you then	58.736759185791016
But how about our prisoners	43.09393310546875
Let your servants guard them	325.1311950683594
Yes and give them a chance of escaping said DArtagnan	62.446651458740234
Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble family	30.36457061767578
We have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in France	89.18830108642578
We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires	85.7467269897461
It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play	176.0303955078125
Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	18.925050735473633
We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches	60.595916748046875
Ah ah said Groslow	44.65776062011719
You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost	165.37094116210938
Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all	111.6037826538086
I can understand that said DArtagnan	64.21098327636719
But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous	48.95009994506836
In what respect	76.46116638183594
Are they capable of attempting violence	197.9132843017578
DArtagnan burst out laughing at the idea	167.68472290039062
Jesus Dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of Malta as timid as a young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors	46.70664978027344
Well then said Groslow bring them with you	33.52107620239258
But really said DArtagnan	89.78804016113281
I have eight men on guard you know	51.04092025756836
Four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	167.39280700683594
Ill manage it somehow you will see	459.4281005859375
But said DArtagnan now I think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight	133.6297607421875
Nothing at all said Groslow	1197.2388916015625
Just so	56.36470413208008
Come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit	185.304443359375
Capital This evening with you tomorrow at Stuarts the next day with me	114.83468627929688
You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said DArtagnan	20.111351013183594
Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like you	129.1151885986328
And Monsieur du Vallon added the other	97.05995178222656
You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two doors	123.53470611572266
They employ him because they are afraid of him	17.36631965637207
Ah there he is calling me now	431.3777770996094
You ll excuse me I know	373.07525634765625
They exchanged bows and DArtagnan returned to his companions	100.3056411743164
What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porthos	86.5621566772461
My dear fellow do nt speak like that of Monsieur Groslow	41.900146484375
He s one of my most intimate friends	85.31640625
One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers	255.43179321289062
Hush my dear Porthos	34.44391632080078
Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and stupid	449.8020324707031
Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew DArtagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	24.828170776367188
But continued DArtagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	117.45985412597656
He is coming to play with us this evening	85.326416015625
Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the news	42.576438903808594
Is he rich	3.923752546310425
He s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London	250.2733917236328
And knows lansquenet	39.908199310302734
Adores it	57.12388229370117
His mania	82.16971588134766
Revels in it	37.11579132080078
Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening	846.7677612304688
The more so as it will be the prelude to a better	138.8828125
How so	86.56867218017578
We invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return tomorrow	22.97809410095215
But wait	294.6866760253906
Tonight we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy it	1724.6934814453125
It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partakeAthos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and wo nt mix with fellows like us	472.6667175292969
Do you understand	133.341552734375
That s no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at all	333.90081787109375
Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the fathers side from the Prophets and on the mothers from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and riddles	29.240781784057617
Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at present	95.04485321044922
Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well done	108.4593734741211
And you Aramis are you of that opinion	82.2909927368164
Entirely so my dear DArtagnan	161.37388610839844
Very good said DArtagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will believe	166.35289001464844
The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incredulous	401.3165283203125
DArtagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	420.81243896484375
At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon	306.24334716796875
Blaisois went with him	90.93870544433594
In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	71.17434692382812
It was there a lodging was prepared for them	70.80608367919922
At the hour agreed upon Groslow came	373.1392822265625
DArtagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	192.41912841796875
Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as himself	151.1774139404297
Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality	689.8490600585938
In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	63.62688064575195
Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role	130.9529266357422
At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration	237.82298278808594
Furthermore DArtagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Groslow	57.11421585083008
Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be	742.2232666015625
As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from DArtagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment	226.9058837890625
The next day was spent as usual	150.57022094726562
DArtagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends	34.329689025878906
To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto Athos and Aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety	62.67491912841797
What is he contriving asked Aramis	53.122276306152344
Wait said Athos	81.77411651611328
Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	131.55206298828125
Arrived at Ryston DArtagnan assembled his friends	126.12116241455078
His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day	114.87926483154297
Athos pinched Aramiss hand	61.450401306152344
The moment is at hand he said	80.5136947631836
Yes returned DArtagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the king	172.63916015625
DArtagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me up	64.50032806396484
You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me thus	63.070655822753906
Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life I have told you and I repeat it that tonight we rescue Charles I	145.71327209472656
You left it to me to discover the means and I have done so	193.45994567871094
Porthos looked at DArtagnan with an expression of profound admiration	84.6304702758789
Aramis smiled as one who hopes	112.92621612548828
Athos was pale and trembled in every limb	153.85516357421875
Speak said Athos	123.55856323242188
We are invited replied DArtagnan to pass the night with M	19.442861557006836
But do you know where	81.8160400390625
In the kings room	59.125274658203125
The kings room cried Athos	374.63006591796875
Yes gentlemen in the kings room	45.39105224609375
Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company	41.588775634765625
All four of us asked Athos	371.1675720214844
Pardieu certainly all four we could nt leave our prisoners could we	89.35034942626953
Ah ah said Aramis	79.54191589355469
Tell us about it said Athos palpitating	81.41647338867188
We are going then we two with our swords you with daggers	206.30226135253906
We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain	68.61125183105469
Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that	166.74639892578125
I say it is easy enough answered Porthos	69.4553451538086
We dress the king in Groslows clothes	66.79878997802734
Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street	265.1021728515625
We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant	93.35071563720703
Athos placed his two hands on DArtagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile	489.6966552734375
I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	49.36707305908203
Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you could nt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain	61.498504638671875
I repeat it DArtagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear son	2.000459671020508
And to think that I could nt find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so simple	31.055835723876953
But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh	60.39707565307617
Athos shuddered and turned pale	76.5950927734375
Mordioux answered DArtagnan I believe we must	83.84480285644531
I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory way	126.75445556640625
Let us see said Aramis how are we to act	104.80081176757812
I have arranged two plans	255.99964904785156
Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you	112.96234893798828
We on our side do the same	241.2629852294922
That will be four killed	224.78759765625
We shall then be matched four against the remaining five	46.24188232421875
If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them	10.16530990600586
If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one	95.66878509521484
It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time	27.036170959472656
But if you yourselves should be struck said Athos	34.64518737792969
Impossible said DArtagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward	157.8072967529297
Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry	185.0693817138672
Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting	37.44129943847656
Horrible horrible exclaimed Athos	72.8211441040039
Nonsense said DArtagnan you would do as much Mr	23.169450759887695
Humanity in a battle	94.615234375
But if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am ill	81.57405090332031
No you are right said Athos	436.6396484375
At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for them	6.462138652801514
Where asked DArtagnan	345.1905822753906
In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Puritan	61.61797332763672
Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming	131.5835418701172
The Puritan then went out	63.42048263549805
The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged	177.5066375732422
It was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour	154.2431640625
DArtagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuarts prison	113.4320068359375
The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms	163.11239624023438
Ods bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you up	36.158809661865234
DArtagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear	95.98091888427734
The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a little	166.48605346679688
And why	107.96036529541016
DArtagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis	61.726016998291016
Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No matter	55.99644088745117
On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see him	82.789306640625
Are we to pass the night in the kings room asked DArtagnan	56.501644134521484
No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing	266.2611083984375
Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devils game tonight	44.058692932128906
DArtagnan rattled the gold in his pockets	51.89352035522461
Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the room	141.7652587890625
I will show you the way and he went in first	86.30615997314453
DArtagnan turned to look at his friends	275.68157958984375
Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow	216.61083984375
The eight guards were at their posts	182.29061889648438
Four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	187.3188018798828
Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor	159.15985107421875
Charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which Parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the Bible	179.52076721191406
A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm	78.09000396728516
From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile	135.75424194335938
Go on my good Parry I am listening	127.87366485595703
Groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to DArtagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved	152.30398559570312
Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished general	137.21432495117188
And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard	157.61109924316406
No to be sure replied DArtagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him	176.99192810058594
Groslows face brightened	355.4768981933594
It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of DArtagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself	60.14962387084961
Parry too started and stopped reading	80.19563293457031
What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are tired	89.31460571289062
Parry resumed his reading	63.55717086791992
On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and dice	113.10367584228516
Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your places	70.80638122558594
I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur dArtagnan opposite to me	197.05174255371094
Athos turned red with rage	64.18331146240234
DArtagnan frowned at him	128.38455200195312
That s it said DArtagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Groslow	25.25395965576172
You Chevalier dHerblay to his left	258.91650390625
Du Vallon next me	157.68942260742188
You ll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow	74.3695297241211
By this arrangement DArtagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis	48.316139221191406
At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dHerblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene	45.145408630371094
At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah	102.52835083007812
God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto you	59.757049560546875
The four friends exchanged glances	80.46786499023438
The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive	64.61114501953125
DArtagnans eyes sparkled with joy	24.965335845947266
You asked me just now if I was in funds said DArtagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table	30.435272216796875
Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it	186.073974609375
Not without my defending it said Groslow	94.18126678466797
So much the better said DArtagnan	186.37181091308594
Fight my dear captain fight	35.3719596862793
You know or you do nt know that that is what we ask of you	71.689697265625
Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises	201.32350158691406
Charles had heard and understood it all	204.90931701660156
A slight color mounted to his cheeks	94.0945053100586
The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him	95.263916015625
Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	140.75335693359375
The game began	58.31218719482422
The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor	69.04222869873047
Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned DArtagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	51.89307403564453
Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly	36.605613708496094
But DArtagnan remained impassible	104.12039947509766
It struck ten	45.26738357543945
They heard the guard going its rounds	17.053674697875977
How many rounds do they make a night asked DArtagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket	122.72395324707031
Five answered Groslow one every two hours	129.90243530273438
DArtagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive	39.945831298828125
Meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kings room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of DArtagnan and Porthos	116.04656982421875
Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	59.907379150390625
The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	31.025203704833984
Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	36.56172561645508
With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter	70.4111099243164
Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard	37.44059371948242
Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	61.707122802734375
DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God	599.5801391601562
DArtagnan saw that the moment was come	48.46187210083008
He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action	134.11752319335938
He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard	2.000459671020508
Hang it cried DArtagnan another twenty pistoles lost	1702.572509765625
Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortunes way	83.5966567993164
This ca nt last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	126.99639129638672
One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the last	31.163293838500977
Done for twenty replied Groslow	479.506103515625
And he turned up two cards as usual a king for DArtagnan and an ace for himself	189.0969696044922
A king said DArtagnan its a good omen Master Groslowlook out for the king	235.0054168701172
And in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the Gascons voice which made his partner start	562.1431884765625
Groslow began turning the cards one after another	100.69097900390625
If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost	43.87266540527344
He turned up a king	406.74261474609375
At last cried DArtagnan	121.69779205322266
At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up	290.7256164550781
Porthos drew back a step	103.10543823242188
Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak	56.040409088134766
Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	47.48283004760742
Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice	410.7438049316406
But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room followed by his companion	161.5609130859375
Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or night	444.9429931640625
Prepare yourself then to start at once	34.931636810302734
And by whom is this order given asked the king	80.9244155883789
By General Oliver Cromwell	383.0899658203125
And here is Mr	45.45448303222656
Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution	45.753822326660156
Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances	71.61750030517578
DArtagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket	27.54192352294922
Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him	125.1589584350586
At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight	140.93763732910156
I m afraid we are prisoners whispered DArtagnan to his friend	157.38308715820312
Not yet replied Porthos	49.151283264160156
Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are betrayed	206.81198120117188
These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	69.21825408935547
Arrest them	49.415340423583984
Ah my young man said DArtagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	189.02206420898438
Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him	80.45328521728516
The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	38.92766571044922
Athos and Aramis followed him	227.08468627929688
Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street	553.4635620117188
Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them	77.18154907226562
Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound	91.63621520996094
The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	45.35222625732422
Forward cried DArtagnan and spur for your dear lives	172.0511474609375
They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward Scotland	70.7494888305664
A few hundred yards beyond the town DArtagnan drew rein	71.61578369140625
Halt he cried this time we shall be pursued	5289.15576171875
We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction	131.67800903320312
There was a stream close by and a bridge across it	27.68235206604004
DArtagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	98.32471466064453
The others followed	104.51475524902344
Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen	92.18461608886719
A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	206.80052185058594
Chapter LXII	32.9299201965332
As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance DArtagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward London	41.71227264404297
This time said DArtagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach France	51.83510971069336
What do you say Athos to that proposition Is nt it reasonable	116.71183776855469
Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and generous	22.924997329711914
You said Let us die here I recall to you that word	109.21796417236328
Oh said Porthos death is nothing it is nt death that can disquiet us since we do nt know what it is	362.8176574707031
What troubles me is the idea of defeat	242.00015258789062
As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we ca nt fail to be beaten	159.50729370117188
We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Athos	39.49324417114258
Whatever happens let us not leave England before the crisis	110.41143035888672
Do nt you agree with me Aramis	76.57119750976562
Entirely my dear count	86.04613494873047
Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt again	42.76011276245117
It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least	109.87016296386719
Ah that s another thing said DArtagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in question	116.14893341064453
Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	84.01769256591797
Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin	91.24754333496094
I think I know what you want replied Athos	101.4593734741211
De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	85.59920501708984
What do you say to it Aramis	222.5680694580078
Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to it	210.2013397216797
We will invoke the remembrance of that poor De Winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and I think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed	36.777828216552734
You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable importance	160.15365600585938
What is that	260.5380554199219
The precaution of changing our clothes	43.31574630737305
Changing our clothes exclaimed Porthos	124.4187240600586
I do nt see why we are very comfortable in those we wear	109.66901397705078
To prevent recognition said DArtagnan	263.6901550292969
Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first sight	295.46502685546875
Now I do nt set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the Indies	97.86809539794922
I shall buy a chestnutcolored suit	77.34110260009766
I ve remarked that your Puritans revel in that color	194.7928009033203
But can you find your man said Aramis to Athos	182.7090301513672
Oh to be sure yes	32.47951889038086
He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall Street	66.46599578857422
Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes shut	226.81077575683594
I wish we were already there said DArtagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our horses	160.56121826171875
Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go	256.46099853515625
The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the morning	84.50091552734375
They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the king	74.82247161865234
That reply led to several questions about the kings capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely	83.54528045654297
The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan congratulations	76.30276489257812
Athos was right	43.863983154296875
He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company	162.1656494140625
Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king	78.30790710449219
The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	120.52127838134766
The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe	266.31201171875
Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen	508.18011474609375
Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military cut	199.27682495117188
Porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen breeches	136.1904754638672
DArtagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	51.638832092285156
Now said DArtagnan for the actual man	65.15144348144531
We must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	1878.121337890625
As we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the Puritan	117.69017028808594
This as you know is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Cavalier	64.6954345703125
After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of barber	91.36618041992188
We look hideous said Athos	331.5168151855469
And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aramis	82.36212921142578
My head feels actually cold said Porthos	161.43507385253906
As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said DArtagnan	75.80191802978516
Now said Athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings entrance	70.02326202392578
They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings arrival	140.5148162841797
A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching	181.23745727539062
DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the other	51.32032012939453
The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the exking Charles I	414.00360107421875
to the bar publicly cried	174.62820434570312
Parliament indeed cried Athos	471.05975341796875
Parliament can never have passed such an act as that	76.19580078125
At this moment the landlord came in	50.14696502685547
Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in English	108.26358795166016
Yes my lord the pure parliament	47.6563720703125
What do you mean by the pure parliament Are there then two parliaments	66.77082824707031
My friend DArtagnan interrupted as I do nt understand English and we all understand Spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance	326.1798400878906
Ah excellent said Aramis	155.0669708251953
As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table	118.92952728271484
You were asking then said the host in Spanish	30.73638916015625
I asked said Athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure	122.50989532470703
Why how extraordinary said Porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment I understand English then I understand what you say	108.44070434570312
That is because we are talking Spanish my dear friend said Athos	69.91099548339844
Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language more	101.56446075439453
When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has weeded	603.4989624023438
Ah really said DArtagnan these people are very ingenious	48.66352844238281
When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadjutor	62.69527816772461
One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wo nt be any parliament at all	46.11897277832031
And who is this Colonel Bridge asked Aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament	99.07986450195312
Colonel Bridge replied the Spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it	49.96320343017578
Now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon	31.670251846313477
He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house	137.4268035888672
Neat remarked DArtagnan	54.00318145751953
And all these one hundred and ninetyone were Royalists asked Athos	90.77022552490234
Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king	63.377559661865234
To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority	98.30924987792969
And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal	102.81490325927734
He will be forced to do so smiled the Spaniard	75.2470703125
Now Athos said DArtagnan do you begin to believe that its a ruined cause and that what with your Harrisons Joyces Bridges and Cromwells we shall never get the upper hand	298.3873291015625
The king will be delivered at the tribunal said Athos the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work	172.45033264160156
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders	86.27074432373047
But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment	118.02140045166016
DArtagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	108.95901489257812
We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I presume	690.8468627929688
You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin tomorrow	167.79078674316406
So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken	147.16897583007812
Of course said DArtagnan they began the day he was sold	129.84742736816406
And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures	56.844093322753906
And you know added DArtagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mordaunt	158.13339233398438
And I too exclaimed Porthos	2.000459671020508
And I too added Aramis	297.402099609375
Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	233.4303436279297
Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog	83.0140380859375
Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from beer	352.70904541015625
Chapter LXIII	465.3315734863281
The Trial	197.7036895751953
The next morning King Charles I	55.86083221435547
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	38.53585433959961
All London was crowding to the doors of the house	134.77914428710938
The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination	108.69318389892578
When they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of Porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the armchair prepared for the royal prisoner	403.064208984375
Toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	95.26327514648438
The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	456.8409729003906
Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it	124.0386734008789
Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand	74.73918151855469
Parry who accompanied him stood behind him	462.2062072753906
DArtagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his own	108.24346160888672
This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened him	77.33118438720703
I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den	97.73704528808594
Set your mind at rest replied Athos	228.02980041503906
Aha continued DArtagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced	112.79975128173828
They had only halberds before now they have muskets	75.86910247802734
The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us	94.21123504638672
Thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said Porthos counting the reinforcements	70.83539581298828
Ah said Aramis but you forget the officer	51.2945442199707
DArtagnan grew pale with rage	54.56315612792969
He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	95.41020202636719
Do you think they have recognized us said DArtagnan	57.95830154418945
In that case I should beat a retreat	169.49993896484375
I do nt care to be shot in a box	102.17992401123047
No said Aramis he has not seen us	51.94749069213867
He sees no one but the king	22.216754913330078
Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us	660.1688232421875
Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property	91.71070861816406
True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king	108.99020385742188
Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make	83.72618103027344
The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	78.11688995361328
Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence	44.458919525146484
Out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	288.85162353515625
When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial	154.1145782470703
Colonel Fairfax repeated Bradshaw	156.9999237060547
Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here	235.818115234375
A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	88.85981750488281
It is a womans voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and pretty	50.22304916381836
And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her	150.4337921142578
By my soul said Aramis she is charming	110.7647933959961
Look DArtagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaws gaze she has not turned pale	64.9129409790039
It is Lady Fairfax herself said DArtagnan	166.90208435058594
Do nt you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwells	203.07875061035156
The roll call continued	106.56398010253906
These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la Fere	131.95167541503906
You do nt know them	554.5533447265625
Athos look at Mordaunts smile	89.29851531982422
Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with you	311.13836669921875
The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	191.56936645507812
The feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	9.631996154785156
Look at it Aramis	30.926536560058594
The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation	87.37340545654297
Athos turned pale	11.992366790771484
A second time he was disappointed in his expectation	40.79957962036133
Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance	19.265581130981445
I told you so Athos said DArtagnan shrugging his shoulders	81.50950622558594
Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege	114.80183410644531
Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty	62.20180130004883
Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	291.4565734863281
The fact is said DArtagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment	49.952816009521484
But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough	37.381107330322266
In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no wrong	143.31178283691406
As for me thought Porthos giving Mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation I would leap down from the bench reach Mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him I would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of France	85.873779296875
Meantime DArtagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	8.548848152160645
I must speak to him about it	54.46174240112305
As to Athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement	104.63188171386719
At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English people	33.77949905395508
At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind DArtagnan	139.90000915527344
You lie it cried	74.51602172851562
Ninetenths of the English people are horrified at what you say	259.2455139160156
This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser	52.8127555847168
King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	48.39326858520508
Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	144.9700469970703
His eyes glittered with delight	68.3079833984375
He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life	48.766807556152344
A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he cried	386.2608337402344
But with the rapidity of thought DArtagnan seized Athos by the waist and followed by Porthos with Aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	59.2997932434082
Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen	77.0950698852539
He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	196.2723846435547
Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned	54.38304901123047
The tumult was indescribable	49.41331100463867
More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	145.68402099609375
The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	136.6577911376953
The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited	46.357322692871094
Quiet was at length restored	119.13130187988281
What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the king	62.26340866088867
Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles began	13.59329605102539
Before questioning me he said reply to my question	45.019649505615234
I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses	39.62044906616211
Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government	39.419857025146484
But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king No	52.44175720214844
To answer you would be to forget it	116.59463500976562
I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me	62.06586837768555
To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my executioners	277.1487121582031
And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his armchair	49.93259811401367
Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead	103.7379150390625
Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be it	85.52222442626953
We will judge you in spite of your silence	66.55718231201172
You are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder	74.1458511352539
The evidence will support it	124.22268676757812
Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this	58.637550354003906
Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture	269.9620361328125
Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner	48.34014129638672
Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall	42.98982238769531
And why Parry	27.107873916625977
Do not look I implore you my king	31.476579666137695
But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him	137.99191284179688
It isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table	16.0720157623291
The sight is hideous	4.864943981170654
Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn me	116.37213134765625
Thank you Parry	11.323629379272461
When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	182.40704345703125
As he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said	45.86440658569336
Ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioners axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and I strike you now waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return the blow	172.3917236328125
And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on	26.516969680786133
When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks	109.893798828125
How many people thought he and not one true friend	71.10884094238281
And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said	143.8888702392578
Respect to fallen majesty	129.1552734375
The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	164.30125427246094
It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage	106.95545196533203
But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of swordhilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow	56.173213958740234
Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault	172.92669677734375
He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Nazareth	248.54052734375
Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	752.0324096679688
The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Athos	246.7738800048828
Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father	39.367401123046875
The king was not mistaken	122.37648010253906
Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king	20.850244522094727
When the soldier saluted Charles Athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his pocket	58.00093460083008
But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his dagger	33626.15625
But DArtagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait	25.178293228149414
Athos stopped	108.46676635742188
DArtagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others	24.428348541259766
The man took his way toward the city	477.44769287109375
The four friends followed him	13.888949394226074
The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	63.293025970458984
Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	43.193111419677734
I do nt know English Athos said DArtagnan but you know it and will interpret for me	193.92784118652344
Then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and DArtagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to Athos	230.65733337402344
Say this to him in English You are a coward	5.747010707855225
You have insulted a defenseless man	91.91108703613281
You have befouled the face of your king	131.572265625
You must die	39.588096618652344
Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense	55.40127944946289
Aramis at this movement drew his sword	107.2445068359375
No cried DArtagnan no steel	118.64037322998047
Steel is for gentlemen	100.7838363647461
And seizing the butcher by the throat	44.003841400146484
Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow	76.78645324707031
Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	33.623497009277344
The man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe	84.36495208740234
His companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry out	28.666135787963867
Tell them this Athos resumed DArtagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the Lord	66.6761474609375
Athos repeated DArtagnans words	341.30633544921875
The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off	2.000459671020508
Justice is done said Porthos wiping his forehead	10217.6953125
And now said DArtagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the king	153.45870971679688
Chapter LXIV	488.80804443359375
The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been foreseen	139.05934143066406
Political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation	319.6158752441406
Such is the atrocious logic of revolutions	112.13358306884766
Although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief	59.959617614746094
DArtagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dnouement of the bloody tragedy	290.1148986816406
But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on circumstances	348.2036437988281
Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following daythe day appointed by the judges	132.4232177734375
The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner	79.63341522216797
The headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed	116.09013366699219
True they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue	154.53749084472656
DArtagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	493.6831359863281
Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	853.6548461914062
Aramis assumed that perilous charge	204.3695831298828
Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit him	58.217891693115234
Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwells permission	32.29342269897461
Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at Whitehall	104.3929214477539
Finally Athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving Englandin case either of failure or of success	62.02450942993164
The night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven oclock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission	187.1963653564453
The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually	18.33822250366211
Alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore	155.04966735839844
Parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep	50.2176399230957
Charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for Juxon then for martyrdom	43.67605972290039
At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams	196.24766540527344
In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever	43.31639862060547
He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards	77.4588394165039
He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real	97.49169921875
Charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	100.26031494140625
Alas he said to himself if I only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul	84.109130859375
But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune I have ruined by my misfortune	119.43309783935547
He will speak to me of God and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity	62.91557312011719
And he raised the medallion to his lips	126.99656677246094
It was a dull foggy night	61.59984588623047
A neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	117.9544448852539
The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	92.46456146240234
These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames	71.0967025756836
An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles	75.42474365234375
He buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment	65.45829010009766
He drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those generous Frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death	81.32878112792969
Then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold	86.94454956054688
That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth	269.9787902832031
Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	185.88731384277344
The guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	200.8998260498047
Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting moment	30.41899299621582
The bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the inglenook	44.87488555908203
Come Parry said the king cease your tears	370.03253173828125
If its Parry said the bishop I have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am come	144.3028564453125
At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England	302.6488037109375
The chevalier murmured Charles	45.459686279296875
Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majestys wishes	28.016408920288086
Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	181.63665771484375
You he said you how did you penetrate hither If they recognize you you are lost	96.27490997314453
Care not for me sire think only of yourself	24.859037399291992
You see your friends are wakeful	88.99623107910156
I know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much	478.6732177734375
Meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency	4.599449634552002
Charles shook his head	61.60615921020508
Do you know that I die tomorrow at ten oclock	49.38766098022461
Something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible	149.901611328125
The king looked at Aramis with astonishment	310.6097412109375
At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window	193.19371032714844
Do you hear said the king	72.04647064208984
I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain	33.069278717041016
I know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	110.34032440185547
Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window Well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	81.52925109863281
Some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt	308.2886962890625
Aramis shuddered in spite of himself	91.6562271118164
You see said the king that it is useless for you to resist	121.45477294921875
I am condemned leave me to my death	45.34833908081055
My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner	50.26587677001953
What do you mean asked the king	131.82647705078125
I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion	199.2393035888672
The scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after tomorrow	106.35503387451172
What then said the king	81.26372528076172
Tomorrow night we shall rescue you	124.45409393310547
How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy	218.0545196533203
Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed	107.96113586425781
How can it be repeated the king	37.263118743896484
I must know so that I may assist you if there is any chance	17.768808364868164
I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him off	13.533610343933105
He has said it and will do it	175.69688415527344
Tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that I may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not	312.89459228515625
DArtagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when Colonel Harrison made his untimely entrance	94.4330062866211
You are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me I should not have believed them	55.592018127441406
Now sire resumed Aramis listen to me	135.53097534179688
Do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret everything	277.1399841308594
Oh chevalier cried the king what can I say to you There is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude	121.63658905029297
If you succeed I do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as I am royalty I assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children	240.8666534423828
Chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh	10.91577434539795
Aramis stooped to kiss the kings hand but Charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart	73.49790954589844
At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door	979.15283203125
Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it	13.639118194580078
The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Cromwell	218.0104217529297
What do you want sir said the king	52.02772903442383
I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the stranger	603.6486206054688
And what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same religion	97.27975463867188
All men are brothers said the Puritan	13.96374225616455
One of my brothers is about to die and I come to prepare him	113.63751983642578
Bear with him whispered Aramis it is doubtless some spy	254.0454559326172
After my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man I shall hear you with pleasure sir	72.10169982910156
The man retired but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the king	31.64486312866211
Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions	376.2310791015625
Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave	111.31555938720703
I thank your majesty said Aramis but under these robes I have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger	87.98649597167969
Go then sir and God keep you	161.8341064453125
The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops palace	60.36097717285156
Juxon was waiting for him impatiently	219.1984405517578
Well said he on perceiving Aramis	12.226329803466797
Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him	49.28081512451172
May God protect you my son for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage	66.8550033569336
Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him	41.76053237915039
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak	68.31632232666016
He placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	96.6283187866211
The man came straight toward him	151.4674072265625
It was Porthos	74.79956817626953
My dear friend cried Aramis	68.15933227539062
You see we had each our mission said Porthos mine was to guard you and I am doing so	74.11312103271484
Have you seen the king	77.00924682617188
Yes and all goes well	70.77120971679688
We are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven	22.645626068115234
It was then striking halfpast ten by St	27.86764144897461
Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos entered	92.27722930908203
Alls well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow	137.63796997070312
It is waiting for us at Greenwich opposite the Isle of Dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights	29.333356857299805
Once on board we drop down the Thames and in two hours are on the open sea	160.3122100830078
In case I am killed the captains name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning	89.6744384765625
A handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal	50.87474060058594
Next moment DArtagnan entered	51.900997161865234
Empty your pockets said he I want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out	209.63938903808594
The sum was collected in a minute	143.42848205566406
DArtagnan ran out and returned directly after	233.41610717773438
There said he its done	137.4059600830078
Ough and not without a deal of trouble too	26.28813362121582
Has the executioner left London asked Athos	86.45486450195312
Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another	59.6207160949707
Where is he then	50.142051696777344
In the cellar	33.81702423095703
The cellarwhat cellar	10434.0966796875
Our landlords to be sure	57.006412506103516
Mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key	236.999755859375
Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it	2.000459671020508
Like everything else with money but it cost me dear	345.9970703125
How much asked Athos	326.50958251953125
Five hundred pounds	280.1981506347656
And where did you get so much money said Athos	87.68246459960938
Had you then that sum	170.31927490234375
The queens famous diamond answered DArtagnan with a sigh	99.16698455810547
Ah true said Aramis	37.36575698852539
I recognized it on your finger	54.118980407714844
You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porthos	26.042407989501953
Yes but it was fated that I should not keep it	74.05186462402344
So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him	69.58964538574219
And this one had his said DArtagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg	82.38180541992188
In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it	128.76177978515625
Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I heard	37.714622497558594
Probably said DArtagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom Lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to Whitehall with three of his friends	90.8923568725586
Heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea	40.987937927246094
And what on earth are you going to do with it asked Athos	73.21639251708984
Ca nt you guess my dear Athos You who speak English like John Bull himself are Master Tom Lowe we your three companions	46.680458068847656
Do you understand it now	195.34112548828125
Athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmens clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel Athos carrying a saw Porthos a vise Aramis an axe and DArtagnan a hammer and some nails	102.22787475585938
The letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected	365.29833984375
Chapter LXV	144.3267364501953
The Workmen	90.5007095336914
Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window	87.07154083251953
It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws	108.64115905761719
Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart	599.21630859375
He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king	35.72508239746094
The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to pass	54.51278305053711
Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	77.65902709960938
Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	105.69602966308594
Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	41.50042724609375
My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a sleep	99.45864868164062
One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone	143.75241088867188
The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement	109.75732421875
Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent English	92.57516479492188
Tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow night	74.64743041992188
These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	122.70393371582031
But Parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	27.322750091552734
Charles was impatiently awaiting his return	216.6909942626953
At the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing	80.35736083984375
The king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow	77.9731674194336
Parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy	50.69538497924805
Sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise	144.55050659179688
I No how would you have me know	114.94852447509766
Parry bent his head and whispered to the king It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends	140.0519256591797
Raising my scaffold cried the king astounded	343.7277526855469
Yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall	106.73484802246094
The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain	197.0074005126953
Parry was not wrong	284.30438232421875
It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	49.59352493286133
This hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below it	181.7115020751953
Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the kings room so as to form a kind of trapdoor	76.48661804199219
Through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich	56.383331298828125
Day gilded the tops of the houses	80.4195327758789
The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings room	100.32042694091797
He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to Bristol	38.380706787109375
DArtagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and Porthos to put on his red doublet	101.93892669677734
As for Aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the kings presence	57.867919921875
All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went on	17.876789093017578
Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king	110.93424987792969
Adieu then and be of good courage said Athos	71.39814758300781
Report to the king the condition of affairs	87.70153045654297
Say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then I can continue my work in safety	71.57276916503906
Try Aramis to keep near the king	77.87306213378906
Speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door	86.34078216552734
If there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation	127.85214233398438
If there are two let Parry kill one and you the other	144.0396270751953
If there are three let yourself be slain but save the king	107.5621337890625
Be easy said Aramis I will take two poniards and give one to Parry	94.62114715576172
Is that all	65.52433776855469
Yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	149.50180053710938
While you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	68.75436401367188
The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped	40.39836883544922
In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved	198.85679626464844
Everything shall be done as you say Athos	72.81846618652344
Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again	38.41547393798828
Athos put his arm around Aramiss neck and embraced him	140.567626953125
For you he said	289.232421875
Now if I die say to DArtagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for me	240.47760009765625
Embrace also our good and brave Porthos	78.9099349975586
Adieu said Aramis	137.6798553466797
I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world	231.0137481689453
Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Cromwell	34.4640007019043
He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken	68.46228790283203
Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians DArtagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	396.8885498046875
Aramis related what had been agreed upon	62.20185852050781
DArtagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his voice	93.83113861083984
Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight	110.81645965576172
What with DArtagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them	142.3318634033203
I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	141.55767822265625
Two minutes a man makes four minutes	87.5865707397461
Mousqueton will lose another that s five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league	484.5018310546875
Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes	152.5137176513672
Now said he I m off to the bishops	124.62382507324219
Take care of the executioner DArtagnan	166.7852020263672
All right	210.89910888671875
Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door	142.25064086914062
Well do nt be inactive	40.32709884643555
Inactive my dear fellow Ask Porthos	85.95697784423828
I pass my life upon my legs	44.02174377441406
Aramis again presented himself at the bishops	2.000459671020508
Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate	59.25233840942383
Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his side	201.69642639160156
The carriage stopped at the door of the palace	159.57127380371094
It was about nine oclock in the morning	53.847320556640625
Nothing was changed	71.36897277832031
The anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	11.226890563964844
The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy	682.7171020507812
He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aramis	12.963019371032715
The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview	110.86688232421875
The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions	52.72031784057617
Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	234.6123046875
Every one withdrew	18.574462890625
As soon as the door was closed	58.24638366699219
Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has vanished	81.28772735595703
His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than Bristol	16.94295883178711
But the Comte de la Fere asked the king	91.80354309082031
Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor	74.84574127197266
He will answer you	87.28475189208984
The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor	83.01348114013672
So said Charles he who knocks down there	95.93501281738281
Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aramis	60.03763961791992
He is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	458.4665222167969
Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened	41.628299713134766
Oh Juxon said the king seizing the bishops two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety	110.48495483398438
Sire replied Juxon you shall be obeyed	24.292505264282227
Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage	182.7078094482422
Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and nearer	208.9100341796875
It was that of a number of men steadily approaching	65.87706756591797
The four men stood motionless	86.17378997802734
All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	196.60902404785156
A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	10.863143920898438
What is this said Aramis to Juxon	53.303382873535156
Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it	48.41206359863281
Then it is for today asked the king	74.86858367919922
Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning	121.33379364013672
Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner	155.8886260986328
The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead	42.095802307128906
The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs	212.3544464111328
A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tidings	57.5741081237793
But Aramis was livid	63.8858757019043
His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	53.78799057006836
Charles perceived it and took his hand	31.832326889038086
Come my friend said he courage	43.65029525756836
Then he turned to the officer	121.83517456054688
Sir I am ready	22.76946449279785
There is but little reason why I should delay you	77.84194946289062
Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time	62.76718521118164
Will this be permitted me	41.71227264404297
Certainly replied the officer and left the room	331.7195129394531
Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud	42.10135269165039
Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxons hands where is Providence where is Providence	10.35521125793457
My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal Him	73.71552276611328
My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to heart	115.9184341430664
You ask what God is doing	80.49054718017578
God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward	68.95586395263672
Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to God	139.62704467773438
It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep	37.37932586669922
Yes sire said Aramis yes you are right	155.08050537109375
It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them responsible	81.42539978027344
Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his knees	33.720829010009766
I have now to confess to you	49.67131805419922
Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the room	357.3422546386719
Remain Parry	176.78973388671875
I have nothing to say that can not be said before all	77.01361846923828
Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession	223.92083740234375
Chapter LXVI	21.197172164916992
The mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	86.71194458007812
The kings children next arrivedthe Princess Charlotte a beautiful fairhaired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride	86.17485809326172
He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	53.72184371948242
Charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death	107.49388885498047
He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned	92.43163299560547
Then he took the boy upon his knee	27.95134735107422
My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here	28.82706642150879
These men are going to behead your father	385.6612548828125
Do not forget that	17.151477813720703
Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder brothers	266.4989013671875
But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	11.448657035827637
Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown	37.85568618774414
For one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I die	5.782444953918457
Swear my son	94.31757354736328
The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your majesty	131.71739196777344
Henry said Charles call me your father	125.36903381347656
Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king	130.63658142089844
Good my child	80.64805603027344
Now kiss me and you too Charlotte	148.9718017578125
Never forget me	126.43211364746094
Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	48.24105453491211
Farewell said Charles farewell my children	121.55384826660156
Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to die	153.59268188476562
Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open	256.7004089355469
Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	45.957763671875
Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction	182.9584503173828
A deathlike silence reigned in the room above	39.63861846923828
At last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	64.08853149414062
He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold	250.42990112304688
Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea	152.75709533691406
What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding back	84.21451568603516
The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see DArtagnan	77.37570190429688
What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape	115.29403686523438
Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square	49.171199798583984
The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head	54.439125061035156
The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing	161.7964324951172
At the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words	75.76321411132812
Colonel I want to speak to the people	136.65023803710938
Athos shuddered from head to foot	51.20418930053711
It was the king speaking on the scaffold	119.68560028076172
In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement	72.20649719238281
Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	50.82852554321289
He approached the block and laid his axe upon it	30.431602478027344
Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold	103.99159240722656
The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	97.92387390136719
Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day	60.94404983520508
All gazed at him searchingly	97.29827117919922
But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	114.35503387451172
The kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom	61.1596794128418
Oh said Athos to himself is it indeed possible that I hear what I hear and that I see what I see Is it possible that God has abandoned His representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably And I have not seen him I have not said adieu to him	45.0036735534668
A noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block	70.25624084472656
Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	6.8406243324279785
At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people	64.38543701171875
Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon	264.6395263671875
Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta Maria	270.6193542480469
Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment	415.07928466796875
Take it from me when I amdead	167.8566436767578
Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aramis	26.77065658569336
He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	33.966094970703125
One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat	57.218589782714844
Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	79.96266174316406
All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness	121.24917602539062
One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin	57.99673080444336
Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up	190.54310607910156
Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman	75.56593322753906
His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	137.40989685058594
But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aramis	78.47234344482422
The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	46.3369026184082
It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck	41.92237091064453
The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said	129.5877685546875
This block is very low is there no other to be had	189.65847778320312
It is the usual block answered the man in the mask	191.36505126953125
Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king	171.6891632080078
I hope so was the reply	88.49418640136719
There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	74.30062103271484
I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king	37.95368576049805
I shall kneel down to pray do not strike then	14.337763786315918
When shall I strike	78.59236145019531
When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike boldly	106.753173828125
Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms	78.43074798583984
He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	4.351946830749512
Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech you	517.5259399414062
You also stand aside he said to the masked man	134.23121643066406
It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the signal	73.94230651855469
Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there	30.80405044555664
Yes your majesty he answered trembling	53.82283020019531
Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been rescued	171.396728515625
I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to you	62.03654479980469
To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their inheritance	3.810173511505127
A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle Keep	128.5056915283203
You only know that this money exists	26.07419776916504
Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons welfare	37.87729263305664
And now farewell	18.625471115112305
Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with terror	84.9758071899414
A moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember	43.43232345581055
He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow	30.53343963623047
He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract	131.6728057861328
Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	404.8830261230469
At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king	81.6910629272461
Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	13.97276782989502
Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down insensible	299.7397766113281
Chapter LXVII	37.18476486206055
The Man in the Mask	50.777931213378906
The snow was falling thick and icy	174.06854248046875
Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost insensible	185.23121643066406
But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk	380.3502197265625
Well said Aramis beaten by fate	8.811158180236816
Beaten said Athos	60.04960632324219
Noble and unhappy king	308.15582275390625
Are you wounded cried Aramis	87.1901626586914
No this is his blood	14.799680709838867
Where were you then	30.417818069458008
Where you left meunder the scaffold	64.02921295166016
Did you see it all	35.3022346496582
No but I heard all	17.889169692993164
God preserve me from another such hour as I have just passed	149.7699432373047
Then you know that I did not leave him	5925.82177734375
I heard your voice up to the last moment	54.05788040161133
Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the queen	115.21297454833984
Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings blood	54.20216369628906
And what he continued has been done with the poor body	55.101566314697266
By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it	25679.470703125
The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel	141.5170440673828
Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered	19.61859130859375
Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just mounted	87.12586212158203
We are all mortal my poor friends	62.914730072021484
You are late my dear Porthos	17.21827507019043
Yes there were some people on the way who delayed me	16.38599395751953
The wretches were dancing	61.10665512084961
I took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled him	102.12322235107422
Just then a patrol rode up	2.000459671020508
Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk off	7800.927734375
Have you seen DArtagnan	61.833126068115234
We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him again	66.63495635986328
Oh said Athos satirically I saw him	34.5887451171875
He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end	76.84263610839844
Ah Comte de la Fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent	414.4082946777344
This reproof stung Athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing DArtagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying	33.405582427978516
I am not calumniating you my friend	142.5534210205078
They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you were	75.20821380615234
You did nt know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him	67.39470672607422
So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side	76.23479461669922
Ugh I am tired cried DArtagnan sitting down	75.04182434082031
Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh you	6.043705940246582
Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with DArtagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country	9.539655685424805
The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do here	33.983890533447266
You are in a hurry sir count said DArtagnan	64.75228118896484
But what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead	49.03235626220703
Go sir count replied DArtagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in England Well for my part I a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the kings executionI remain	41.79354476928711
Athos turned pale	5235.498046875
Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	97.87210083007812
Ah you remain in London said Porthos	217.949951171875
And you	108.46004486083984
Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with you	304.0434875488281
I ca nt leave you alone in this abominable country	42.14592361450195
Thanks my worthy friend	51.69586944580078
So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone	80.57518005371094
I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings throat	127.4866943359375
A man in a mask cried Athos	24.74017906188965
You did not let the executioner escape then	47.4681396484375
The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine hosts bottles	66.26264953613281
But you remind me	37.21772003173828
Sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth	126.12357330322266
Let out your prisoner	104.81105041503906
All is over	77.25758361816406
But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king	11.29278564453125
An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss	32.5313720703125
Did you not see his face asked Athos	20.568382263183594
He wore a mask	362.412353515625
But you Aramis who were close to him	103.23822784423828
I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask	94.7440414428711
Then it must be a man of a certain age	15.507743835449219
Oh said DArtagnan that matters little	40.671119689941406
When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it	155.43785095214844
I am sorry I did not follow him said Porthos	316.4177551269531
Well my dear Porthos said DArtagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do	98.11812591552734
Athos understood all now	100.74803924560547
Pardon me DArtagnan he said	126.19419860839844
I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust you	249.25596618652344
Pardon me my friend	43.04497146606445
We will see about that presently said DArtagnan with a slight smile	127.27725982666016
Well then said Aramis	240.286865234375
Well while I was watchingnot the king as monsieur le comte thinks for I know what it is to see a man led to death and though I ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me illwhile I was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as I said to find out who he was	98.19390106201172
Now as we are wo nt to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there for I had seen you Aramis with the king and you count I knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason I forgive you he added offering Athos his hand for you must have suffered much	54.4798469543457
I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	74.77054595947266
Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other	29.856800079345703
And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parrys brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his strength	435.6721496582031
Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grimaud	74.46480560302734
Oh said I to him	258.4014587402344
Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	117.84127807617188
Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one another	25.87042999267578
Well everything was finished as you know	479.19158935546875
The mob dispersed	88.12384033203125
I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square	157.27296447753906
I saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear	71.7647705078125
Five minutes later he came down the grand staircase	88.85613250732422
You followed him cried Athos	47.4681396484375
I should think so but not without difficulty	77.5908432006836
Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	127.54524993896484
I might have gone up to him and killed him	66.97376251220703
But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter	32.81114196777344
So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated house	146.51486206054688
Grimaud drew out a pistol	168.7350616455078
Eh said he showing it	105.9979019165039
I held back his arm	450.846923828125
The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	53.91830062866211
Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road	540.3325805664062
Next moment the door opened and the man disappeared	481.2481384277344
The scoundrel said Aramis	99.34659576416016
While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him	115.5230712890625
Come now Aramis said DArtagnan you must be taking me for some one else	64.6308364868164
Nevertheless said Athos in your absence	212.051513671875
Well in my absence have nt I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all sides	7.81823205947876
At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again	89.9588623046875
Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I am	129.4750518798828
Our game is beaten up	45.4605598449707
Now for the tallyho	34.49800109863281
Athos threw himself into DArtagnans arms	4.351946830749512
Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times wrong	67.22838592529297
I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt	93.18785858154297
Humph said Porthos	149.6291046142578
Do nt you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself	86.79650115966797
Ah just so	50.70169448852539
Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise	44.470245361328125
Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide	63.6845588684082
No no continued DArtagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	109.0430679321289
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman	410.0037536621094
A gentleman exclaimed Athos	70.73150634765625
Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the nobility	95.93836212158203
Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the windows	127.6872787475586
Fine sport	342.9241027832031
Are you still bent on departure Athos asked DArtagnan	122.65719604492188
No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	74.63607788085938
Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a moment	85.89068603515625
The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game	96.01071166992188
The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted	254.5260009765625
DArtagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question	46.29405975341797
For a moment DArtagnan thought that Parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	37.108917236328125
The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him	61.743324279785156
He rose however as they approached	83.1383056640625
Come said Athos heres another good servant	61.15040969848633
Really honest men are not so scarce as I thought	90.2239990234375
Do nt be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman	128.54847717285156
I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vindictive	90.05839538574219
I should not like to be Groslow if he meets him	61.386409759521484
Well said Athos to the man in English	329.0851745605469
No one has come out he replied	23.29887580871582
Then Porthos and Aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to Grimaud	118.43412017822266
Grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle	117.90411376953125
Soho cried Athos	19.82069969177246
Yes said Grimaud	37.28934860229492
Well has anybody come out	106.07081604003906
No but somebody has gone in	126.3751449584961
A man or a woman	20.65546989440918
A man	208.49851989746094
Ah ah said DArtagnan there are two of them then	17.31401824951172
I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be equal	111.80298614501953
Perhaps there are four said DArtagnan	142.75550842285156
What do you mean	276.5820617675781
Other men may have entered before them and waited for them	128.93080139160156
We can find out said Grimaud	41.84568786621094
At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed	39.425994873046875
That is true said DArtagnan let us call the others	33.566226959228516
They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aramis	173.5650177001953
Have you seen anything they asked	288.8056335449219
No but we are going to replied DArtagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	43.934810638427734
All four came up together	102.21495819091797
Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	54.89907455444336
Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right	107.3217544555664
Well asked DArtagnan	75.97358703613281
Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out	46.086910247802734
Speak said Athos we can not see your signs	113.72760772705078
How many are there	48.02730178833008
One opposite to me the other with his back to me	119.4129409790039
And the man opposite to you is	163.68959045410156
The man I saw go in	2.000459671020508
Do you know him	56.14501190185547
I thought I recognized him and was not mistaken	160.841064453125
Short and stout	69.97345733642578
Who is it they all asked together in a low tone	346.4715576171875
General Oliver Cromwell	152.7670135498047
The four friends looked at one another	96.79308319091797
And the other asked Athos	878.2210083007812
Thin and lanky	783.2412109375
The executioner said DArtagnan and Aramis at the same time	42.552459716796875
I can see nothing but his back resumed Grimaud	19.173152923583984
But wait	113.73200225830078
He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to see	42.356117248535156
And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan	187.57827758789062
Did you see him they all asked	79.25286102294922
Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on end	81.64179992675781
The thin spare man	98.36973571777344
The executioner in short asked Aramis	85.11900329589844
And who is it said Porthos	143.81109619140625
Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters hand	107.18453979492188
Who He asked Athos	49.888633728027344
Mordaunt replied Grimaud	514.229736328125
DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy	4.017708778381348
Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow	41.894283294677734
Fatality he muttered	253.3921661376953
Chapter LXVIII	72.25347900390625
Cromwells House	21.00297737121582
It was in fact Mordaunt whom DArtagnan had followed without knowing it	77.81768035888672
On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk	68.4849853515625
This man was Cromwell	42.05961608886719
Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London unknown except to the most intimate of his friends	48.36565017700195
Mordaunt was among these	137.07815551757812
It is you Mordaunt he said	86.5419692993164
You are late	248.23851013183594
General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me	6.1407599449157715
Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as that	35.52007293701172
I am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of them	63.69275665283203
But you general were you not at Whitehall	91.40727996826172
No said Cromwell	29.470365524291992
There was a moments silence	305.1233215332031
Have you had any account of it	103.12525939941406
I have been here since the morning	137.74472045898438
I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king	81.18704223632812
Ah you knew that said Mordaunt	71.37088012695312
It matters little	22.359912872314453
Four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was waiting	84.90577697753906
And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive	108.12176513671875
Tranquil yes replied Cromwell	217.64181518554688
But who told you I was inactive	68.03568267822266
Butif the plot had succeeded	205.042236328125
I wished it to do so	55.74470901489258
I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles I	56.63179016113281
as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of England	254.34217834472656
Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold	58.798744201660156
Why so asked Mordaunt	72.67987823486328
Cromwell smiled	450.8731689453125
Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity	17.920196533203125
But if he had escaped	33.03738021850586
Impossible my precautions were taken	96.9195327758789
And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him	66.65510559082031
The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to me	45.572044372558594
And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done	25.75242805480957
It is possible	30.725683212280273
But he will not avow it	21.526914596557617
How so	59.12290573120117
Because they failed	45.74728775024414
Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles I	34.2242317199707
Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them	87.55633544921875
Take them said Cromwell	37.63448715209961
Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	102.27034759521484
Did the people shout at all Cromwell asked	926.5439453125
Very little except Long live Cromwell	59.08564758300781
Where were you placed	160.4829864501953
Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything	108.17024230957031
But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwells	83.06368255615234
I was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	36.29710388183594
It was now Cromwells turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetrable	46.54122543334961
It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	196.53770446777344
The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand	29.801149368286133
Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain	26.310277938842773
In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed	172.52854919433594
Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Cromwell	125.16057586669922
Do you think so sir He did not look like an executioner	66.27873992919922
And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office	30.939062118530273
But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	26.83131980895996
Perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of Fate	53.47657775878906
And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action	62.55259704589844
It is not for me to judge	53.79742431640625
It rests between his conscience and his God	18.393627166748047
But if your honor knew this man	71.25468444824219
I neither know nor wish to know him	99.1575698852539
Provided Charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank	242.3542022705078
And yet without the man the king would have been rescued	133.77511596679688
Cromwell smiled	23.79461669921875
They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold	76.53440856933594
Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mordaunt	62.88414001464844
Yes they would have all been blown up	125.24868774414062
Just so	103.56403350830078
The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	75.37519836425781
Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by Gods	174.990966796875
You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has done	162.49290466308594
Mordaunt bowed humbly	29.755420684814453
Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime	139.57704162597656
Say absurd since it has become useless	68.6065673828125
The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	16.028322219848633
So tonight Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca Lightning	71.63317108154297
Show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed	243.31678771972656
Unless said Mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as Cromwell spoke	249.8653564453125
This skiff might be of use to you for personal projects	309.7198486328125
Oh my lord my lord	76.50999450683594
That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public	118.6601791381836
But your honor will soon be called so generally	148.16221618652344
I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	54.277610778808594
You are going sir	47.75172424316406
Yes said Cromwell	71.16921997070312
I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed	57.81319808959961
Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight	163.8984375
And even for all day tomorrow if you want it	33.62370681762695
Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that I should give you time	91.13309478759766
Thank you sir it will be well employed I hope	53.92070007324219
Cromwell turned as he was going	118.59913635253906
Are you armed he asked	115.69131469726562
I have my sword	175.67074584960938
And no one waiting for you outside	88.26589965820312
Then you had better come with me	84.77365112304688
Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to lose	243.78817749023438
Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it	848.155029296875
It closed after him with a spring	8.229819297790527
This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future Protector	162.1750030517578
It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	220.45431518554688
DArtagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	154.2373504638672
Mordaunt he cried	141.74822998046875
Ah by Heaven it is God Himself who sent us here	363.88006591796875
Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him	152.1081085205078
No replied DArtagnan no noise	56.785682678222656
Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed	292.9608459472656
If he comes out we shall catch him	190.64662170410156
If he stays in we will break in the window	75.88643646240234
It is easier and less noisy than the door	234.16905212402344
Grimaud began to scale the wall again	28.20511245727539
Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aramis	56.69926071166992
Porthos and I will stay here	51.682952880859375
The friends obeyed	163.24327087402344
He is alone said Grimaud	2.000459671020508
We did not see his companion come out	606.9401245117188
He may have gone by the other door	49.228885650634766
What is he doing	100.9684066772461
Putting on his cloak and gloves	80.86080932617188
He s ours muttered DArtagnan	87.51359558105469
Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	168.43511962890625
Put it up again my friend said DArtagnan	212.34716796875
We must proceed in an orderly manner	211.2404022216797
Hush said Grimaud he is coming out	97.01825714111328
He has put out the lamp I can see nothing now	2411.69140625
Get down then and quickly	109.71154022216797
Grimaud leaped down	79.3561019897461
The snow deadened the noise of his fall	46.50355529785156
Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him	132.90411376953125
We will do the same	13.63775634765625
The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with DArtagnan	59.4887809753418
Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	373.6565246582031
Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	83.87730407714844
DArtagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	218.61672973632812
At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Cromwell	112.46713256835938
Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room	77.90254974365234
Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	46.50065231323242
Oblige me by taking a seat said DArtagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but calm	100.45632934570312
Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew their chairs near him	22.439693450927734
Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings	234.8975372314453
He seemed to be quite overcome	71.69878387451172
Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience	142.24012756347656
Aramis bit his lips till the blood came	138.76742553710938
DArtagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	39.01761245727539
Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please	157.483154296875
Chapter LXIX	741.79443359375
Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	130.42410278320312
His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand	102.23279571533203
DArtagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	121.78759765625
Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things	127.8025894165039
Porthos sucked his mustache muttering A good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder	19.91995620727539
Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	88.77295684814453
The silence however could not last forever	744.0812377929688
So DArtagnan began	85.13909912109375
Sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as I have seen the Italian mummers do whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in France	88.27310180664062
Mordaunt did not reply	194.95040893554688
Just now DArtagnan continued you were disguisedI mean to say attiredas a murderer and now	41.05662536621094
And now I look very much like a man who is going to be murdered	7.704005718231201
Oh sir said DArtagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side	69.58456420898438
No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers	515.5201416015625
Well that is scarcely the question	124.878662109375
I had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume	181.74607849121094
The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	69.00951385498047
Why then have you laid it aside	337.9464416503906
Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four executioners	290.9455871582031
Sir replied DArtagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	42.18715286254883
What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion	108.84783935546875
We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us	255.02493286132812
Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation	92.28229522705078
Porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	45.48735046386719
Pardon me said DArtagnan	2187.428955078125
Do not let us do things in a hurry	43.62372589111328
We will arrange the matter rather better	116.18206024169922
Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us	72.00367736816406
All replied Mordaunt	25.031002044677734
Then my dear sir I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also	63.80845642089844
Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this	829.7782592773438
So saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace	3025.251708984375
At your service sir he continued	11527.98046875
My sword is shorter than yours its true but bah I think the arm will make up for the sword	168.60508728027344
Halt cried Porthos coming forward	101.53419494628906
I begin and without any rhetoric	35.429874420166016
Allow me Porthos said Aramis	123.13426971435547
Athos did not move	67.7053451538086
He might have been taken for a statue	61.70329666137695
Even his breathing seemed to be arrested	9.508397102355957
Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall have your turn	26.211742401123047
Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	98.19563293457031
You can see it in his eye	87.82000732421875
So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laudable	78.20380401611328
Besides we will have no words about it	121.00030517578125
I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will begin	55.76097869873047
Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword DArtagnan turned to his adversary	54.1212272644043
Sir I am waiting for you	74.8853988647461
And for my part gentlemen I admire you	74.00502014160156
You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter	92.36717224121094
I hate you all but not equally	37.27391815185547
I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	154.86553955078125
I claim then the right to choose my opponent	845.0824584960938
If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not fight	140.7616729736328
It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of them	85.13227081298828
Athos and DArtagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	58.96428298950195
Well then said Mordaunt I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Athos	231.8849639892578
Athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is impossible	14.624974250793457
Submit this honour to somebody else	148.5503692626953
And he sat down	176.65725708007812
Ah said Mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid	50.211517333984375
Zounds exclaimed DArtagnan bounding toward him who says that Athos is afraid	101.72488403320312
Let him have his say DArtagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and contempt	54.3067741394043
Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gascon	70.2213363647461
You hear sir said DArtagnan turning to Mordaunt	142.11314392089844
The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	79.80184936523438
Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la Fere	36.857513427734375
As long as I do nt fight with him it is the same to me with whom I fight	35.38117599487305
Put your names into a hat and draw lots	27.416074752807617
A good idea said DArtagnan	82.51948547363281
At least that will conciliate us all said Aramis	158.75987243652344
I should never have thought of that said Porthos and yet it is very simple	27.57476234436035
Come Aramis said DArtagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham	58.77505874633789
Mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	110.3736801147461
He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances	14.532352447509766
If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride	79.31353759765625
Aramis went to Cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to Mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis	212.41452026367188
He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mordaunt	86.98958587646484
Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it	372.0663146972656
Ah serpent muttered DArtagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name	49.18733215332031
Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read DArtagnan	136.90394592285156
The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt	19.078697204589844
I hope sir said he you have no objection to make	169.53970336914062
None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot	55.20644760131836
The moment that DArtagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	163.85108947753906
He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner	34.38915252685547
Are you ready sir he said at last	265.53521728515625
I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe	223.54478454589844
Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rapier	243.14468383789062
Nor I either	57.79520034790039
So much the better that sets my mind at rest	108.3336181640625
Defend yourself	37.79358673095703
One minute said the young man	138.63111877441406
Give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other	148.3689422607422
Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper	68.85745239257812
No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now	11.328502655029297
It is for something else than that I imagine muttered DArtagnan shaking his head doubtfully	7.268324851989746
On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porthos	183.23582458496094
In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room	388.5137023925781
We shall require it	116.14090728759766
Yes gentlemen said DArtagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to do	355.1875
This new attack made no impression on Mordaunt	26.21631622314453
The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	98.96903991699219
DArtagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent	196.07791137695312
He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt parried	63.773990631103516
Aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	178.70657348632812
And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	80.3167953491211
This time it was Mordaunt who smiled	159.3443145751953
Ah sir said DArtagnan you have a wicked smile	42.89018249511719
It must have been the devil who taught it you was it not	145.9494171142578
Mordaunt replied by trying his opponents weapon with an amount of strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest	160.0164031982422
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step	97.57322692871094
Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours	101.47282409667969
You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	102.04076385498047
Look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable countenance	89.05842590332031
To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of DArtagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with DArtagnan	139.62937927246094
He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon anxious	238.735595703125
Come come cried DArtagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment	276.187744140625
However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	26.044307708740234
Ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed DArtagnan	47.087806701660156
Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall No	69.62837219238281
Well then you shall see it now	58.44475173950195
In a second DArtagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him	415.4644470214844
The three friends looked on panting and astonished	64.25609588623047
At last DArtagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way Mordaunt disappeared through the opening and DArtagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	30.10318946838379
DArtagnan sprang back the wall had closed again	72.3796157836914
Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared	63.55571365356445
The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel	815.06787109375
Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan we must break in this door	90.48876190185547
It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening forward	146.50340270996094
He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain	77.74999237060547
Sblood he escapes us	59.636898040771484
So much the better muttered Athos	119.84526824951172
I thought as much said DArtagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts	1841.774169921875
Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	431.3372497558594
I thought he was up to something	117.46842193603516
Its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aramis	22.969432830810547
Its a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much relieved	28.910783767700195
Really said DArtagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts Athos I can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way	307.2463073730469
You can not understand the position we are in	7.526597499847412
In this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	70.86293029785156
This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place	47.892181396484375
Come come we must be off	32.28533172607422
If we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us	125.33914184570312
Yes you are right	231.5082244873047
But where shall we go asked Porthos	74.65130615234375
To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please God to France where at least I understand the architecture of the houses	99.8191146850586
So suiting the action to the word DArtagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others	123.41059112548828
Chapter LXX	107.97962188720703
The Skiff Lightning	7424.18701171875
DArtagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none	91.71586608886719
He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that	36.529422760009766
This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	38.0651969909668
After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	199.93783569335938
Good he said nothing almost nothingscratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast	41.964962005615234
The wounds that I make are better than thatwitness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King Charles	72.5752944946289
Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them	155.56874084472656
They must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of Gods	189.54075622558594
They must disappear broken scattered annihilated	37.850181579589844
I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do	7.338489055633545
Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant	514.7243041992188
He made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	51.24518585205078
Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road	17.715152740478516
A quarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich	53.65216064453125
There is the port he murmured	63.765174865722656
That dark point yonder is the Isle of Dogs	270.8136291503906
Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	314.9209899902344
Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless haste	69.40019226074219
Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which I wonder is the Lightning	121.96369171142578
At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him	3.918487548828125
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	219.74127197265625
He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face	47.882999420166016
Do you wish to go on the water sir said the sailor	2.000459671020508
Yes just so	74.65130615234375
Along the Isle of Dogs	165.48483276367188
And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	151.7271270751953
You would like one that sails as rapidly as	112.34669494628906
Lightning interrupted Mordaunt	289.2337951660156
Then mine is the boat you want sir	111.53982543945312
I m your man	67.10978698730469
I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal	51.91329574584961
Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner	194.1880340576172
Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his horse	469.8770751953125
There s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel	83.16799926757812
But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of you	256.63031005859375
Listen to me sir	122.94998168945312
I m not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogerss post are you not under orders from General Cromwell	115.97482299804688
Mine also are from him	108.1578140258789
Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mordaunt	94.8884048461914
Mordaunt was startled	77.25894165039062
Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face	529.8687133789062
I am a friend	124.20853424072266
Captain Groslow cried Mordaunt	197.71011352539062
The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition	61.7119140625
Is there anything new in the wind	126.32563018798828
I thought perhaps that the kings death	122.8105239868164
Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here	39.76206588745117
What have you come for then	168.65968322753906
To embark with you	92.30561828613281
Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity	77.59487915039062
No but I wish to have a share in my revenge	25.099411010742188
Have nt you some one who will relieve me of my horse	76.59891510009766
Groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	175.62033081054688
Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn	48.84012222290039
If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman	42.996734619140625
The sailor departed without reply	43.20471954345703
Now said Mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you	105.70152282714844
There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this	95.22145080566406
Besides even you did nt recognize me they will be much less likely to	151.873291015625
That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you	448.57025146484375
Everything is ready is it not	100.34520721435547
The cargo on board	80.5013656616211
Five full casks	32.771942138671875
And fifty empty ones	132.063720703125
We are carrying port wine to Anvers	34.54828643798828
Now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here	36.450782775878906
I am ready	85.9209213256836
It is important that none of your crew should see me	158.34495544433594
I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of myself	39.270694732666016
Besides he does nt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan	62.296546936035156
Very well let us go	173.72341918945312
They then went down to the Thames	30.363794326782227
A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake	280.6604309082031
Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs	39.0728874206543
When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	159.2637176513672
He went with Groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat	229.34161376953125
They will have nothing to do then at this end said Mordaunt	109.63262939453125
Nothing at all	89.87289428710938
That s a capital arrangement	100.91049194335938
Return to Greenwich and bring them here	83.39086151123047
I shall hide myself in your cabin	86.41211700439453
You have a longboat	55.88336944580078
That in which we came	95.87091064453125
It appeared light and well constructed	118.06050872802734
Quite a canoe	59.97848892211914
Fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord	5.729647636413574
Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with	70.91160583496094
Consider all this done	220.3108673095703
Do you wish to see the powderroom	40.942989349365234
When you return I will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them	164.8926544189453
Never fear	90.24508666992188
There s ten oclock striking at Greenwich	70.76223754882812
Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached Greenwich	285.2010803222656
The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road	14.937614440917969
These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of DArtagnan and Athos	109.93562316894531
As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	91.9189682006836
Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst DArtagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully	65.85809326171875
On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen	47.1922607421875
He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them	56.10746765136719
What do you want with us he asked of Groslow	53.135074615478516
I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find him	169.8102569580078
He fell down this morning and broke his leg	67.94273376464844
But I m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which I have in my pocket	157.91221618652344
And he drew out the handkerchief	73.1929702758789
Was that all he said inquired Athos	41.973472595214844
No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in France	152.93719482421875
What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to DArtagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in English	28.08483123779297
It seems a likely story to me	85.2777328491211
And to me too	9.550667762756348
Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our captain	196.1289520263672
I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us	13.622007369995117
My dear friend you guess well	52.213462829589844
My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about navigation	54.60426712036133
You see cried DArtagnan	455.7864990234375
They then summoned their friends who with Blaisois Mousqueton and Grimaud promptly joined them leaving Parry behind them who was to take back to London the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him	24.09307289123535
Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents	98.1644515991211
Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway declined	67.39686584472656
It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Groslow	28.42496109008789
It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parrys head	183.69178771972656
DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him	110.36048126220703
He found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating	237.70846557617188
He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions	69.38665771484375
A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascons uneasiness	100.00453186035156
We have no time now for suspicions said Athos	106.87638092041016
The boat is waiting for us come	368.08197021484375
Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time We can watch the skipper	49.26118850708008
And if he does nt go straight I will crush him that s all	59.15372848510742
Well said Porthos replied DArtagnan	15.104537963867188
Let us go then	144.45858764648438
You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat	65.58698272705078
The three valets passed without accident	46.106571197509766
Athos followed them then Porthos then Aramis	243.41636657714844
DArtagnan went last still shaking his head	44.06205749511719
What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porthos	111.8653793334961
Upon my word you would make Caesar afraid	533.5864868164062
The matter is replied DArtagnan that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman	315.3114929199219
And you complain of that said Porthos	140.23989868164062
Everything goes as if in flowery paths	300.929443359375
Everything goes too well Porthos	116.08609771728516
But no matter we must trust in God	94.64911651611328
As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boathook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved	72.30972290039062
The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row	13.7198486328125
As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	46.73517990112305
At last we are off exclaimed Porthos	111.88191986083984
Alas said Athos we depart alone	209.63140869140625
Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation	89.21845245361328
We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent DArtagnan beware of misadventure	146.71249389648438
Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens	85.25564575195312
Who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one	139.0773162841797
Yes but tomorrow morning	161.2037811279297
Tomorrow we shall be at Boulogne	58.108150482177734
I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my weakness	159.7443084716797
Yes Athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us	25.395645141601562
But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors	114.86283874511719
Bah much Monsieur Mordaunt would care	71.52879333496094
You do nt imagine he would consider a little thing like that	166.22230529785156
At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear DArtagnan admit that he is afraid	101.20565032958984
I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon I m not such a rhinoceros as you are	67.66767883300781
Oho what s that	77.1366958618164
The Lightning answered the captain our felucca	176.1021728515625
So far so good laughed Athos	305.8891296386719
They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one	41.37064743041992
Stop a moment cried DArtagnan pray how many men have you on board captain	112.47909545898438
I do nt understand was the reply	73.72423553466797
Explain it Athos	193.77835083007812
Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting myself	529.5524291992188
DArtagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	68.5075454711914
Oh he exclaimed I begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the boat	111.7856674194336
As for me said Porthos I will see to the supper	114.40095520019531
A very good idea Porthos said the Gascon	27.2371768951416
Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my interpreter	84.31774139404297
Go Grimaud said Athos	42.976463317871094
DArtagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck	15.128554344177246
This was divided into three compartmentsone which was covered by the floor of that room in which Athos Porthos and Aramis were to pass the night the second was to serve as the sleepingroom for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which Mordaunt was concealed	69.5106430053711
Oho cried DArtagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Baba	103.34529876708984
What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the casks	303.8104553222656
The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered	39.10849380493164
Port wine	47.728004455566406
Ah port wine tis a comfort said the Gascon since we shall not die of thirst	217.2806396484375
Are they all full	71.95003509521484
Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered	197.2661895751953
Some full others empty	50.40570068359375
DArtagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captains alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them	63.10404968261719
Come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment	104.76763153076172
Stop said the Englishman I have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing supper	31.68951988220215
Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment	79.27587890625
This was the room appropriated to the sailors	99.9729232788086
Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture	200.8894805908203
DArtagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	153.8327178955078
And this room he asked pointing to the captains cabin	46.138221740722656
That s my room replied Groslow	2.000459671020508
Open the door	43.83501434326172
The captain obeyed	27.38068389892578
DArtagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed	147.59597778320312
Good he said	104.27143096923828
If there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	121.37777709960938
Let us see what Porthos has found for supper	127.21839904785156
And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were	4117.83154296875
Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	460.5247802734375
He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when DArtagnan returned	237.70846557617188
Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	93.47726440429688
Well said Aramis	209.5912322998047
All is well we may sleep tranquilly	60.09368896484375
On this assurance the two friends fell asleep and DArtagnan who was very weary bade goodnight to Grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him	279.44256591796875
Chapter LXXI	125.06327056884766
Port Wine	85.02213287353516
In ten minutes the masters slept not so the servantshungry and more thirsty than hungry	56.60568618774414
Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	62.12236404418945
On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	8.375465393066406
This cursed rolling said Blaisois	99.4638671875
I know it will serve me as it did when we came over	27.452627182006836
And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	18.357868194580078
But where is your wicker flask Monsieur Mousqueton Have you lost it asked Blaisois	128.99635314941406
No replied Mousqueton Parry kept it	90.46602630615234
Those devilish Scotchmen are always thirsty	70.29088592529297
And you Grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with DArtagnan are you thirsty	107.47461700439453
As thirsty as a Scotchman was Grimauds laconic reply	147.52139282226562
And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed	54.45441818237305
Oh lackadaisy I m beginning to feel queer cried Blaisois	381.7644348144531
If that s the case said Mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment	143.43019104003906
Do you call that nourishment said Blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table	26.105411529541016
Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask Grimaud	46.273136138916016
Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink	74.4249038696289
As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the English	249.34178161621094
What Monsieur Mousqueton The Englishdo they dislike wine	297.2071533203125
They hate it	271.2723388671875
But I have seen them drink it	31.08023452758789
As a punishment	4.629002094268799
For example an English prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of Malmsey	66.15934753417969
I heard the Chevalier dHerblay say so	48.52827072143555
The fool cried Blaisois I wish I had been in his place	129.77073669433594
Thou canst be said Grimaud writing down his figures	138.61558532714844
How asked Blaisois I can Explain yourself	106.6343765258789
Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	131.40786743164062
Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by DArtagnan and himself	34.94041442871094
Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door	166.12229919433594
Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh sum	63.258750915527344
I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good wine	179.00601196289062
Excellent exclaimed Mousqueton smacking his lips	39.325225830078125
Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux	84.83296966552734
Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blaisois	151.04872131347656
Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left	104.2090072631836
One may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	106.34540557861328
Why buy what one can take	319.6882629394531
Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to me	249.9333953857422
Where forbidden asked Mousqueton	15.257376670837402
In the commandments of God or of the church I do nt know which	32.348724365234375
I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his wife	28.439210891723633
That is a childs reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing manner	101.06367492675781
Yes you talk like a childI repeat the word	124.0435791015625
Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors	168.28717041015625
Where that is true said Blaisois at least I ca nt now recall it	367.9430236816406
A childs reasonI repeat it continued Mousqueton	313.3771667480469
If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies	110.53839111328125
Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to us	134.93643188476562
And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion	245.7820281982422
Mousqueton smiled disdainfully	101.35159301757812
I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is thirsty	179.53994750976562
What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not	184.3520050048828
Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his head	205.80352783203125
Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	29.803068161010742
Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop	30.513734817504883
His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was	180.7903594970703
Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are	102.15750885009766
Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset	35.49052810668945
Locked repeated Mousqueton	57.6852912902832
But Blaisois ventured to say I have heard you relate Monsieur Mousqueton that once on a time at Chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose	73.1863784790039
Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles	57.09408950805664
I can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds	169.75091552734375
No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet	63.562538146972656
Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit	13.35024642944336
Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask	58.065162658691406
Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his accounts	40.35923385620117
Ah yes said Mousqueton	65.38491821289062
Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	464.92327880859375
Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	190.4530792236328
In a few minutes he had extracted three boards	50.321144104003906
He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through	27.641130447387695
He sighed and set to work again	84.74629211425781
Grimaud had now finished his accounts	47.48768997192383
He arose and stood near Mousqueton	80.82264709472656
I he said	12.644322395324707
What said Mousqueton	47.8581428527832
I can pass	161.33328247070312
That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass easily	21.51396369934082
And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier dArtagnan	2.000459671020508
Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur Mouston	119.1738510131836
I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqued	41.30509948730469
Yes but that would take too much time and I am thirsty	108.34363555908203
I am getting more and more seasick	46.299434661865234
Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	160.85218811035156
Rinse the glasses said Grimaud	50.56487274169922
Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	255.19912719726562
Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies	79.50691986083984
Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful	106.69673156738281
You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty	157.10813903808594
My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the hold	35.29365921020508
What do you want asked Blaisois	45.59914016723633
My cloakstop up the aperture with it	516.5509033203125
Why asked Blaisois	75.44232940673828
Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the room	73.25271606445312
Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar	45.80914306640625
Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqueton	92.81681060791016
That is lucky said Blaisois	62.1453857421875
As for me when I have no candle I ca nt take two steps without knocking against something	115.0918960571289
That s because you have nt served said Mousqueton	56.90047073364258
Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven	119.19306945800781
But hark I think some one is coming	122.23145294189453
Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example	99.81525421142578
Blaisois obeyed	119.38709259033203
The door of their cabin was opened	90.48172760009766
Two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared	56.05922317504883
Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven	137.17291259765625
That s against all rules	90.72361755371094
In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring	91.33660888671875
These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them	265.99664306640625
Ah cried Blaisois he is lost	78.60057067871094
Grimauds a cunning fellow murmured Mousqueton	334.8169250488281
They waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that Grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	361.220703125
Shall we obey asked Blaisois	121.24594116210938
All this looks suspicious	98.0478744506836
They said a quarter of an hour	60.47626876831055
We still have five minutes replied Mousqueton	118.81519317626953
Suppose we warn the masters	36.2800407409668
Lets wait for Grimaud	173.37269592285156
But perhaps they have killed him	19.697938919067383
Grimaud would have cried out	53.469322204589844
You know he is almost dumb	296.8438720703125
We should have heard the blow then	248.3758544921875
But if he does nt return	48.81062698364258
Here he is	168.0112762451172
At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	484.5688171386719
He held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable Oh with such an expression of extreme terror that Mousqueton started alarmed and Blaisois was near fainting from fright	68.96231079101562
Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gunpowder	266.2645568847656
Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake DArtagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place	29.108989715576172
Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	59.65052032470703
This was the gist of his strange story	15.327762603759766
The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was empty	123.89862823486328
He passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full	49.7991828918457
At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard	132.94677734375
Whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which Grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	261.3950500488281
This was Groslow	170.675048828125
He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line	37.95580291748047
His face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	385.766845703125
Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one	99.90482330322266
Have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern	63.8862419128418
Here it is answered the other	113.53763580322266
At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow	36.43716049194336
He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mordaunt	215.52273559570312
How long will this fuse burn asked this person	37.73345947265625
About five minutes replied the captain	3175.223388671875
That voice also was known to Grimaud	56.27442169189453
He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow	55.20850372314453
Then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why now	113.47328186035156
When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men	104.6171646118164
Get down into the longboat	61.43739318847656
That is when I have lighted the match	142.18446350097656
I will undertake that	53.16651153564453
I wish to be sure of my revenge	12.921100616455078
Are the oars in the boat	10.3351411819458
Everything is ready	72.4720687866211
Tis well	249.32655334472656
Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match	55.233123779296875
He then arose	46.72978591918945
You hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty minutes	115.44862365722656
I understand all perfectly sir replied Groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train	138.34149169921875
My dear Groslow answered Mordaunt you know the French proverb Nothing one does not do ones self is ever well done	54.58799743652344
I shall abide by that rule	32.94879150390625
Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it	123.97563171386719
But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language	68.1514663696289
He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in French	155.78965759277344
Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder	22.12259292602539
Mordaunt went away with the captain	60.991703033447266
At the door he stopped to listen	67.01493072509766
Do you hear how they sleep he asked	85.93206024169922
In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	110.34242248535156
Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Groslow	71.1197280883789
This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mordaunt	123.45921325683594
And they went out together	176.18844604492188
Chapter LXXII	30.15148162841797
End of the Port Wine Mystery	145.50352478027344
Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture	80.2791519165039
Ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty	27.63629722595215
He made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare	81.89386749267578
It may be imagined that DArtagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to Aramiss ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement	86.80648040771484
Chevalier he said get up and do nt make the least noise	42.789695739746094
Aramis awoke	12.74901294708252
DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	185.93923950195312
Aramis obeyed	89.76367950439453
Athos is near you said DArtagnan warn him as I have warned you	92.25659942626953
Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution	86.65448760986328
But there was more difficulty in arousing Porthos	101.96085357666016
He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when DArtagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	302.82806396484375
Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another	57.5945930480957
Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men	45.36607360839844
Bah said Athos are you still afraid	73.88411712646484
Do you know who is captain of this vessel	74.56588745117188
Captain Groslow	76.59873962402344
The shudder of the three musketeers showed to DArtagnan that his words began to make some impression on them	50.67461395263672
Groslow said Aramis the devil	165.11752319335938
Who is this Groslow asked Porthos	45.56431198120117
I do nt remember him	171.311767578125
Groslow is the man who broke Parrys head and is now getting ready to break ours	186.72032165527344
Oh oh	140.5230712890625
And do you know who is his lieutenant	503.333251953125
His lieutenant There is none said Athos	87.5230712890625
They do nt have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four	42.27287673950195
Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt	134.97079467773438
This time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried out	262.28790283203125
Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	63.1358642578125
What shall we do said Athos	53.80451965332031
We must seize the felucca said Aramis	36.43028259277344
And kill him said Porthos	106.83576965332031
The felucca is mined said DArtagnan	190.5257568359375
Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with powder	122.8847427368164
When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell	215.39381408691406
You have some plan then asked Athos	156.46116638183594
What is it	118.9530029296875
Have you confidence in me	106.8299560546875
Give your orders said the three musketeers	310.3890075683594
Very well come this way	63.302894592285156
DArtagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	135.37680053710938
He turned it gently on its hinges	115.93402862548828
There he said is our road	85.74946594238281
The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aramis	29.390289306640625
Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm presently	138.2519989013672
But we can not swim to the shore	15.125297546386719
The longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca	24.358686447143555
We will take possession of it and cut the cable	95.7881088256836
Come my friends	178.3164520263672
A moments delay said Athos our servants	18.138538360595703
Here we are they cried	47.7514533996582
Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which DArtagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	73.95073699951172
Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	24.753313064575195
Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried DArtagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do	829.71337890625
I do not hesitate you know said Grimaud	70.01978302001953
Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in rivers	68.39080047607422
And I not at all said Mousqueton	118.44552612304688
But DArtagnan had now slipped through the window	192.7345733642578
You have decided friend said Athos	150.2469024658203
Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body	66.0792007446289
Do you Aramis order the servants	59.533931732177734
Porthos kill every one who stands in your way	215.89633178710938
And after pressing the hand of Athos DArtagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	60.685874938964844
Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	130.92938232421875
DArtagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water	562.9677734375
In one second Athos joined him	1009.9185180664062
Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grimaud	158.11732482910156
I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in rivers	94.14804077148438
When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	147.83489990234375
To the boat to the boat	85.71013641357422
But Porthos I do not see him	58.50556564331055
Porthos is cominghe swims like Leviathan	2509.629638671875
In fact Porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward	69.44538116455078
Come come said Porthos jump in	97.25740814208984
But monsieur said Mousqueton I ca nt swim let me stay here	64.78084564208984
And me too monsieur said Blaisois	102.37690734863281
I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqueton	234.90179443359375
And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blaisois	49.19493103027344
Come along I shall strangle you both if you do nt get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the throat	212.41360473632812
Forward Blaisois	90.37922668457031
A groan stifled by the grasp of Porthos was all the reply of poor Blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	32.87890625
Now Mousqueton he said I hope you do nt mean to desert your master	268.12493896484375
Ah sir replied Mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you reenter the army We were all so happy in the Chateau de Pierrefonds	159.98101806640625
And without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois Mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost	238.17864990234375
A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	41.99494934082031
But Porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when Mousqueton rose above the water blind as a newborn puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of Porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	46.40005874633789
In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel	56.213462829589844
Athos was the last to enter	65.61863708496094
Are you all here he asked	37.1572265625
Ah have you your sword Athos cried DArtagnan	146.23182678222656
Cut the cable then	206.5748291015625
Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	57.97502517700195
The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves	245.36129760742188
Come Athos said DArtagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gascon	45.38777542114258
Chapter LXIII	36.28195571899414
Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	144.80630493164062
That you may be sure said the Gascon means something	64.19490814208984
They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it	404.929931640625
Suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light	161.3915252685547
Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers	54.76246643066406
In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	65.60030364990234
The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	44.15129470825195
Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber	78.82791137695312
Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	119.6822280883789
All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck	120.50225830078125
Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Groslow	208.86471557617188
One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance	116.70849609375
The cable is cut he cried no boat	26.76592445373535
How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is impossible	55.526954650878906
Tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides heres the end of the cable	46.06646728515625
What s the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch	70.4746322631836
Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat	58.24296569824219
Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	96.35257720947266
Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons	32.31559753417969
We must pursue them said Groslow they ca nt be gone far and we will sink them passing over them	28.781288146972656
Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted it	70.19465637207031
Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save us	50.694637298583984
Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it	101.01964569091797
The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano	51.63098907470703
A burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened	173.5367889404297
Onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were consumed	435.010986328125
The four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them	15.212512969970703
At one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing	336.5703430175781
Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving ocean	27.928190231323242
They sat silent and dejected	34.59273910522461
By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be over	200.20877075195312
Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	7550.13916015625
All looked around Athos himself stared	99.22383117675781
Tis he it is his voice	30.518075942993164
All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	30.81110191345215
After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously	50.261322021484375
Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions	303.5855712890625
Yes yes I see him well enough said DArtagnan	2.000459671020508
Heagain cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of iron	1669.3504638671875
Oh my God muttered Athos	37.39044952392578
Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to each other	93.919677734375
Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heavens name my strength is failing me I am dying	78.95201110839844
The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Athos	527.4716186523438
Poor fellow he exclaimed	209.16360473632812
Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	262.35882568359375
I believe he s swimming toward us	150.04071044921875
Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos row	96.29144287109375
And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further	28.90415382385254
Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mordaunt	57.11089324951172
Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell	173.79922485351562
Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la Fere	150.0702667236328
Oh pray for mercys sake do nt fly from me	145.65652465820312
For pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble	116.03628540039062
DArtagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor wretch	73.19650268554688
Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence	38.08499526977539
See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his companions	127.69245910644531
Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere	266.5673828125
Gentlemen I am young scarcely twentythree years old	71.84725189208984
I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	213.89254760742188
You would have done what I did	233.48880004882812
Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	85.83448028564453
Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be forgiven	47.13900375366211
Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice	56.64516067504883
Oh this is torture to me cried Athos	14.319255828857422
Mordaunt reappeared	15.935624122619629
For my part said DArtagnan I say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle executioner as you were of King Charles incendiary I recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer Ill stave your wicked head in with this oar	34.57743835449219
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	46.39012908935547
I can not resist doing so he must live	134.38612365722656
Zounds replied DArtagnan why do nt you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch Ah Comte de la Fere you wish to perish by his hands I your son as you call meI will not let you	62.735374450683594
Twas the first time DArtagnan had ever refused a request from Athos	263.1180419921875
Aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	37.928165435791016
If he lays his hand on the boats edge I will cut it off regicide that he is	154.33592224121094
And I said Porthos	390.152587890625
What are you going to do asked Aramis	471.1298522949219
Throw myself in the water and strangle him	272.5360412597656
Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretchs life	284.2002868652344
I will bless youI	407.93890380859375
I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me	49.51026153564453
DArtagnan began to be touched	37.146583557128906
The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos	87.71047973632812
Monsieur the Comte de la Fere he cried I supplicate you pity me I call on youwhere are you I see you no longerI am dyinghelp me help me	70.95841217041016
Here I am sir said Athos leaning and stretching out his arm to Mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here I am take my hand and jump into our boat	96.06997680664062
Mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair	17.27889633178711
That s right said Athos put your other hand here	66.9262924194336
And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers	720.7183227539062
Now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself	55.504032135009766
Ah my mother cried Mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint I can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen	281.45892333984375
And whilst DArtagnan uttered a cry Porthos raised the oar and Aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated Athos into the sea whilst Mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer	66.55381774902344
For an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help Athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk	85.25206756591797
Mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible	18.130443572998047
Porthos was the first who came to himself	55.88214111328125
He tore his hair	65.1347885131836
Oh he cried Athos Athos thou man of noble heart woe is me I have let thee perish	72.3465576171875
At this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated	71.32991790771484
In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams	324.6001892089844
Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt	44.72343063354492
But Athos exclaimed DArtagnan	44.001617431640625
Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat	33.740013122558594
Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy	126.74449157714844
You are not hurt asked DArtagnan	69.94136810302734
No replied Athos and he	74.3794174194336
Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really dead	123.80201721191406
Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	169.51974487304688
At last he sank	89.42665100097656
Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	50.77735137939453
Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in him	90.94868469238281
A capital blow you gave cried Porthos	52.72759246826172
I have a son	116.85919189453125
I wished to live said Athos	271.7887878417969
In short said DArtagnan this has been the will of God	64.108154296875
It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas destiny	92.57780456542969
Chapter LXIV	145.12864685058594
How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten	20.618459701538086
A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described	21.78902244567871
The moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows	348.2803649902344
Porthos was the first to speak	190.00970458984375
I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just witnessed	29.656763076782227
Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel happy	64.75302124023438
I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest	1105.76025390625
I breathe more freely	45.130516052246094
In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs	138.49586486816406
For my part observed Aramis I can not say the same as you do Porthos	51.16546630859375
I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my eyes	13.858864784240723
I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart	32.658103942871094
Oh I feel easy replied Porthos	55.82203674316406
The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body	123.68535614013672
I do not reproach you Athos for what you have done	31.79559898376465
On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike	193.88612365722656
So now I breathe againI am happy	191.8806610107422
Do nt be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed DArtagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	21.54119873046875
Men may subdue menthey can not overcome the elements	592.0494995117188
We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost	49.906105041503906
Mousqueton heaved a deep sigh	247.0478515625
You are ungrateful DArtagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	50.345394134521484
Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulogne	179.88092041015625
Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it	46.56094741821289
Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up	22.123409271240234
But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north	46.60075759887695
That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic	56.88723373413086
Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aramis	153.9731903076172
Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la Fere	61.17942810058594
Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	42.06330871582031
What is the matter what ails you asked Porthos	24.10955238342285
I am cold sir said Mousqueton	54.753196716308594
Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air	1002.2628784179688
Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver	38.00849914550781
How is that Mousqueton	553.7970581054688
Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels	51.46198272705078
What then	106.98008728027344
Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV	39.007266998291016
In these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with	80.34954833984375
The fattest among them cried DArtagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing	129.3010711669922
Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in it	2.000459671020508
However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to you	8239.658203125
Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm	53.06686019897461
And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master	62.46514892578125
Chevalier said DArtagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston could nt you especially after two or three days of fasting	109.83213806152344
Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we have nt known him so long	99.75688171386719
One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not silent	153.9573974609375
Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef	123.8246841430664
Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions	13.705839157104492
This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gayety	75.9884033203125
Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach	73.03437805175781
And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat	21.72554588317871
Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will watch	60.85481643676758
In a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of Athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to France but the benign aspect of protecting Providence	74.42401885986328
After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos	33.04888916015625
Dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save	110.53095245361328
A bark all cried together	59.22160339355469
It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne	327.1961364746094
A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	69.50447845458984
Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native land	25.023387908935547
Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands	57.17258071899414
Zounds I could defy a nation	100.0274658203125
Be quiet Porthos said DArtagnan we are observed	22.64254379272461
We are admired ifaith answered Porthos	143.54869079589844
These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us	105.63465881347656
I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as possible	70.43936157226562
Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its name	168.68727111816406
The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved	50.93313217163086
Here after a short conference they proposed to separate	230.55364990234375
And why separate asked Athos	189.30320739746094
Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I	76.01753997802734
not the same thing by any means	44.84807205200195
In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur dHerblay our crime would be confirmed	682.0370483398438
We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Mazarin	208.3892822265625
You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into	26.811504364013672
Truly Athos interrupted DArtagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of	138.33766174316406
Chevalier he continued addressing Aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion Chevalier Porthos and I run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended Besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from Mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	16.678056716918945
Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach Paris	40.14955139160156
He then gave his friends minute directions as to their route	118.15394592285156
Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart	36.94329071044922
And he gave him his hand	57.13140106201172
Is nt this fox a genius Athos asked the Gascon	42.11375427246094
No he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all	39.25186538696289
Well is all said	35.7165412902832
Then lets count our money and divide it	22.645706176757812
Ah hurrah there s the sun A merry morning to you Sunshine	293.48248291015625
Tis a long time since I saw thee	142.9403839111328
Come come DArtagnan said Athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your eyes	46.19062042236328
Let us be open with each other and sincere	137.41310119628906
What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis	56.74364471435547
No answered Athos embrace me my son	132.49017333984375
Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe I m crying but how foolish all this is	104.31390380859375
Then they embraced	43.709564208984375
At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes repeated	769.2454223632812
At last they lost sight of each other	162.41683959960938
Sacrebleu DArtagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I ca nt keep to myself anything I have against you I have nt been able to recognize you in this matter	342.56964111328125
Why not said DArtagnan with his wise smile	205.10121154785156
Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	33.92109680175781
For my part I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the Mazarins in the world	78.6100082397461
You would be right Porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them	100.59941864013672
Really said Porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	94.0585708618164
Yes no doubt	87.2218017578125
If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Greve	114.71182250976562
Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me DArtagnan	44.71866226196289
Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to Rome	211.91464233398438
But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porthos	50.49156951904297
Because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by Queen Henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by Mazarin because going hence as emissaries to Cromwell we became partisans of King Charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called Mazarin Cromwell Joyce Bridge Fairfax etc	54.18867492675781
we very nearly succeeded in saving it	86.74299621582031
Upon my word that is true said Porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations General Cromwell has had time to think	49.07211685180664
Cromwell thinks of everything Cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	84.30049133300781
We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then	48.1146354675293
The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin	34.50578308105469
Leave that to meI have my plan	50.877037048339844
He laughs best who laughs last	58.95351791381836
Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mordaunt	31.323110580444336
Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mordaunt	122.1905288696289
My faith yes said DArtagnan	49.286651611328125
But we must be going	50.50734329223633
The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm	319.595458984375
Chapter LXXV	92.63733673095703
The Return	108.61820983886719
During the six weeks that Athos and Aramis had been absent from France the Parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of Mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	42.86555480957031
The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone	140.212890625
A deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by Chancellor Seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel Paris would be besieged the very next day	21.18092155456543
This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	87.70036315917969
It wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that Cardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from France within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him	9.449331283569336
Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend it	106.56123352050781
The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Cond and the Duc de Longueville his brotherinlaw	45.53828811645508
This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of Paris	37.344024658203125
As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces	44.11143493652344
The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers	74.09417724609375
On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention	50.19390106201172
They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our king	23.15249252319336
The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses	76.78326416015625
That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of February	47.087684631347656
On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for Paris	39.85563659667969
Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	67.46158599853516
It was against his will that Athos took these precautions but Aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by King Charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of Queen Henrietta	150.3984375
Upon that Athos yielded	87.38011932373047
On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms	56.634925842285156
The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant	33.674442291259766
The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said	203.72344970703125
Who are you gentlemen	11.027017593383789
Two gentlemen	63.727149963378906
And where do you come from	113.93712615966797
From London	73.19981384277344
And what are you going to do in Paris	36.492088317871094
We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of England	58.98095703125
Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of England	121.9052505493164
We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty	74.90243530273438
Where are your passports	127.53740692138672
We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the king	104.0749282836914
Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as spies	95.63841247558594
My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport	84.20125579833984
In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality	81.6759033203125
Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post	218.18276977539062
The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking	56.30219650268555
In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their passports	725.7249145507812
The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other	119.81539154052734
The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background	511.73541259765625
When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	47.4681396484375
Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people	91.37772369384766
There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to enter	107.06485748291016
On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before	104.62260437011719
Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see	134.2161102294922
What asked Athos	334.3856506347656
The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen	13.196876525878906
He looked to mebut tis impossible	67.40824127197266
At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said	180.19796752929688
The passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass	28.99089241027832
The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission	38.98414993286133
Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Athos	33.18146514892578
What is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	34.667724609375
I havedoubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out	2.000459671020508
Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longueville	70.37700653076172
Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin himself	145.8361053466797
The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	58.48497772216797
He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all that	43.13715744018555
Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I have nt the unerring eye of DArtagnan	107.06270599365234
Who is speaking of Monsieur DArtagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room	33.126888275146484
What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet	4.351946830749512
Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed	119.20790100097656
Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in Paris	9.055082321166992
Oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes	149.1988525390625
As thou seest Planchet said Aramis whilst Athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of Mousqueton Bazin and Grimaud	26.933670043945312
And Monsieur dArtagnan of whom you spoke just now Monsieur dHerblay may I ask if you have any news of him	26.01311683654785
We parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached Paris before us	132.1360321044922
No sir I am sure he has nt yet arrived	27.878755569458008
But then he may have stopped at Saint Germain	680.4281005859375
I do nt think so we appointed to meet at La Chevrette	54.93230438232422
I was there this very day	79.2950439453125
And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis smiling	80.91732025146484
No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious	78.10855102539062
In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	69.22291564941406
Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to M	61.65568161010742
Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet bowing	47.579349517822266
Lieutenant asked Aramis	99.51026153564453
Lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain	421.5294189453125
Tis capital and pray how did you acquire all these honors	65.86576080322266
In the first place gentlemen you know that I was the means of Monsieur de Rocheforts escape well I was very near being hung by Mazarin and that made me more popular than ever	143.48573303222656
So owing to your popularity	27.147451400756836
No thanks to something better	55.00202178955078
You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant	11.665338516235352
Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the spot	241.4705047607422
So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you	275.6128234863281
There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I do nt know who for my part	3.224402904510498
And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous voice	40.10346603393555
DArtagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting	47.4681396484375
Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant since	97.2290267944336
Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him	86.48384857177734
None sir	76.92185974121094
And he lives	47.1053352355957
Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlemagne	102.01507568359375
And passes his time	41.15766143798828
Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevreuse	484.8226013183594
He and the Count de Guiche are like each others shadows	232.9512176513672
Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the lieutenant	69.77810668945312
Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the counts fingers	43.44248580932617
Well what are you doing countto a former lackey	86.80386352539062
My friend said Athos he has given me news of Raoul	33.37010192871094
And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do	56.065345764160156
Reenter Paris if you will let us my good Planchet	79.99637603759766
Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your servant	31.634963989257812
Then turning to his men	70.2386474609375
Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beaufort	133.97096252441406
Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentinels	81.60474395751953
The sergeant drew near to Planchet	4441.58935546875
What without passports he murmured	54.513145446777344
Without passports said Planchet	41.90102767944336
Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen	64.15350341796875
And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for them	38.45466613769531
As he said this he pressed Grimauds hand who seemed honored by the distinction	20.982938766479492
Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it	43.92878723144531
Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your service	20.99519157409668
That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his horse	73.15870666503906
How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats	71.8486557006836
Chapter LXXVI	144.60118103027344
The Ambassadors	8.704424858093262
The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital	10.959798812866211
The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Louvre	23.40679359436035
Night had closed in and Paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferryboats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to postParis presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of Aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	68.15513610839844
They reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from England	110.37547302246094
We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from there	81.56471252441406
What then are your names gentlemen	96.70289611816406
The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay said Aramis	141.60243225097656
Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment	99.1213607788086
Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aramis	16.809030532836914
On arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door	12.541853904724121
Madame he said I hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen I have come to announce are the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay	24.614038467407227
On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	97.53778076171875
Poor queen murmured Athos	47.97871780395508
Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door	29.439247131347656
The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter	41.82384490966797
Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself	141.2762908935547
The queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the Duc de Chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of Madame de Longueville on the Place Royale	15.941391944885254
All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	66.17694854736328
Well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends But the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de Chatillon who bring me from Her Majesty the Queen Anne of Austria the very latest intelligence	158.68275451660156
Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	107.18586730957031
Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chatillon	43.3856201171875
You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects	67.50164794921875
Yes madame Chatillon stammered out	47.82814407348633
Athos and Aramis were more and more astonished	76.21487426757812
And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people	66.79671478271484
Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	76.20539093017578
The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	95.42645263671875
Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Athos	112.54750061035156
One moment yes answered the queen	269.00140380859375
One momentI begfor here are the Chevalier dHerblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister	21.178735733032227
Speak gentlemen speakI am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	145.75704956054688
Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me	112.23495483398438
Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	64.11873626708984
Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness	161.61940002441406
Speak sir I beg you to do so	96.79875946044922
I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken	76.75259399414062
Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then	111.45401763916016
Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen	32.63474655151367
I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of falsehood	9.744902610778809
With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating voice	12.94508171081543
Yes murmured Flamarens lowering his eyes	36.50913619995117
Athos sighed deeply	22.962398529052734
Or rather sir said Aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman	22.793869018554688
Chatillon and Flamarens started	66.81902313232422
Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment	34.661376953125
On your brow I read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands tremble	132.2372589111328
Oh my God my God what has happened	74.66779327392578
Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us	43.55809020996094
Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen	164.23867797851562
Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him	165.32379150390625
Sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the Comte de la Fere and myself what we ought to say here	88.13871765136719
During this brief altercation Athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said	89.61874389648438
Madame princeswho by nature are above other menreceive from Heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes	86.82965850830078
We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition	82.78587341308594
Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission	72.42594909667969
Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles I	54.142478942871094
before his death had placed in the hands of Aramis	87.7070083618164
Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with them	21.82600212097168
He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish	169.12001037597656
The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter	1126.808837890625
Athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around	204.0726776123047
I the Comte de la Fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before God and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of England was done whilst we were on English ground	69.70817565917969
Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us go	67.8289794921875
Our duty is fulfilled	245.68313598632812
Not yet	116.05316162109375
said Aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen	63.38719940185547
And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I can not say before the queen	120.985595703125
Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor	80.62837219238281
Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	137.03366088867188
That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar	91.65277862548828
Sir cried De Chatillon	84.57073211669922
What have you done with Monsieur de Bruy Has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of Monsieur de Mazarin There is an abundance of Italian masks at the Palais Royal from harlequin even to pantaloon	29.197311401367188
Chevalier chevalier said Athos	109.37435913085938
Leave me alone said Aramis impatiently	82.38577270507812
You know well that I do nt like to leave things half finished	64.14573669433594
Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aramis	37.269508361816406
Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in Parisbut we are contented with another course	16.616321563720703
Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace	93.1828842163086
One moment gentlemen cried Flamarens	94.40977478027344
I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it	110.4563980102539
And why not said Aramis in his tone of raillery	78.77989196777344
Is it Mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent	472.9446716308594
Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chatillon	29.33174705505371
Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor	89.56999969482422
That is my opinion said Aramis	12.946242332458496
You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my opinion	11.958903312683105
Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	47.87852478027344
Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	143.28834533691406
Willingly replied De Chatillon	76.75394439697266
Duke said Flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen	11.925785064697266
Until tomorrow evening you are not at your own disposal	39.128013610839844
Let it be then the day after tomorrow said Aramis	52.988548278808594
Tomorrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charenton	150.7250213623047
How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the world	59.076324462890625
Very well tomorrow sir	72.84947967529297
I shall rely on it	73.62812042236328
Are you going to rejoin your cardinal Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return	51.440738677978516
Why not	155.0992889404297
Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen	96.85065460205078
Then let us draw on the spot	42.75996780395508
It is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows expedition	150.6735076904297
Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each other	64.24905395507812
There was such irony in the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from Flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying	56.7408332824707
You promise sirthats agreedthat I shall find you tomorrow at Charenton	119.11528778076172
Oh do nt be afraid sir replied Aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the Louvre	29.245418548583984
For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Athos	96.49138641357422
What have they done to you	44.221717834472656
Theydid you not see what they did	35.83000564575195
They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in England	24.179874420166016
Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	358.8209228515625
However I m glad not to fight them until tomorrow	290.7351989746094
I hope we shall have something better to do tonight than to draw the sword	43.378726959228516
What have we to do	37.99182891845703
Egad to take Mazarin	124.83025360107422
Athos curled his lip with disdain	83.921875
These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aramis	97.13722229003906
Because it is taking people unawares	17.27889633178711
Really Athos you would make a singular general	1166.5631103515625
You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness	380.3540344238281
Athos smiled	141.29319763183594
You know one can not change his nature he said	92.86971282958984
Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarins arrest would nt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage	55.27633285522461
Say at once you disapprove of my proposal	48.61322784423828
I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in France	146.2076416015625
I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	106.85553741455078
Come come	88.8895263671875
Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about this	32.501678466796875
Yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadjutor	61.786415100097656
He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours	46.01261520385742
It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Raoul	59.87938690185547
They reentered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud	99.14678955078125
But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne	397.35211181640625
He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received it	212.5749969482422
Chapter LXXVII	224.18910217285156
The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo	40.236263275146484
The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege	125.95252990722656
Athos and Aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements	2.000459671020508
On arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	45.540740966796875
On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still	98.70931243896484
Oh cried Aramis do you see count	131.64744567871094
Yes said Athos	91.3431396484375
Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be	63.11897277832031
What do you think Aramis	25.194091796875
Why they are our men	151.53472900390625
You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamarens	20.60169219970703
And I Monsieur de Chatillon	48.30351638793945
As to the cavalier in the brown cloak	31.621253967285156
It is the cardinal	1293.668701171875
In person	110.49263763427734
How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon	232.01490783691406
Athos smiled but did not reply	205.53147888183594
Five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	67.55561828613281
This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contis lieutenant	168.16893005371094
Monsieur de Bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last monththat is since Paris had been besiegedhe was ready to receive the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay	88.78002166748047
He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war	54.48677062988281
Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	42.81513595581055
Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed	64.15855407714844
Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people	60.717308044433594
But I as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout	343.6192932128906
My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your health	337.8446044921875
Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but indifferent	30.78145408630371
But you come from England	2.9005866050720215
And King Charles is well as I have just heard	233.4555206298828
He is dead my lord said Aramis	491.38970947265625
Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	45.76041030883789
Dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament	84.71566772460938
And executed in our presence	41.3664665222168
What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me	140.05467224121094
Monsieur de Flamarens	9.095902442932129
Yes he has just gone out	12.144241333007812
Athos smiled	9.27568531036377
With two companions he said	69.53199005126953
With two companions yes replied the duke	52.605655670166016
Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them	188.0415496826172
Why yes I think soin the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise	29.06258773803711
The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at ease	67.58625793457031
My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain	47.467498779296875
One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice ones comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted	54.78108596801758
My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout oercrows me	206.275390625
I confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother De Turenne were reinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might	173.38328552246094
You are perfectly right my lord	267.2252197265625
You think so At this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto I have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that I am wrong in doing so I ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the Duc de Chatillon just now	50.162845611572266
Accept it my lord accept it said Aramis	121.10893249511719
Faith yes	78.81757354736328
I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see	61.64398193359375
The two friends saluted the duke	105.62952423095703
Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	52.49052810668945
Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him	109.83622741699219
Oh as to that said Aramis we are witnesses	48.78351974487305
Mazarin especially	53.15206527709961
Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly estimated	48.7805290222168
Oh the devil take this gout	286.8461608886719
Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	66.66244506835938
When they reached the street Aramis said	87.989013671875
Well Athos what do you think	148.4573974609375
Of whom	30.72692108154297
Pardieu of Monsieur de Bouillon	485.2287292480469
My friend I think that he is much troubled with gout	210.8084259033203
You noticed that I did nt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit	175.22634887695312
You did well you would have caused him an access of his disease	104.41000366210938
Let us go to Monsieur de Beaufort	396.1137390136719
The two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome	47.95200729370117
It was ten oclock when they arrived	156.9798583984375
The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance	50.61341857910156
There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled	90.00147247314453
Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to them	80.41033172607422
Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings	103.55223846435547
We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting tomorrow	57.48147201538086
Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it	131.44139099121094
I hope that is true said Aramis	72.20797729492188
As for me I am sure of it said the duke	46.01962661743164
De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dismounted	54.01801681518555
Hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	156.60336303710938
Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier dHerblay How does it happen that you are in Paris	171.92092895507812
Rochefort cried the two friends	38.835079193115234
Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to do	105.95924377441406
You are still with us I presume	88.25176239013672
More than ever	21.01884651184082
And the duke	104.8958511352539
Furious against the cardinal	45.69176483154297
You know his successour dear duke He is really king of Paris he ca nt go out without being mobbed by his admirers	48.76288986206055
Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness	48.54771423339844
I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked on	21.81688690185547
Every door was opened to him	78.23155212402344
Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	10.349617958068848
Ah he cried by Jove you re welcome sirs	20.9838809967041
You are coming to sup with me are you not Boisgoli tell Noirmont that I have two guests	83.76332092285156
You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of	58.46565628051758
Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Ramee	36.446285247802734
Thank God we do nt want either rope ladders or gagpears now	28.319225311279297
My lord said Athos do not let us disturb you	241.1087646484375
We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders	198.76824951171875
As to my health since it has stood five years of prison with Monsieur de Chavigny to boot tis excellent As to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party I shall end if this goes on by giving none at all	183.60028076171875
In short my lord said Athos glancing at Aramis your highness is discontented with your party	37.04736328125
Discontented sir say my highness is furious To such a degree I assure you though I would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before I should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in France than the Cardinal Mazarin	41.31519317626953
At this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there	179.85467529296875
My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordships service and his most faithful servants	62.601112365722656
My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it	97.9369888305664
And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesDArtagnan and Porthos	48.197269439697266
DArtagnan and Porthos	119.54767608642578
Ah yes	56.642704010009766
You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier dHerblay that I am altogether and always at your service	48.6378059387207
Athos and Aramis bowed and went out	21.04037094116211
My dear Athos cried Aramis I think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lessonGod forgive me	56.023948669433594
Wait a little Aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor	76.65420532226562
Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aramis	106.21834564208984
They directed their horses to the city	95.2656021118164
On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	96.64591217041016
The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in Paris but in Venice	97.64997863769531
Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches	22.321983337402344
The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn	52.90717697143555
The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows	83.71648406982422
Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting	257.3784484863281
Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his antechamber	161.6442108154297
My dear friend we must take people as we find them	86.4730453491211
The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a court	26.224618911743164
Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of France	472.39093017578125
Let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left hand	6.359898567199707
Exactly so cried Aramis	157.8182830810547
Ah if I m not mistaken heres Bazin	104.67295837402344
Come here fellow	135.5207061767578
Bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	67.6368408203125
A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste	160.83078002929688
Certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bruy	113.85435485839844
De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it up	37.15646743774414
And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments	2.000459671020508
Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin	99.35753631591797
You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis replied	38.75061798095703
What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all Europe	60.192317962646484
In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles I	169.446044921875
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold	85.2769546508789
The two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone	60.018375396728516
At ten oclock the next day they met again	48.515132904052734
Athos had been out since six oclock	558.897705078125
Well have you any news Athos asked	32.15083694458008
No one has seen DArtagnan and Porthos has not appeared	83.47264862060547
Have you anything	39.105125427246094
The devil said Aramis	88.25558471679688
In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did	359.7410888671875
Add to that DArtagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him	51.902774810791016
He expected you will remember to be here on the fifth	93.2130126953125
And here we are at the ninth	84.33084869384766
This evening the margin of possible delay expires	25.1512508392334
What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them tonight	68.84727478027344
Pardieu we must go and look for them	122.78617095947266
All right said Athos	47.636253356933594
But Raoul said Aramis	162.89141845703125
A light cloud passed over the counts face	101.95350646972656
Raoul gives me much uneasiness he said	52.179386138916016
He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Cond he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not returned	150.34889221191406
Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse	103.54911804199219
She was not at home	327.15618896484375
And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longueville	170.5500946044922
I did go there	139.2364959716797
She was no longer there but she had left her new address	9.631996154785156
Where was she	236.3837432861328
Guess I give you a thousand chances	47.799530029296875
How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her	93.90866088867188
At the Hotel de Ville my dear fellow	208.019287109375
What at the Hotel de Ville Has she then been appointed provost of merchants	50.7711067199707
No but she has become queen of Paris ad interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the Tuileries she is installed at the Hotel de Ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke	100.4078140258789
You did nt tell me of that Aramis	538.8836669921875
Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon me	603.4989624023438
Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to me	50.8118782043457
You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom I ve hated for a long time there	111.9501724243164
Why have you hated him	118.15597534179688
Because he is the brother of Coligny	191.3536376953125
Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy you	84.07733154296875
Yes but it does not I am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a churchman	278.7482604980469
Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me	116.60903930664062
Come now said Athos you are joking	72.23766326904297
In that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats I observed cannon on the road I saw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton as the Duc de Chatillon said	82.61945343017578
I supposed said Athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements	35.380123138427734
No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences	77.94855499267578
Poor creatures said Athos who are going to be killed in order that Monsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal	107.62626647949219
Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this affair	791.8399658203125
Perhaps you speak the truth Aramis	52.50705337524414
Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with DArtagnan Porthos and possibly even Raoul	49.85993957519531
Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captainsee he has the true military style	68.23627471923828
What ho said Grimaud	8.644962310791016
What asked Athos	298.80438232421875
Planchet sir	156.53182983398438
Lieutenant yesterday said Aramis captain today colonel doubtless tomorrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of France	66.06758117675781
Question him about the fight said Athos	28.814369201660156
Planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place Royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of Paris and to march on Charenton when necessary	39.58686065673828
This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike tone	36.68275833129883
No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the enemy	58.893585205078125
Sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	51.759727478027344
Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos	312.3192138671875
I do nt care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he said	348.04248046875
Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going on	103.32627868652344
And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for you	82.48416137695312
Come then my friend we will go forward	131.556884765625
Have nt you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account	31.83344268798828
My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary	33.168983459472656
And how long ago was that	168.84507751464844
When I last drew my poniard	14.380131721496582
Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt	99.07674407958984
Well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow	84.96790313720703
Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordauntit will bring bad luck	98.80085754394531
And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aramis	17.679176330566406
Chapter LXXVIII	4.850485324859619
The Battle of Charenton	78.71473693847656
As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle	36.47526550292969
Ah my friend cried Athos suddenly where have you brought us I fancy I perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers	91.68901062011719
Goodday sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything	149.2819061279297
There is now a truce and a conference	197.06932067871094
The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public affairs	29.578338623046875
Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again	50.981422424316406
Sir said Aramis you speak to the point	113.0833969116211
Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries	41.36358642578125
At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of Paris	227.87469482421875
And was this conference arranged beforehand	36.38529968261719
No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians	107.06403350830078
Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them	109.10948181152344
And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to	126.2982177734375
To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charenton	25.7033634185791
I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs	48.95264434814453
Yes almost said Aramis	58.193138122558594
We are for the king and the princes added Athos	244.01683044433594
We must understand each other said the duke	57.93890380859375
The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Cond although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs	44.70616912841797
Yes answered Athos but his right place is in our ranks with the Prince de Conti De Beaufort DElbeuf and De Bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken offare you going to try to take Charenton	39.63301467895508
Such are my orders	64.5711441040039
Sir since you command the cavalry	42.07237243652344
Pardon me I am commanderinchief	443.98358154296875
So much the better	192.88966369628906
You must know all your officersI mean those more distinguished	163.84803771972656
Why yes very nearly	42.30263900756836
Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the Chevalier dArtagnan lieutenant in the musketeers	85.69105529785156
No sir he is not with us he left Paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to England	169.79000854492188
I knew that but I supposed he had returned	130.0614013671875
No sir no one has seen him	9.631996154785156
I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur dArtagnan still holds his place	184.4510955810547
The two friends looked at each other	180.67909240722656
You see said Athos	268.11968994140625
It is strange said Aramis	41.16738510131836
It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way	95.69511413574219
If we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start	163.34176635742188
Athos nodded affirmatively then turning	25.951993942260742
And Monsieur de Bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the Prince de Condhas he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings	66.0620346069336
Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte	27.7663631439209
Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if possible	62.022911071777344
Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to headquarters	212.2774200439453
Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us	153.70323181152344
A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chatillon	49.9478759765625
I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat	28.490766525268555
And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers	155.24905395507812
They are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them	83.95882415771484
They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going on	208.13259887695312
In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his sword	60.59967041015625
On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to him	155.7808837890625
Gentlemen cried Chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into Charenton for I shall begin in a short timetheres a signal from the prince	31.312463760375977
The cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	68.34040069580078
Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gallop	41.17095947265625
Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beaufort	43.77952575683594
As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc dElbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	88.40603637695312
Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead	41.19838333129883
Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching	27.947933197021484
Let us save them half of their journey	63.29731369018555
And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight	51.15557098388672
Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie	2.000459671020508
The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor	49.861629486083984
His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom	100.09942626953125
Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in person	202.54107666015625
This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost surrounded	114.81305694580078
He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded	100.41441345214844
De Chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment	871.7340698242188
Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fugitives	229.02610778808594
Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands Athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddlebags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	41.78034973144531
Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	233.951416015625
His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again	68.61831665039062
On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front	266.449462890625
The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted skill	302.900146484375
Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to youI expected you	158.20118713378906
I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I am	72.94441223144531
Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddlebags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man	40.92862319946289
Thank God sir they are not	90.51805877685547
And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis fired	152.48121643066406
But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him	149.70140075683594
Oh you ve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss you	327.6876525878906
If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	117.72592163085938
Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was fired	79.86264038085938
De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse	54.297786712646484
The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	108.83979797363281
I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground	2773.71337890625
I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my word	58.49942398071289
Can I be of any use to you	7.467653274536133
Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	125.98724365234375
He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul	51.44012451171875
Raoul cried Athos	7.47255802154541
The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier dHerblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his sword	120.61699676513672
My prisoner he cried	88.34463500976562
Athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee	41.00733184814453
At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero	102.87061309814453
On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered Charenton flying	67.39859771728516
The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aramis	52.24497604370117
Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped him	41.89302444458008
On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Frondeurs	566.6307373046875
It is a matter of indifference to me said Aramis I came here only to meet De Chatillon I have met him I am contented tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel	3230.58837890625
And besides we have a prisoner said Athos pointing to Raoul	31.29891014099121
The three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop	86.24675750732422
What were you doing in the battle my friend inquired Athos of the youth twas not your right place I think as you were not equipped for an engagement	98.61470031738281
I had no intention of fighting today sir I was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil when seeing Monsieur de Chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side	42.738014221191406
It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la Fere	46.63352966308594
What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier	46.55010223388672
I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger	356.37811279296875
Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy	26.583776473999023
Then you were going to Rueil	62.32218933105469
Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his eminence	69.66643524169922
You must still deliver it said Athos	66.73970031738281
No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch	47.993385314941406
This young man must not however fail in his duty said Athos	119.45006561279297
In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget that	42.678863525390625
What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means	27.250959396362305
Give me the despatch Raoul	133.02731323242188
The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	39.49898910522461
Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevaliers prisoner	46.59407043457031
Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read it	81.60708618164062
You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see	223.8154754638672
Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about DArtagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it	41.66254806518555
My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you demand	46.61589431762695
They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of	57.27386474609375
Oh cried Athos	128.62567138671875
Well said Aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides Commingess troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to DArtagnan and Porthos	385.4761047363281
Well search Paris all day long said Athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to Picardy and I feel no doubt that thanks to DArtagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts	40.061859130859375
Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former master	133.8934326171875
That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been killed	45.50796127319336
All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred	78.41814422607422
It was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the Place Royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at Charenton in the thickest of the fighting	37.207332611083984
Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet but he had seen nothing of DArtagnan they wished to take Planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five oclock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII	80.81409454345703
Chapter LXXIX	197.84524536132812
The Road to Picardy	77.89159393310547
On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger	15.422757148742676
Besides they felt that the dnouement of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	65.9915771484375
Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris itself	4.629002094268799
Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	46.90407180786133
In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at	62.67330551147461
Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton	96.01071166992188
They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction	139.02426147460938
Parisians and Frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemys camp but what was their surprise after passing Saint Denis to hear that at Saint Germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives	97.62083435058594
The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France and also to escape the Frondeurs who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes	16.0720157623291
Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	71.29563903808594
Nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	27.021961212158203
Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers	63.847991943359375
He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife	37.07899856567383
2d February	145.74302673339844
This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on	66.89266204833984
They rode forward and reached Abbeville	193.362548828125
There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed	2.000459671020508
Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbeville	149.944091796875
If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him	436.5636291503906
But DArtagnan is devoid of such weaknesses	109.46540832519531
Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else	66.05239868164062
They continued their route	272.7452392578125
It had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces	382.7206115722656
They proceeded thus to Peronne	390.6263732910156
Athos began to despair	46.710914611816406
His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them	73.80784606933594
They had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends	64.19356536865234
They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries	87.94203186035156
They were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart Athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words They are following us	132.7935028076172
Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was DArtagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping	299.4777526855469
Aramis shook his head	1355.7305908203125
Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of	68.5998306274414
You are right Aramis let us travel on	122.480224609375
To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	179.0323028564453
Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis	320.6181335449219
They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	168.42596435546875
All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone	77.3859634399414
It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	195.23394775390625
Aramis stopped	80.1938705444336
Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porthos	51.18865966796875
Let us get down count and examine this rock	49.085716247558594
They both alighted	232.02101135253906
The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside	100.30325317382812
With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over	269.7424011230469
Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words	108.66877746582031
Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us	167.36376953125
If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peacock	32.5888557434082
It is kept by a friend of ours	97.8077163696289
At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peacock	95.08832550048828
Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwinded	111.93789672851562
Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	150.64842224121094
The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them	291.1291809082031
In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock	69.5940170288086
The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chinaman	169.5319366455078
They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier	69.20752716064453
Do you know that he asked	110.09446716308594
Athos merely glanced at it	55.19907760620117
Tis DArtagnans sword he said	169.3317413330078
Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host	463.260009765625
To the smaller	182.947021484375
I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen	120.74929809570312
Well what has happened to them	85.22224426269531
They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate	111.27999877929688
Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and DArtagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men	119.63760375976562
The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers	140.29000854492188
Arrested were they inquired Athos is it known why	87.13114166259766
No sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone I found this broken swordblade as I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones	19.16470718383789
Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aramis	117.23715209960938
Where were they taken asked Athos	47.054779052734375
Toward the town of Louvres was the reply	91.35468292236328
The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louvres	59.65268325805664
Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	40.607383728027344
Let us alight here said Athos	65.66007995605469
DArtagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself	217.6815643310547
They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before them	1798.4490966796875
The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rueil	118.70963287353516
They went to Rueil cried Aramis	162.6583251953125
Let us go to Rueil said Athos	119.42853546142578
It is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said Aramis	122.4809799194336
Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of DArtagnan I should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same Aramis	141.21128845214844
Certainlybut you make me out better than I am dear count	244.36044311523438
Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution	75.993408203125
But where you go I go	98.72470092773438
They then set off for Rueil	38.785972595214844
Here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested	97.86141204833984
Rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the Parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even Frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people	133.33111572265625
The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them	31.96672248840332
They expected to hear some mention made of DArtagnan or of Porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms	120.46290588378906
It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the minister	111.70599365234375
My friend said Aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	627.8700561523438
If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out	1042.1790771484375
Let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	56.80561447143555
Arrested at Compiegne they have been carried to Rueil at Rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to Saint Germain	132.8040771484375
As to the Bastile they are not there though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs	365.9809265136719
They are not dead for the death of DArtagnan would make a sensation	172071.9375
As for Porthos I believe him to be eternal like God although less patient	2.000459671020508
Do not let us despond but wait at Rueil for my conviction is that they are at Rueil	54.211585998535156
But what ails you You are pale	71.7514877319336
It is this answered Athos with a trembling voice	41.925201416015625
I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed	264.4232177734375
Oh never fear said Aramis	75.24423217773438
Richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position	131.13906860351562
He could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	191.81863403320312
But Mazarin is a lowborn rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer	40.02187728881836
Be calmfor I am sure that DArtagnan and Porthos are at Rueil alive and well	50.76640701293945
But resumed Athos I recur to my first proposal	80.2313232421875
I know no better means than to act with candor	41.247623443603516
I shall seek not Mazarin but the queen and say to her Madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends	47.01580810546875
Aramis shook his head	43.142032623291016
Tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches	34.081600189208984
They continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted DArtagnan to Rueil	85.25032043457031
Athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen	50.945457458496094
In order to see the queen said Aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinalremember what I tell you Athoswe shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish	39.66633605957031
Now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me I confess	43.93442153930664
Let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly	274.6066589355469
I shall go he said to the queen	65.78340148925781
Well then answered Aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that I may take that opportunity of going to Paris	209.27195739746094
To whom	54.3316764831543
Zounds how do I know perhaps to Madame de Longueville	149.52975463867188
She is allpowerful yonder she will help me	91.69115447998047
But send me word should you be arrested for then I will return directly	111.9295654296875
Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me	76.46958923339844
No I thank you	106.33013916015625
Should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not I am not sure be twentyfour hours in prison without getting free	27.710092544555664
My friend since I killed Chatillon adored of the ladies of Saint Germain I am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	109.826904296875
The queen is likely to follow Mazarins counsels and to have me tried	85.6040267944336
Do you think she loves this Italian so much as they say she does	78.02080535888672
Did she not love an Englishman	26.319169998168945
My friend she is a woman	8.335732460021973
No no you are deceivedshe is a queen	21.56635856628418
Dear friend I shall sacrifice myself and go and see Anne of Austria	45.317996978759766
Adieu Athos I am going to raise an army	95.43218231201172
For what purpose	77.19461822509766
To come back and besiege Rueil	62.13465881347656
Where shall we meet again	63.980899810791016
At the foot of the cardinals gallows	99.26789855957031
The two friends departedAramis to return to Paris Athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen	64.34175872802734
Chapter LXXX	55.88523483276367
The Gratitude of Anne of Austria	103.99724578857422
Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of Anne of Austria	67.16728210449219
It was granted and was to take place after her mornings levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present	49.99417495727539
A vast crowd filled the apartments of Saint Germain	173.64068603515625
Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the Prince de Conti the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of France	104.37356567382812
The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court	64.56060791015625
The particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance	40.32542419433594
The court made songs on the Parisians and the Parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	252.5115509033203
In the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless peoples minds were uneasy	69.18836212158203
Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there Every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	39.86893081665039
He felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do	109.55418395996094
Cond himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him	33.96466064453125
The queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	83.609375
When the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from Paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them	49.917625427246094
All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friendspoor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	83.57998657226562
But Athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	99.73347473144531
He insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti or Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur de Bouillon or Monsieur dElbeuf or the coadjutor or Madame de Longueville or Broussel or the Parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance	174.11285400390625
The conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet	20.83415412902832
Athos was introduced and announced by name	27.98050880432129
It was a name that too often resounded in her majestys ears and too often vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth	105.18460845947266
It is then a service which you propose to render us count asked Anne of Austria after a moments silence	80.67740631103516
Yes madame another service said Athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him	78.26890563964844
Athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier	145.0687255859375
Anne frowned	33.279083251953125
Mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up	176.60841369628906
Speak said the queen	54.46868896484375
Mazarin turned again to his papers	77.86964416503906
Madame resumed Athos two of my friends named DArtagnan and Monsieur du Vallon sent to England by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of France no one knows what has become of them	232.03028869628906
Well said the queen	76.95781707763672
I address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that I may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice	406.3987121582031
Sir replied Anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police Well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at Paris	61.64456558227539
I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections	106.72350311279297
But God forgive me cried Anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her I believe that you are yourself interrogating	3.923752546310425
Yes madame here I have a right to do so for it concerns Monsieur dArtagnandArtagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	40.40668869018555
The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of Anne	108.69664764404297
Sir he said I can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty	279.4233703613281
These individuals are under arrest	41.63815689086914
They disobeyed orders	181.796875
I beg of your majesty then said Athos calmly and not replying to Mazarin to quash these arrests of Messieurs dArtagnan and du Vallon	222.98033142089844
What you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen	449.19610595703125
Monsieur dArtagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said Athos bowing with great dignity	2.000459671020508
He was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him	108.64856719970703
You too have been in England sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order	94.62019348144531
I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I	70.33990478515625
Poor king culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	27.542407989501953
This is the second time that Monsieur dArtagnan has been in England	150.98570251464844
He went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king	91.38300323486328
Sir said Anne to Mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen	152.5034637451172
I wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases	167.52239990234375
Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests that is your name is it not sir	107.78202819824219
I have another name madameI am called Athos	211.17454528808594
Madame said Mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled	53.16218948364258
You hear sir said the queen	110.22216796875
Yes madame I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	44.984405517578125
May I not go and see my friends	264.87384033203125
Yes sir you shall see them	14.937614440917969
But apropos you belong to the Fronde do you not	130.22406005859375
Madame I serve the king	63.665367126464844
Yes in your own way	175.96417236328125
My way is the way of all gentlemen and I know only one way answered Athos haughtily	360.2691345214844
Go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know	339.4712219238281
Scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to Mazarin	358.4098205566406
Cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court	61.38154983520508
Your majesty answered Mazarin desires me to do only what I was going to ask you to let me do	17.053674697875977
These bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third	83.27828216552734
Athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicionabove all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	89.41964721679688
He waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them	106.72441864013672
He walked to the window and looked into the court	174.90078735351562
He saw the deputation from the Parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen	25.60271644592285
A very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	47.3531608581543
Athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder	264.2490234375
Ah Monsieur de Comminges he said	88.29519653320312
Yes count and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to accept my excuses	168.8818817138672
What is it	26.142837524414062
Be so good as to give me up your sword count	214.80374145507812
Athos smiled and opened the window	17.722909927368164
Aramis he cried	80.55266571044922
A gentleman turned around	73.95073699951172
Athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	117.07475280761719
It was Aramis	137.70440673828125
He bowed with great friendship to the count	125.91397857666016
Aramis cried Athos I am arrested	146.9388427734375
Good replied Aramis calmly	175.01316833496094
Sir said Athos turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison	16.494361877441406
I prize itit was given to my ancestor by King Francis I	56.13462829589844
In his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	66.83211517333984
Now whither do you conduct me	55.29652404785156
Into my room first replied Comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile	129.54754638671875
Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word	61.62258529663086
Chapter LXXXI	300.3441162109375
Cardinal Mazarin as King	305.1138610839844
The arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events	241.9829559326172
To the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	82.72754669189453
Accordingly it was admitted to the presence of Anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them	138.64566040039062
On the other hand Mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded	57.881385803222656
It was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	29.999357223510742
The discourse being finished the queen remained silent	87.64852142333984
Gentlemen said Mazarin I join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	67.50901794433594
I have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the French	85.19705200195312
Alas I have never been understood and no wonder	96.68851470947266
I succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of France	6.462138652801514
The memory of Richelieu annihilates me	158.23362731933594
In vainwere I an ambitious manshould I struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you	69.4891357421875
I own myself conquered	98.53314971923828
I shall obey the wishes of the people	61.309532165527344
If Paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed Paris has been sufficiently punished enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice	49.57988357543945
Tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom	101.8055419921875
Since you demand my resignation I retire	94.80879974365234
Then said Aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	114.92781066894531
There is nothing to do but to send Monsieur Mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into France	81.0495376586914
One instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont how fast you go one may soon see that you re a soldier	169.65664672851562
There s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights	164.80862426757812
Chancellor said the queen turning to Seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences	115.62210845947266
They can take place at Rueil	44.166263580322266
The cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore I will not speak more fully now	433.6670837402344
As to his going or staying I feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do	11.31670093536377
A transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety	46.53577423095703
Her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts	68.03684997558594
But added the queen in awaiting the cardinals decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only	88.63029479980469
The deputies bowed and left the room	30.014467239379883
What exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates	5.477832794189453
To promote your majestys welfare madame replied Mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that I would not make	25.28997802734375
Anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	67.54105377197266
A recollection of Athos came into her mind	19.65561866760254
His fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of Buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king	84.53424072265625
Mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds passreflections like thoughts of the heavens	69.89362335205078
Must we then asked Anne of Austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times	59.96513366699219
Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	546.7743530273438
Annes head was bent downshe had not seen the Italians smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up	125.42481994628906
Well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it	100.23612976074219
I am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the Duke of Buckinghamto him whom you allowed to be assassinatedto the Duchess de Chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiledto the Duc de Beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which I stand to you	22.315582275390625
Anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride	13.472140312194824
She blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them	11.634986877441406
That man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution	15.715147972106934
You know something about him do you not madame I shall tell him therefore and in doing so I shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me	476.3699951171875
What is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection	179.95530700683594
An abdication repeated Anne I thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated	108.23680114746094
Well replied Mazarin and am I not almost a kingking indeed of France Thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings	31.19907569885254
This was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame	128.05445861816406
Queen Elizabeth and Catherine II	2955.570556640625
of Russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers	234.01499938964844
Anne of Austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	182.27220153808594
Sir she replied did I not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased	79.78164672851562
In that case said Mazarin I think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety	102.04412078857422
Remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted	107.09355163574219
You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them Patience They have selected a field of battle on which I am an abler general than theythat of a conference	63.468345642089844
No we shall beat them by merely temporizing	58.77741241455078
They want food already	49.019287109375
They will be ten times worse off in a week	388.3747863769531
Ah yes Good heavens I know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but	12728.06640625
I understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	76.06848907470703
However we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient	89.25151824951172
One only is still not in our power and braves us	62.89289474487305
But devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	37.93385314941406
We have accomplished more difficult things than that	49.68482208251953
In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones	208.26412963867188
Today the third will be there also	215.92884826660156
As long as they are in prison all will be well said Anne but one of these days they will get out	222.20433044433594
Yes if your majesty releases them	44.36191177368164
Ah exclaimed Anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets Paris	54.89815902709961
Why so	166.65643310546875
On account of the Bastile sir which is so strong and so secure	43.65996170043945
Madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain Paris with Paris the Bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein	56.95025634765625
Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	117.8633041381836
Mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away	19.223987579345703
Anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	31.392356872558594
I once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said I shall do but I have done so and so	28.514585494995117
That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil darker and more silent even than the Bastile	168.21994018554688
Degenerate world	49.90617752075195
Chapter LXXXII	41.51533889770508
After quitting Anne Mazarin took the road to Rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	59.008304595947266
In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	26.512500762939453
In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chatou	14.067404747009277
The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure	82.60030364990234
Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in silence	33.018638610839844
Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened	50.35719680786133
Grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athoss imminent death was likely to make him uneasy	112.592529296875
At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned back	141.42193603515625
Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue	315.5085144042969
Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	20.247133255004883
The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head	107958.4140625
Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached him	189.5009002685547
My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged	246.99697875976562
In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is	93.20620727539062
I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen	64.77315521240234
My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur dArtagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery	41.714561462402344
Mazarin thought for an instant	51.904605865478516
Comminges saw that he was undecided	136.01296997070312
Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fronde	309.7024230957031
If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality	34.75983810424805
Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that smile	50.26751708984375
You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hearsay	97.1705322265625
I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us	101.04652404785156
But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison	26.358455657958984
In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison	103.28258514404297
Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comminges	23.432769775390625
These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors	84.74075317382812
So much do I esteem them that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit that I may converse with him teteatete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as I said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	141.2086639404297
Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will talk	36.09397888183594
Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters	39.61896896362305
Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	33.96086883544922
Well he said to the lieutenant	1219.365234375
Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is impossible	63.74319076538086
Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me	115.57211303710938
I will do it with all my heart said Comminges for I know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty I know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested	69.07130432128906
I am entirely at your service except only for my orders	80.60942077636719
Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree	121.12268829345703
If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your demand	47.5558967590332
I do nt like Mazarin any better than you do	103.26495361328125
I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my will	61.97029113769531
Speak then I beg of you I wait and listen	155.65777587890625
Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that DArtagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am here	43.16921615600586
I have received no orders on that point	37.71257019042969
Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his neighbor	196.55943298339844
Tell him also what you have just told methat Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity	158.31483459472656
Which can not last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison here	215.09442138671875
But there are oubliettes replied Athos smiling	27.54713249206543
Oh that s a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comminges	48.22822189331055
It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarinimpossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves	41.310096740722656
Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them	30.28965950012207
Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your disappearance	37.10960006713867
No no be easy on that score	193.22779846191406
I will however inform Monsieur dArtagnan of your arrival here	105.82432556152344
Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery	14.429707527160645
They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers	83.1252212524414
In the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by Mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where DArtagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where Athos was to be	86.49254608154297
From the ends of these two wings extended the park	899.1173095703125
Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where DArtagnan was confined	75.73786163330078
Yes tis too true said Comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours countyou who are the very flower of our nobilityto squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the Frondists Really count if ever I thought that I had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you	1573.8828125
A Frondeur you the Comte de la Fere on the side of Broussel Blancmesnil and Viole For shame you a Frondeur	131.37339782714844
On my word of honor said Athos one must be either a Mazarinist or a Frondeur	147.5426483154297
For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French word	2.000459671020508
And now I am a Frondeurnot of Broussels party nor of Blancmesnils nor am I with Viole but with the Duc de Beaufort the Ducs de Bouillon and dElbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and lowborn lawyers	25.771297454833984
Besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal Look at that wallwithout a single windowwhich tells you fine things about Mazarins gratitude	88.014404296875
Yes replied De Comminges more especially if it could reveal how Monsieur dArtagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him	85.66197204589844
Poor DArtagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves	93.0646743774414
You have two unruly prisoners there sir	58.93479919433594
Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I suppose	19.925657272338867
When he came here Monsieur DArtagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword back	123.26315307617188
That mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of laughing	16.67051887512207
And Du Vallon asked Athos	155.087890625
Ah he s quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman indeed	67.8472900390625
The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left Gaza	362.5331726074219
But his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it	211.54855346679688
So much the better said Athos	77.80992889404297
Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	46.6707649230957
Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by DArtagnan	159.71095275878906
Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheadsthe one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	68.57461547851562
You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me	14.83551025390625
This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	270.15533447265625
Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	174.6118927001953
He awaited Mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	20.738309860229492
Chapter LXXXIII	75.93096160888672
Strength and Sagacity	23.933589935302734
Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge	82.8844985961914
At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor	97.59979248046875
It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that DArtagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament	48.50007247924805
DArtagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants offices	261.3164367675781
Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	222.65086364746094
The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	65.69935607910156
The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	27.83776092529297
But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	122.84976959228516
Look said DArtagnan day is declining	72.80923461914062
It must be nearly four oclock	187.56495666503906
We have been in this place nearly eightythree hours	60.68535232543945
Hem muttered Porthos with a kind of pretense of answering	113.7213134765625
Did you hear eternal sleeper cried DArtagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night	48.61079406738281
What said Porthos	80.28524017333984
I say we have been here eightythree hours	176.02828979492188
Tis your fault answered Porthos	62.29063415527344
How my fault	73.38777160644531
Yes I offered you escape	90.41160583496094
By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door	15.171648979187012
Porthos men like us ca nt go out from here purely and simply	146.6259765625
Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much	105.5534439086914
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders	4.0353288650512695
And besides he said going out of this chamber is nt all	295.32037353515625
Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were yesterday	576.5191040039062
Explain to me why going out of this chamber is nt everything	107.01197814941406
Because having neither arms nor password we should nt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel	153.05531311035156
Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms	137.13079833984375
Yes but before we can kill himand he will be hard to kill that Swisshe will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of Rueil which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the moon is like the sun	36.397342681884766
Lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle	44.24519348144531
Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rueil	123.7244644165039
What difference does that make said Porthos	59.89297866821289
We shall go out all the same	91.44795227050781
Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands	104.35499572753906
No said Porthos but I should be glad to be informed	848.558349609375
It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked	73.95073699951172
What then	384.521484375
Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at	34.10961151123047
And what have master pastrycooks to do with us	187.83497619628906
We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	48.22473907470703
In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation	44.48882293701172
By whom then were we beaten asked Porthos	11.521093368530273
By Mordaunt	30.087417602539062
Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mordaunt	56.03041076660156
That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us	20.2957706451416
But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	29.059383392333984
We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of	29.57227325439453
That is true said Porthos echoing DArtagnans sigh	165.3170928955078
Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea	161.1434326171875
But do nt sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep	56.436134338378906
As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	181.7069091796875
I do nt believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of Monsieur de Mazarin	105.91999053955078
How well you reason said Porthos admiringly	113.15184020996094
Well yes pretty well replied DArtagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere	86.5912094116211
Yes that is inevitable said Porthos	81.17798614501953
Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keenscented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	198.80038452148438
Then believe me it will be time to act	6.157480716705322
Yes we will wait	149.28746032714844
We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least	52.22648620605469
What is that	636.7010498046875
Did you observe DArtagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton	122.04973602294922
No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never mind	18.894081115722656
And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my castles	7.62462043762207
Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the ground	154.16258239746094
Do you think that likely	174.63294982910156
No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it	3.0082876682281494
You reconcile me DArtagnan	334.73980712890625
Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we ca nt corrupt them	167.82431030273438
Try Porthos to please them more than you are wo nt to do when they are under our windows	122.53121948242188
Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it is	123.72382354736328
Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis only	279.3655700683594
So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind DArtagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pistoles	28.80657958984375
The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates	41.56698226928711
What exclaimed Porthos mutton again	122.91920471191406
My dear Monsieur de Comminges said DArtagnan you will find that my friend Monsieur du Vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if Cardinal Mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day	147.80735778808594
I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it away	20.28122901916504
Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his appetite	823.126953125
Is Mazarin dead asked Porthos	552.5480346679688
No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well	243.90316772460938
So much the worse said Porthos	119.37006378173828
What is that news asked DArtagnan	62.34174346923828
News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatiencethe more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good	29.30234146118164
Should you be glad to hear that the Comte de la Fere is well asked De Comminges	165.9539031982422
DArtagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	170.00462341308594
Glad he cried I should be more than glad Happybeyond measure	180.57901000976562
Well I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health	289.9333190917969
DArtagnan almost leaped with joy	100.15542602539062
A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will act	164.58221435546875
Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood	74.62511444091797
Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself	148.10450744628906
Yes sir	108.06522369384766
Then you have seen him	57.57276153564453
Certainly I have	61.643775939941406
Where if I may ask without indiscretion	308.5940246582031
Near here replied De Comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are	299.40380859375
He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought DArtagnan	44.85039138793945
Then he said aloud	116.02139282226562
You met him I dare say in the parkhunting perhaps	20.347848892211914
No nearer nearer still	43.017730712890625
Look behind this wall said De Comminges knocking against the wall	61.08271026611328
Behind this wall What is there then behind this wall I was brought here by night so devil take me if I know where I am	283.4931945800781
Well said Comminges suppose one thing	48.71342468261719
I will suppose anything you please	210.667236328125
Suppose there were a window in this wall	70.10905456542969
From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at his	170.85614013671875
The count then is in the chateau	541.2630004882812
For what reason	129.21009826660156
The same as yourself	111.46082305908203
Athosa prisoner	50.52144241333008
You know well replied De Comminges that there are no prisoners at Rueil because there is no prison	940.6121826171875
Do nt let us play upon words sir	33.493896484375
Athos has been arrested	39.83701705932617
Yesterday at Saint Germain as he came out from the presence of the queen	83.11095428466797
The arms of DArtagnan fell powerless by his side	50.45627212524414
One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately	89.00862121582031
A prisoner he reiterated	80.08279418945312
A prisoner repeated Porthos quite dejected	27.875995635986328
Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before	108.7425308227539
Come come said Comminges who since DArtagnan on the day of Broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him do nt be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad news	65.50940704345703
Laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it	375.75738525390625
But DArtagnan was still in a desponding mood	68.6109848022461
And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that DArtagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	26.702001571655273
Very well indeed sir replied Comminges at first like you he seemed distressed but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening	25.59113121032715
Ah cried DArtagnan the cardinal is about to visit the Comte de la Fere	193.69171142578125
Yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself	30.54697608947754
Ah our dear count said DArtagnan	10.086945533752441
A fine thing indeed grunted Porthos	410.6954040527344
A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Mazarin	81.19436645507812
No matter said DArtagnan in his most wheedling tone	112.75812530517578
On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to hope	125.6343765258789
In fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be mistaken	44.02804183959961
What I am mistaken	19998.27734375
Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him	41.71150588989258
No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to me	120.34910583496094
He will come and visit the Comte de la Fere	33.5974235534668
DArtagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward him	80.357666015625
It is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked DArtagnan	54.435855865478516
Every evening he shuts himself in there	28.19801902770996
That it seems is where he meditates on state affairs	29.678590774536133
In that case said DArtagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort	284.04583740234375
Yestwo soldiers	383.6791687011719
And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers	127.0370864868164
The soldiers are Swiss who understand only German	619.58447265625
Besides according to all probability they will wait at the door	43.18954849243164
DArtagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	149.76914978027344
Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said DArtagnan for the count must be furious	69.20551300048828
Comminges began to laugh	163.32229614257812
Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance	96.69164276123047
Two soldiers said DArtagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window	61.78034210205078
That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out	49.177635192871094
Finelooking men upon my word said DArtagnan	78.72115325927734
They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal	101.60122680664062
Ah monsieur said DArtagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our liberty	68.79927062988281
I wish it with all my heart said Comminges	206.76828002929688
Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it	52.91565704345703
Not at all	54.57647705078125
Ah that gives me more confidence	93.36126708984375
This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascons soul	55.89139175415039
Now said DArtagnan I ve one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comminges	163.6227264404297
At your service sir	167.9728240966797
You will see the count again	111.67047882080078
Tomorrow morning	88.27259826660156
Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained	221.77001953125
You want the cardinal to come here	303.1693420410156
No I know my place and am not so presumptuous	26.510608673095703
Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I want	64.14221954345703
Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man	45.23659133911133
I promise you it shall be done answered De Comminges	34.52888488769531
Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but resigned	111.65882110595703
I am pleased sir to hear that	72.53910064697266
And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon	201.52597045898438
Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means resigned	31.673643112182617
But you will be resigned my friend	82.44279479980469
He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows himself	117.24748992919922
Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign yourself	41.89837646484375
Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well	93.59974670410156
We will try	286.6859130859375
De Comminges went away DArtagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted	491.3507995605469
Oh cried Porthos what s the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend	48.7448616027832
What is the matter returned DArtagnan we are saved	26.430767059326172
I do nt see that at all answered Porthos	2236.890380859375
I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarins mousetrap	2.000459671020508
Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned DArtagnan	254.9913787841797
I do nt understand said Porthos	41.39872741699219
Never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night	157.03160095214844
What are we to do then tonight	172.2387237548828
To travelperhaps	40.4228515625
Sit down dear friend to table	132.45758056640625
When one is eating ideas flow easily	67.11246490478516
After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to you	275.6207275390625
So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by DArtagnans inventive imagination	80.79710388183594
Chapter LXXXIV	36.97604751586914
Strength and SagacityContinued	280.0696716308594
Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of DArtagnan	39.28601837158203
Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	136.7934112548828
At dessert DArtagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease	87.65847778320312
Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at DArtagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfellowship	309.8556213378906
Well said DArtagnan at last	69.1593017578125
Well repeated Porthos	66.2912826538086
You were saying my dear friend	41.53742599487305
No I said nothing	42.40016555786133
Yes you were saying you wished to leave this place	169.82766723632812
Ah indeed the will was never wanting	80.97502136230469
To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall	67.40570068359375
Tis trueI said so and I say it again	124.79228210449219
And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we could nt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves	105.32342529296875
That is true we should need clothes and arms	150.36781311035156
Well said DArtagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something better	56.968292236328125
Bah said Porthos looking around	68.95852661132812
Useless to look everything will come to us when wanted	115.48634338378906
At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday	39.16423416137695
An hour after sunset	76.3951644897461
If they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour	100.40154266357422
In a quarter of an hour at most	168.9978790283203
Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos	125.74867248535156
Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man	136.5237579345703
Yes indeed said he I believe so	314.98614501953125
So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew	62.79508590698242
And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion	46.273048400878906
There he cried	66.85395050048828
Capital exclaimed the Gascon	25.326828002929688
Really Porthos you are a gifted individual	30.818029403686523
I have heard speak said Porthos of a certain Milo of Crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting itof killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera	56.62820053100586
I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples	178.80706787109375
Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his friend	60.08784484863281
No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naivete	68.45990753173828
Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar	47.5316162109375
Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed	1033.1702880859375
Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that	186.72140502929688
Shall I take out any more of them asked Porthos	57.08622741699219
No that is sufficient a man can pass through that	53.1038932800293
Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	461.3204040527344
Yes he said	101.08816528320312
Now pass your arm through this opening	46.03314971923828
You will know presentlypass it	54.760009765625
Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	204.25881958007812
Admirable said DArtagnan	48.73468017578125
The scheme goes forward it seems	78.03553771972656
On wheels dear friend	145.0697021484375
Good What shall I do now	6.245054244995117
It is finished then	57.7647819519043
No not yet	29.395273208618164
I should like to understand said Porthos	28.034870147705078
Listen my dear friend in two words you will know all	202.6354522705078
The door of the guardhouse opens as you see	56.0238151550293
Yes I see	45.72373580932617
They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him	69.95191192626953
There they are coming out	38.22971725463867
If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close it	2.000459671020508
What then	71.36638641357422
Silence They may hear us	84.53178405761719
I do nt understand it at all	226.62127685546875
As you execute you will understand	126.46075439453125
And yet I should have preferred	413.6002502441406
You will have the pleasure of the surprise	96.7509994506836
Ah that is true	129.18336486816406
Porthos remained silent and motionless	55.13899612426758
In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of February	73.00753021240234
At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away	73.7376708984375
Now said DArtagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to him	62.17280197143555
Do nt lose a word of what I m going to say to you Porthos	97.36592864990234
Everything lies in the execution	40.98191833496094
Good the execution of plots is my forte	79.3592758178711
I know it well	257.21453857421875
I depend on you	189.72694396972656
Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us	27.382341384887695
But supposing he does nt mount	153.61215209960938
He will rely upon it	129.26925659179688
As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck	81.20071411132812
Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he ca nt cry out	266.7320556640625
Oh said Porthos	125.7362060546875
Suppose I happen to strangle him	78.57950592041016
To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I hope	57.02245330810547
Lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomewhere	155.02882385253906
So we shall get from him one uniform and a sword	18.607276916503906
Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound admiration	308.6108093261719
Pooh replied DArtagnan	162.2915802001953
Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two	35.74811553955078
Well but there s his comrade	40.899837493896484
True said Porthos	22.087139129638672
Therefore when I cough stretch out your arm	96.37872314453125
The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window	51.02787780761719
Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	78.79927062988281
Goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent	147.97215270996094
Tis not too warm to walk resumed DArtagnan	14.655146598815918
No sir	4.929656028747559
And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you	4.929656028747559
A glass of wine will be extremely welcome	43.78958511352539
The fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porthos	80.44204711914062
I understand said Porthos	180.95111083984375
A bottle perhaps	149.00299072265625
A whole bottle Yes sir	741.9398803710938
A whole bottle if you will drink my health	138.94110107421875
Willingly answered the soldier	61.728546142578125
Come then and take it friend said the Gascon	119.04669189453125
With all my heart	81.1178970336914
How convenient that there s a bench here	69.24760437011719
Egad one would think it had been placed here on purpose	73.4921646118164
Get on it that s it friend	14.166172981262207
And DArtagnan coughed	143.49847412109375
That instant the arm of Porthos fell	56.8493766784668
His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers throat	92.1533203125
He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage	69.4416732788086
He then laid him down on the floor where DArtagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle	71.5315933227539
Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	140.6431884765625
Heres a sword and a dress said Porthos	56.16370391845703
I take them said DArtagnan for myself	26.792503356933594
If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again	65.3319091796875
Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us	308.9344177246094
I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	10.922313690185547
No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged	91.92765045166016
That is better said the Gascon	63.589881896972656
Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the opening	6.180846214294434
He did as he said	91.51692199707031
Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him	42.690547943115234
Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of oak	37.74856185913086
This operation proved as great a success as the first	89.34144592285156
There said DArtagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	169.26046752929688
Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers	43.40971755981445
It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos perfectly	83.52513122558594
They then dressed themselves	155.7049102783203
Tis done they both exclaimed at once	195.52313232421875
As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men	25.8648738861084
The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it	17.0428524017334
Now said DArtagnan you would nt be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos	2644.58154296875
Well no not very	413.5829162597656
Well then we shall go down into the court	199.5756072998047
We shall take the place of those two fellows	44.46355438232422
We will walk back and forth	44.04146957397461
That s a good idea for it is nt warm	54.82851791381836
In a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before	121.04936218261719
And we shall answer	15.519838333129883
No on the contrary we shall not answer	72.73712158203125
As you please I do nt insist on answering	29.111570358276367
We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence	117.52635192871094
Where shall we escort him	115.05513000488281
Where he is goingto visit Athos	52.71019744873047
Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us	46.052467346191406
Oh cried Porthos oh I understand	76.00228118896484
Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you have nt reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting tone	2086.612548828125
What is to happen said Porthos	137.00021362304688
Follow me replied DArtagnan	134.31988525390625
The man who lives to see shall see	43.35137176513672
And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court	289.1006164550781
Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence	86.78743743896484
They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber	64.9019546508789
Scarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valetdechambre called out	58.4560661315918
Make ready	35.82167053222656
At the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out	51.960079193115234
La Bruyere and Du Barthois March	73.41609191894531
It seems that I am named La Bruyere remarked DArtagnan	124.16690063476562
And I Du Barthois added Porthos	226.8677978515625
Where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom	98.24087524414062
Here we are said the Gascon	56.4775390625
What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porthos	140.2982940673828
If it but lasts most capital responded Porthos	1313.3770751953125
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valetdechambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waitingroom and showing them two stools	58.54622268676758
Your orders are very simple he said do nt allow anybody except one person to enter here	58.327735900878906
Do you hearnot a single creature Obey that person implicitly	268.6624450683594
On your return you can not make a mistake	77.30766296386719
You have only to wait here till I release you	46.984458923339844
DArtagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	235.4315185546875
The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent possible	235.91171264648438
As for Porthos on whom DArtagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply mute	78.20484161376953
All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel	411.78570556640625
Bernouin shut the door and went away	47.34511184692383
When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another	6.838708877563477
Porthos my friend said DArtagnan do nt distrust Providence Let me meditate and consider	213.6560516357422
Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn	93.04381561279297
We have walked eight paces whispered DArtagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	95.24079895019531
The Comte de la Fere can not be far off only the doors are locked	32.02972412109375
That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders	50.6484489440918
For Gods sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	163.72824096679688
Have you not heard that some one is coming here	276.0870361328125
Well that some one will open the doors	2.000459671020508
But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you do nt propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the church	47.342018127441406
That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or Germans	61.21065139770508
Oh may God keep me from it and you too said DArtagnan	126.39739227294922
The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider	102.75383758544922
And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh	72.21923828125
So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of it	194.49246215820312
Hush said DArtagnan the some one is coming	118.43350219726562
The sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	792.6748657226562
The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes	60.48099899291992
Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern	88.50955200195312
Light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling	97.22128295898438
Then addressing DArtagnan	169.71400451660156
You know the watchword he said	180.6956329345703
Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German tongue	128.86000061035156
Tedesco answered the cavalier va bene	33.94348907470703
And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went	115.85427856445312
Now asked Porthos what are we to do	48.914180755615234
Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be locked	31.880441665649414
Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently	114.32079315185547
But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier	165.37281799316406
The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	85.3145751953125
There said DArtagnan we ca nt be overtaken	62.218441009521484
Come forward	74.98004913330078
Chapter LXXXV	111.95551300048828
The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin	193.37196350097656
At first on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed DArtagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of Porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way DArtagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock	134.46324157714844
The bolt gave way and the door opened	52.928993225097656
As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness	21.40770149230957
You re a great moralist and that s the fact said Porthos	74.15837097167969
They entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinals lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys	29.24709701538086
No cardinal said DArtagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he	112.06671142578125
Exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to Porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture	106.10789489746094
Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested	231.97035217285156
DArtagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	84.2623519897461
He called Porthos to look at it	50.18142318725586
Were our object money only he said we should be rich directly	108.45906066894531
How s that	89.85961151123047
Do nt you understand Porthos At the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinals treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orangetree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came fromnot even the cardinal	67.66580963134766
It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porthos	34.9746208190918
So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gascon	81.2021484375
At the same moment whilst DArtagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase	44.536014556884766
Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	841.702392578125
Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in Paris	104.19783020019531
I am a great captainthat I am but I make war in my own way	23.774383544921875
The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley	52.5385856628418
Mazarin came within three steps of DArtagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place	138.04916381835938
Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la Fere	491.70306396484375
Very good thought DArtagnan tis our road likewise we will go together	206.81996154785156
All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	16.377094268798828
The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps	253.15496826171875
He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	244.32467651367188
Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of devils	157.30162048339844
And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	279.32440185546875
Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said DArtagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are	134.5226287841797
Yeshere we are said Porthos	25.36839485168457
And he made the same friendly salute as DArtagnan	47.76167678833008
Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	41.88242721557617
DArtagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	104.06014251708984
Oh what imprudence my lord said DArtagnan tis not good to be about just here without a light	42.15470504760742
Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole	46.947357177734375
Monsieur dArtagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	60.507652282714844
Yes my lord it is I	44.646697998046875
I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly	49.559993743896484
And DArtagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking	45.079444885253906
You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagnan	344.14776611328125
Do nt let us disarrange your eminence	34.32155227661133
Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you	31614.1328125
Mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses	100.17023468017578
Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury	861.020751953125
Porthos opened his mouth to reply DArtagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	73.1125717163086
This moment come my lord said DArtagnan	33.294708251953125
Mazarin breathed again	91.06658935546875
His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	117.1404800415039
A sort of smile played on his lips	32.775421142578125
Come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen	24.165685653686523
I confess myself conquered	299.7479248046875
You wish to ask for liberty andI give it you	147.33364868164062
Oh my lord answered DArtagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you	120.40765380859375
You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in terror	157.9815216064453
Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again	176.856689453125
Mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts core	188.2432098388672
His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porthos	145.90391540527344
Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them	49.74619674682617
To purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	22.798233032226562
Yes my lord	40.16640090942383
And how much will that cost me Monsieur dArtagnan	84.07215881347656
Zounds my lord I do nt know yet	44.11069869995117
We must ask the Comte de la Fere the question	345.8218994140625
Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be settled	49.9940185546875
Mazarin started	35.4016227722168
My lord said DArtagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect but I must warn you that we have no time to lose open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities	800.10498046875
Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of honor	51.840065002441406
DArtagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin	516.6589965820312
Now my lord let us enter if you please	335.31781005859375
Chapter LXXXVI	139.62564086914062
Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given him	33.10054016113281
On perceiving Mazarin he bowed	16.375579833984375
Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it	487.531494140625
And so my dear count said DArtagnan his eminence did nt actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you	89.7208480834961
At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of surprise	79.1481704711914
DArtagnan Porthos he exclaimed	266.8148498535156
My very self dear friend	70.00626373291016
Me also repeated Porthos	162.72117614746094
What means this asked the count	32.50435256958008
It means replied Mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs but gentlemen I warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue	95.89678192138672
Ah my lord cried the Gascon do nt threaten tis a bad example	90.0382080078125
We are so good and gentle to your eminence	148.9857177734375
Come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly	40.7580451965332
There s nothing I wish more replied Mazarin	36.33990478515625
But do nt think yourselves in a better position than you are	68.5861587524414
In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	106.80072784423828
How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors	106.98570251464844
Now I am going to show you how sincere I am	27.597360610961914
Good thought DArtagnan we must look about us he s going to play us a trick	40.78998947143555
I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you	48.18150329589844
He is right thought Athos	331.09393310546875
And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes	106.85987091064453
And therefore said DArtagnan to clip the hope which Athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity	231.9274139404297
If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty	204.23233032226562
Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from us	149.4068145751953
Noon the faith of a cardinal	68.8177719116211
You do not believe me	68.34636688232422
My lord I never believe cardinals who are not priests	46.00273132324219
Well on the faith of a minister	182.9027862548828
You are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner	57.591129302978516
Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the cardinal	120.64126586914062
Hem replied DArtagnan	376.4605712890625
I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question	13.97988510131836
I fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence	107.57172393798828
Monsieur dArtagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with you	41.482688903808594
My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing better	33.794368743896484
Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable	136.67916870117188
Ah that is another thing said Porthos	126.05467224121094
Let us see said Athos	57.16069412231445
Let us see said DArtagnan	242.59666442871094
In the first place do you accept asked the cardinal	128.4545440673828
Unfold your plan my lord and we will see	78.62440490722656
Take notice that you are shut upcaptured	516.705322265625
You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource	144.065185546875
That of dying together	91.25846099853516
Mazarin shuddered	87.71855926513672
Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the park	118.94449615478516
Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms	286.6216735839844
At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free	129.01100158691406
Ah by Jove my lord said DArtagnan you have well said but these are only words	38.86281204223633
Where is the key you speak of	112.30470275878906
Here it is	25.940378189086914
Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door	129.60580444335938
Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door	93.69722747802734
It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces	61.116825103759766
The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my lord	89.27202606201172
We do nt know the locality and shall never find the wall	45.417354583740234
Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall	155.2328338623047
Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant	104.1661376953125
Are you satisfied gentlemen asked Mazarin	19.252605438232422
I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	40.616233825683594
Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed	1099.6136474609375
You are mistaken	29.30329704284668
Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are armed	50.060630798339844
The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves	95.23661804199219
Tis true	85.86182403564453
Where can we find another sword asked Porthos	2.000459671020508
My lord said DArtagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la Fere	165.3280487060547
Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my sake	157.63357543945312
I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Athos	411.22528076171875
Well well cried DArtagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos	123.97274780273438
Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the wind	76.05445098876953
Now climb up Athos quickly said DArtagnan	52.10026550292969
Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	90.81121826171875
Now jump down Athos	56.001834869384766
Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	139.0830841064453
Are you on the ground asked DArtagnan	165.73532104492188
Without accident	89.45384979248047
Perfectly safe and sound	116.09555053710938
Porthos whilst I get up watch the cardinal	191.59120178222656
No I do nt want your help watch the cardinal	53.903079986572266
I am watching said Porthos	63.16443634033203
You are right it is more difficult than I thought	80.55709075927734
Lend me your backbut do nt let the cardinal go	46.90393829345703
Porthos lent him his back and DArtagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	114.5311279296875
Mazarin pretended to laugh	7.053044319152832
Are you there asked Porthos	10.689953804016113
Yes my friend and now	93.00035095214844
Now what asked Porthos	770.8187866210938
Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him	145.31228637695312
Mazarin wished to call out but Porthos held him tight and passed him to DArtagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said	45.26259231567383
Sir jump directly down close to Monsieur de la Fere or on the honor of a gentleman Ill kill you	50.11594772338867
Monsieur monsieur cried Mazarin you are breaking your word to me	104.55069732666016
Idid I promise you anything my lord	96.63762664794922
Mazarin groaned	37.35353469848633
You are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom	16.785842895507812
Agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircasemust not one speak of that a little my lord	28.37950897216797
Diavolo cried Mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands I am a lost and ruined man	70.5680160522461
But without listening to his protestations of alarm DArtagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of Athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall	139.08030700683594
Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the summit	40.16598129272461
I did nt understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is	136.02737426757812
You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the end let us not lose time	40.33897399902344
And he jumped off the wall	130.44935607910156
Porthos did the same	43.771183013916016
Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said DArtagnan for myself I will reconnoitre	108.79637145996094
The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard	94.75338745117188
My lord he said which way do we go Think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us	52.83638000488281
Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves	176.90357971191406
The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace	41.85786056518555
The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	86.58035278320312
Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm which moved	92.07408905029297
Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse	296.1508483886719
And I likewise said Athos	104.24747467041016
I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	112.19979095458984
There s luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk	56.50027084350586
But as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced	39.673431396484375
Touch it not	118.69005584716797
Grimaud he cried Grimaud what art thou about Why thou art posted here by Heaven	111.50579833984375
No sir said the honest servant it was Monsieur Aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses	57.055145263671875
Is Aramis here	45.27678680419922
Yes sir he has been here since yesterday	60.091251373291016
What are you doing	64.29042053222656
On the watch	43.02471923828125
What Aramis here cried Athos	58.35163116455078
At the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there	148.43905639648438
Are you a large party	47.31346893310547
Let him know	236.8562774658203
This moment sir	3519.740234375
And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return	80.36429595947266
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin	238.67832946777344
Chapter LXXXVII	104.79801177978516
Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and DArtagnan a Captain	28.948083877563477
At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten followers	91.92440795898438
He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	31.10268783569336
You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts	178.2430877685547
Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Athos	159.77090454101562
I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the woods	96.95332336425781
Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the queen	115.99999237060547
Mazarin listened intently	432.9653625488281
But said DArtagnan I trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal	98.7469253540039
Ah yes said Aramis toward him I should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment In one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	102.39305877685547
In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	101.79694366455078
You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last letter	174.54345703125
I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till tomorrow and I did nt hope to free you without a skirmish	136.7810821533203
You are free tonight without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of him	80.505859375
Not very much said DArtagnan	154.6000518798828
I might even say that we have some reason to praise him	118.49015808105469
Yes really it is owing to him that we are free	106.67552185058594
Owing to him	68.51692199707031
Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valetdechambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la Fere	60.95518112182617
Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	173.5298614501953
He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grimaud	39.736602783203125
Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an act	90.8978271484375
My lord said DArtagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier dHerblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your eminence	84.83580017089844
And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aramis	46.664710998535156
Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse	49.28328323364258
Several horsemen ran quickly to him	94.49976348876953
Zounds cried Aramis I may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage I will lay a wager that twas that Saint Christopher Porthos who performed this feat Apropos I forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen	102.32951354980469
I think it will be wise to set off said DArtagnan	70.39906311035156
Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Athos	95.70802307128906
A friend exclaimed the count	82.82666015625
And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the bushes	55.66035079956055
The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos start	135.4342041015625
Raoul Raoul he ejaculated	245.75379943847656
For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his fathers neck	174.5386199951172
Look my lord cardinal said Aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love Gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	108.75450897216797
He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his eminence	69.98030090332031
Aramis then joined Athos and DArtagnan who were consulting together	76.11674499511719
Come said DArtagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey	105.4291000366211
Where are we to go asked Porthos	206.94227600097656
To your house dear Porthos at Pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situatedneither too near Paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility	40.80658721923828
Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are	260.0054931640625
A fallen prince exclaimed Mazarin piteously	33.350887298583984
The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them	232.83871459960938
No but we shall make use of them said DArtagnan	300.785400390625
The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days	54.165374755859375
Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	100.35415649414062
At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	65.09899139404297
Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degenerates	264.86285400390625
I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aramis	182.54408264160156
He is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	220.4059600830078
We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later	55.933807373046875
Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to fear	81.22332763671875
Grimaud in fact brought back five horses	104.67645263671875
The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them	74.81747436523438
Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin carefully	69.24107360839844
At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierrefonds	298.8669128417969
Ah said Mousqueton who had ridden by the side of DArtagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but I can breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends	104.01445007324219
We are four of us said DArtagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time	22.193471908569336
Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison	14.166172981262207
That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyoringeneral and Aramis governor of the fortress	69.94776916503906
Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau	157.4842071533203
Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito	171.36380004882812
No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here	171.90232849121094
Then you will be besieged	198.97213745117188
We expect it	49.06043243408203
And what shall you do	61.75748825073242
Defend ourselves	165.5691375732422
Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army	192.2476348876953
Such feats sir are done onceand never repeated	145.8038330078125
However nowadays there s no need of so much heroism	98.82709503173828
Tomorrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or VillarsCotterets	81.4922103881836
The prince will vanquish you as he has always done	71.919677734375
Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has three	71.25189971923828
We will not expose your eminence to the chances of war	81.15577697753906
Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capitulate	99.29644775390625
Before a siege	255.6837921142578
Yes the conditions will be better than afterward	145.9869384765625
Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are	144.34092712402344
Come now what are your conditions	95.54464721679688
Rest yourself first my lord and wewe will reflect	55.01970291137695
I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or friends	46.342506408691406
Friends my lord friends	134.51589965820312
Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be possible	80.4382553100586
Speak Comte de la Fere	119.80133056640625
My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to demand	253.58847045898438
For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too much	81.3341293334961
I beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier	84.54480743408203
And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene	25.9888916015625
Speak then chevalier said the cardinal	594.5061645507812
What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you please	71.53207397460938
Be clear short and precise	69.18294525146484
As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which I formed onewent yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on you	60.60921096801758
Let us consider first the ancient rights	36.04830551147461
The demands in that programme must be granted	242.76954650878906
We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations	49.75571060180664
You suppose then that there are some said Aramis smiling	193.34088134765625
I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Athos	44.93630599975586
My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last	58.36635208129883
The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions	605.6137084960938
He is a proud soulhe is a man by himself You are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you	690.0217895507812
Aramis said Athos are you jesting	11.91491985321045
No no dear friend I state only what we all know	197.80667114257812
You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself	10.735520362854004
Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited	60.93992614746094
I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution	66.60782623291016
I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the Pope	14.549727439880371
That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an exile	10.192978858947754
I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends	22.849454879760742
Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to DArtagnan	18.202524185180664
And you sir he said	65.65140533447266
I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur dHerblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the first	63.50654602050781
Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman	187.45774841308594
I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name	180.3468475341797
And you Monsieur du Vallon	140.103759765625
Yes you sir Speak if you please said Mazarin	68.58438873291016
As for me answered Porthos I wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers	110.31828308105469
You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs	18.807592391967773
My friends will submit them	89.18386840820312
Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided	142.27682495117188
Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly	74.295166015625
All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease others	49.29733657836914
If I stay in Paris I can not go to Rome if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur dArtagnan a captain and Monsieur du Vallon a baron	107.37590789794922
True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneurs resignation	251.8326416015625
I am to remain minister then said Mazarin	131.42333984375
You remain minister that is understood said DArtagnan France needs you	1235.5556640625
And I desist from my pretensions said Aramis	82.10469055175781
His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for ourselves	90.6705093383789
Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Mazarin	121.66169738769531
Ho ho replied Aramis	123.19692993164062
The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to it	398.4943542480469
I can answer only for myself said Mazarin	129.56614685058594
I can not answer for the queen	276.5455322265625
Suppose her majesty refuses	104.13763427734375
Oh said DArtagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing	61.642154693603516
Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Frondeurs	270.4227600097656
Will your eminence please read and examine	20.34184455871582
I am acquainted with it	194.3894500732422
Sign it then	178.37844848632812
Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence	38.30135726928711
Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given	136.70249938964844
Suppose I refuse	69.8638687133789
Then said DArtagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal	46.14509582519531
Would you dare to touch a cardinal	304.83013916015625
You have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musketeers	173.19729614257812
The queen will revenge me gentlemen	31.20722770690918
I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend us	56.74345779418945
How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aramis	431.635986328125
How they must be asking Where is the cardinal What has become of the minister Where has the favorite gone How they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners What comments must be made and if the Fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the Fronde must triumph	86.6216049194336
It is frightful murmured Mazarin	166.2930145263672
Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aramis	121.33697509765625
Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it	110.15448760986328
Ah nonsense cried DArtagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent method	84.35871887207031
I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted	76.85542297363281
And then asked Mazarin turning pale	48.94440460205078
When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box	179.15545654296875
Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty	181.33766174316406
Here it is replied Aramis	2036.9517822265625
Sign my lord and he gave him a pen	232.4637451171875
Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	64.92987823486328
And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee	117.55667877197266
My word of honor sir said Athos	30.093847274780273
Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen	120.79248809814453
It is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	2.000459671020508
And now Monsieur dArtagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the queen	66.91949462890625
Chapter LXXXVIII	146.43397521972656
Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword	134.139404296875
DArtagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it	31.127574920654297
He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six hours	379.5727844238281
But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him	459.1169128417969
In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	99.92764282226562
What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal perhaps	95.55631256103516
Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pygmean	78.3730239868164
He went to find Aramis	69.64511108398438
You my dear Chevalier dHerblay he said are the Fronde incarnate	92.92755889892578
Mistrust Athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	141.04769897460938
Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarins escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric	74.87211608886719
Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute	118.52705383300781
Fear nothing he said I have my conditions to impose	43.79613494873047
My private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side	24.501930236816406
Good thought DArtagnan in this direction I am satisfied	177.2393798828125
He pressed Aramiss hand and went in search of Porthos	38.98772430419922
Friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by Aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by Athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself does nt sympathize with the desires of others	280.9610290527344
What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go	53.64904022216797
Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily	45.134220123291016
Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you hanged	37.16969680786133
Do you think so	45.153114318847656
I am sure of it	48.326541900634766
Then I would kill him rather than let him go	139.51548767089844
And you would act rightly	47.04669952392578
There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides do nt understand political matters as we old soldiers do	39.86037826538086
Never fear dear friend said Porthos	225.54776000976562
I shall see you through the window as you mount your horse I shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then I shall place myself at the cardinals doora door with glass windows	714.2119750976562
I shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign I shall begin to exterminate	116.37590026855469
Bravo thought DArtagnan on this side I think the cardinal will be well guarded	63.443416595458984
He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Athos	102.98358917236328
My dear Athos he said I am going away	70.42689514160156
I have only one thing to say to you	93.52729034423828
You know Anne of Austria the captivity of Mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go I am a dead man	39.658443450927734
I needed nothing less than that consideration my dear DArtagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer	48.35053634643555
I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him	71.12945556640625
This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought DArtagnan	40.20845413208008
Now that I have the word of Athos I can set out	360.25213623046875
DArtagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	114.78623962402344
Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germain	198.26502990722656
The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known	46.92364501953125
Anne of Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	52.52477264404297
In the chamber of DArtagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	69.869140625
On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	44.52568817138672
But as to what had been done by Porthos and DArtagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau	58.08776092529297
Bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	53.76275634765625
Bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery	117.39691925048828
The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion	52.82915115356445
Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athoss chamber and that of the park	113.05973052978516
From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow	57.35700607299805
He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Enghien	87.38011932373047
He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that disappearance	41.42075729370117
Anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the Prince de Cond who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from Rueil in whatsoever direction it might be	103.16564178466797
Now since DArtagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	252.3572235107422
On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master	289.8888244628906
At the sight of DArtagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken	254.5363006591797
But DArtagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	463.0065002441406
Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur dArtagnan	31.492366790771484
Himself Monsieur Bernouin	174.990966796875
And why have you come here	68.93778228759766
To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarinthe freshest news there is	650.3328247070312
What has become of him then	519.2713623046875
He is as well as you and I	34.699344635009766
Nothing bad has happened to him then	105.42431640625
Absolutely nothing	107.34422302246094
He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged usthe Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallonto accompany him	84.24781036376953
We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	153.63340759277344
We set out last evening and here we are	40.718650817871094
Here you are	56.47853469848633
His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and privatea mission that could be confided only to a sure manand so has sent me to Saint Germain	66.70259857177734
And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what purpose	103.0406723022461
Whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances DArtagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce Monsieur dArtagnan at once	87.14864349365234
DArtagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter	128.77210998535156
It was however merely a letter of introduction	1175.470947265625
The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars	88.33604431152344
DArtagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions	121.10028076171875
The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	44.731597900390625
She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	205.49462890625
How sir she cried as DArtagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crimeto give me an account of your treason	126.80777740478516
Pardon madame but I think that either I have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me	53.5671272277832
There is here no question of crime or treason	92.654296875
Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I	119.55976104736328
brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of Madame Henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr	346.23193359375
We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	141.99481201171875
Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption	72.52571868896484
We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	199.86607360839844
Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	51.01060104370117
Monsieur de Mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to General Cromwell instead of King Charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majestya dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son	230.71620178222656
We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home	72.91905975341797
That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted	277.3367004394531
I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the queen	55.86618423461914
In fact I have rarely seen such excess of impudence	147.3177490234375
Your majesty on your side said DArtagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always been	235.9202423095703
You are in error sir answered the queen	64.45670318603516
I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister	54.61429214477539
I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results	92.76556396484375
Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your resolution	75.44661712646484
Well then I will content myself with arresting you	54.478546142578125
Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the parliament	55.16384506225586
It is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left Paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met De Beaufort De Bouillon the coadjutor and DElbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him	128.92176818847656
Your pardon madame I know all that	42.924983978271484
And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to DElbeuf	86.2740249633789
These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain	312.8365478515625
He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body	182.93698120117188
I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign	841.8785400390625
Madame replied DArtagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do so	70.60742950439453
Believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosoma heart devoted to youbelieve that you have been the idol of our lives that we have as you well knowgood Heavenrisked our lives twenty times for your majesty	405.2245178222656
Have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you Look at me madameat me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly	65.86639404296875
What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a moment	39.28459167480469
Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry	71.16392517089844
He has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	73.89447021484375
He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me	80.5001449584961
Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage	36.78971862792969
Consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no other wish than to bless you and who neverthelessno I am wrong your subjects madame will never curse you say one word to them and all will be endedpeace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune	412.22381591796875
Anne of Austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of DArtagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling	91.3136978149414
Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she said	12.192085266113281
Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands	8.0950927734375
And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I see	105.02908325195312
It has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future	141.51536560058594
Then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the Fronde as you propose to deliver my minister	29.192731857299805
We have not thought about it yet madame answered DArtagnan with that Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly	97.78943634033203
I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants	40.226409912109375
Alas madame exclaimed DArtagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of us	78.62211608886719
Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it	133.3990936279297
Your majesty will do us justice	90.84959411621094
In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp	248.22666931152344
You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign	72.7236328125
Where is the treaty	733.469482421875
Here it is	42.350791931152344
Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that DArtagnan presented to her	100.43132781982422
I do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the Prince de Conti or of the Ducs de Beaufort de Bouillon and dElbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours	141.30349731445312
We do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	138.56919860839844
We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names	174.95233154296875
But you I presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce	112.35167694091797
I believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to Saint Germain	30.410886764526367
It is my intention so to do come let us hear you	93.72135925292969
He who has negotiated these matters forgive me if I begin by speaking of myself but I must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers	342.76275634765625
Tis the appointment Monsieur de Trville held you ask of me	1537.5550537109375
The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Trville has left it it has not been filled	55.600582122802734
But it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household	210.71897888183594
Monsieur de Trville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years	134.01895141601562
You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	57.22628402709961
Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow	55.898399353027344
What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	103.30622863769531
A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty	60.27463150024414
Anne hesitated	150.96217346191406
To think of the Parisians soliloquized DArtagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or aliveif alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of Christian burial	28.37921142578125
Come said Anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs	133.7238311767578
Now then she said what next	164.64869689941406
Madame my friend Du Vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but I think I remember that there was a question between him and Monsieur Mazarin as to making his estate a barony	105.53955078125
Nay it must have been a promise	64.37398529052734
A country clown said Anne of Austria people will laugh	73.74061584472656
Let them answered DArtagnan	137.41403198242188
But I am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time	48.20088577270508
Here goes the barony	309.66552734375
said the queen she signed a patent	112.01286315917969
Now there remains the chevalier or the Abb dHerblay as your majesty pleases	199.54296875
Does he wish to be a bishop	43.58736038208008
No madame something easier to grant	21.23813247680664
It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longueville	98.96672821044922
The queen smiled	96.33001708984375
Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said DArtagnan	54.30521774291992
Yes said the queen but his son	106.95096588134766
His son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother is	90.18950653076172
And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville	12.842076301574707
No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of Normandy	139.81690979003906
As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers	67.42084503173828
We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together	99.42455291748047
What next	329.9863586425781
What next madame	91.76319885253906
That is all	81.6323013305664
Have nt you then a fourth companion	173.9239959716797
Yes madame the Comte de la Fere	189.94003295898438
What does he ask	181.30203247070312
There is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing	74.24342346191406
There is the Comte de la Fere madame	104.28142547607422
The Comte de la Fere is not a man	69.28128814697266
What is he then	15.653148651123047
The Comte de la Fere is a demigod	149.3669891357422
Has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom Comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with Monsieur de Chatillon brought the standards from Lens	13.260092735290527
He has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the Vicomte de Bragelonne	67.16907501220703
If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say	33.59004592895508
Perhaps he would accept	52.51301574707031
Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept	65.4460220336914
He must be indeed a strange man	178.9705047607422
Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him	22.86530113220215
Are you satisfied sir	130.3770294189453
There is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the treaty	89.38469696044922
Of what use today I will sign it tomorrow	39.45048904418945
I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign tomorrow	51.466548919677734
Consent then I beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by Mazarin as you see	28.247724533081055
I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Parisians	68.81366729736328
Anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep	97.54810333251953
DArtagnan started on seeing these tears	80.17472076416016
Since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	163.6673583984375
The Gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	290.3577880859375
Madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	24.353425979614258
He begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him	121.92977905273438
He has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen	115.48270416259766
And in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin to your majesty without conditions	69.88763427734375
Behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them	79.21492004394531
And DArtagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	64.48077392578125
There are momentsfor if everything is not good everything in this world is not badin which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion heartarraigning sentiment one of these momentary impulses actuated Anne	242.7945556640625
DArtagnan when he gave way to his own feelingswhich were in accordance with those of the queenhad accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted	20.4459171295166
He was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed	38.884849548339844
You were right sir said Anne	224.00125122070312
I misunderstood you	170.6109161376953
There are the acts signed I deliver them to you without compulsion	38.484405517578125
Go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible	60.34100341796875
Madame faltered DArtagnan tis twenty years agoI have a good memorysince I had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the Hotel de Ville of kissing one of those lovely hands	64.87828826904297
There is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me	73.80489349365234
Madame said DArtagnan rising I have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall bemy life	616.8143920898438
And with this conclusiona way peculiar to himselfhe rose and left the room	89.55052185058594
I never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age	147.92904663085938
In twentyfour hours DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	75.96470642089844
On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	5.108438491821289
Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty	2.000459671020508
Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal	86.04120635986328
Moreover something had been said of a marriage with Mazarins niece	230.10433959960938
The idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one	103.5686264038086
The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	33.00796127319336
Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape	123.80148315429688
He received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the Parliament of Bretagne	15.162671089172363
The Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of Sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house	69.2942123413086
The Duc de Longueville gained the government of PontdelArche five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and Henrietta of England	49.42517852783203
Aramis stipulated that Bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that Planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums	35.78434753417969
The Duc dElbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twentyfive thousand for each of the three others	91.28631591796875
The coadjutor alone obtained nothing	107.8023910522461
They promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and Mazarin	92.04620361328125
Quite contrary to the lot of Monsieur de Conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	67.37690734863281
And therefore when all Paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day Gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wo nt to summon when in especially bad humor	48.79952621459961
Those two men were the Count de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache	63.94200897216797
They came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	138.25364685058594
Chapter LXXXIX	91.11349487304688
Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms	46.769187927246094
Whilst DArtagnan and Porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to Saint Germain Athos and Aramis returned to Paris	40.159515380859375
Each had his own particular visit to make	247.46580505371094
Aramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville where Madame de Longueville was sojourning	23.136690139770508
The duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace	64.07551574707031
War had made her a queen peace brought her abdication	37.95142364501953
She declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war	60.71780014038086
But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true lightthat is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris the viceroyalty of FontdelArche in other words of all Normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font Madame de Longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last	58.596160888671875
Aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	27.96129608154297
Madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brotherthat is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	82.46162414550781
You have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight	51.13776779174805
Now attach him to our party	43.77730941772461
Withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from Mazarin whom he despises	62.82455825805664
The Fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played	59.450042724609375
Let us wait for a dnouementfor the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court	711.2637329101562
Madame de Longueville was persuaded	59.9306640625
This Frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over Monsieur de Cond and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified	63.070838928222656
Athos on quitting Aramis went to Madame de Chevreuse	104.8935546875
Here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival	87.85946655273438
There had been no stipulation in her favor	68.56291198730469
Monsieur de Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter	498.4912109375
At the first announcement of peace Madame de Chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of Athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities	80.06147766113281
My fair friend said Athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war	218.6863555908203
You will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of Louis XIII	134.48338317871094
Believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting Paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there	571.454345703125
Oh cried the duchess I can not make war alone but I can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favoriteon the honor of a duchess I will avenge myself	113.18600463867188
Madame replied Athos do not injure the Vicomte de Bragelonnedo not ruin his prospects	81.81982421875
Alas excuse my weakness There are moments when a man grows young again in his children	50.666133880615234
The duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically	25.19756317138672
Count she said you are I fear gained over to the court	255.02334594726562
I suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket	536.424560546875
Yes madame I have that of the Garter which King Charles I	299.1413879394531
gave me some days before he died	169.79884338378906
Come I am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively	63.2409553527832
Athos took her hand and kissed it	61.85630416870117
She sighed as she looked at him	241.21478271484375
Count she said Bragelonne must be a charming place	152.3793182373047
You are a man of taste	137.48585510253906
You have waterwoodsflowers there	324.07745361328125
She sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color	254.80262756347656
Madame exclaimed Athos what were you saying just now about growing old Never have I seen you look so young so beautiful	198.6395721435547
The duchess shook her head	730.7301025390625
Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris she inquired	154.4254608154297
What think you of it inquired Athos	150.4454803466797
Leave him with me replied the duchess	52.16820526123047
No madame if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus I at least remember it	142.4389190673828
Really sir you are delightful and I should like to spend a month at Bragelonne	42.548118591308594
Are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied Athos	122.98651123046875
No I shall go incognito count under the name of Marie Michon	99.13624572753906
You are adorable madame	990.9522705078125
But do not keep Raoul with you	19.081449508666992
Why not	88.34085083007812
Because he is in love	990.9522705078125
He he is quite a child	77.12003326416016
And tis a child he loves	109.00698852539062
Athos became thoughtful	108.87005615234375
You are right duchess	65.98707580566406
This singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy	41.56499099731445
There is to be war in Flanders	78.68599700927734
He shall go thither	222.7819061279297
And at his return you will send him to me	318.7492370605469
I will arm him against love	120.64564514160156
Alas madame exclaimed Athos today love is like warthe breastplate is becoming useless	397.0189514160156
Raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day	198.60084533691406
The next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit Saint Germain	148.19068908691406
Meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for DArtagnan	49.08688735961914
I hear she said that Paris is not quiet	68.42253875732422
I am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right	19.575063705444336
Reassure yourself madame I will answer for the kings safety	138.43605041503906
As he left the queens presence Bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	42.89836120605469
Sir said Mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in Paris	99.35488891601562
I shall be on the kings left and as I am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left	511.6766357421875
Your eminence may be perfectly easy replied DArtagnan they will not touch a hair of your head	33.849403381347656
Deuce take it he thought to himself how can I take care of both Ah plague ont I will guard the king and Porthos shall guard the cardinal	29.605613708496094
This arrangement pleased every one	85.55958557128906
The queen had confidence in the courage of DArtagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of Porthos which he had experienced	511.6766357421875
The royal procession set out for Paris	172.45115661621094
Guitant and Comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with DArtagnan on one side Porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of DArtagnan	63.44244384765625
During twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before	131.43116760253906
The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame where a Te Deum was chanted	381.0148010253906
All Paris were in the streets	101.75016021728516
The Swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only	233.95005798339844
This force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	100.87201690673828
Whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen Anne looked at DArtagnan anxiously	323.8418884277344
Mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry Long live Mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on Porthos but that gigantic bodyguard replied to the look with his great bass voice Be tranquil my lord and Mazarin became more and more composed	71.57908630371094
At the Palais Royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Honore	263.873291015625
When the procession reached the palace loud cries of Long live their majesties resounded	29.605613708496094
Mazarin leaned out of the window	125.143798828125
One or two shouts of Long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	135.35227966308594
Mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach	106.76412200927734
Lowborn fellows ejaculated Porthos	272.930908203125
DArtagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake	156.55108642578125
Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young kings ear	73.90843200683594
Say something gracious to Monsieur dArtagnan my son	115.1495361328125
The young king leaned toward the door	1365.6439208984375
I have not said goodmorning to you Monsieur dArtagnan he said nevertheless I have remarked you	177.62059020996094
It was you who were behind my bedcurtains that night the Parisians wished to see me asleep	127.08053588867188
And if the king permits me returned the Gascon I shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered	56.92530059814453
Sir said Mazarin to Porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us	278.40753173828125
Kill as many as I could my lord	139.36184692382812
Hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all	112.376220703125
Tis true answered Porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them	106.32466888427734
I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage	133.40182495117188
The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious	69.01033020019531
The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous	229.56874084472656
Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute	272.1408996582031
DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army	97.31102752685547
The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	89.83956146240234
At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to stop	236.7478790283203
Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens carriage	105.41934204101562
Anne questioned DArtagnan by a look	287.8443298339844
He answered in the same language	327.29302978515625
Proceed she said	260.35162353515625
Comminges returned to his post	249.92527770996094
An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through	88.69540405273438
Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister	164.6790771484375
Onward cried DArtagnan in a loud voice	270.4971923828125
Onward cried Porthos	1348.211181640625
But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously	67.9150390625
Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	102.94647216796875
At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthoss horse and that of DArtagnan	199.98056030273438
This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men	346.1406555175781
It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized attack	98.01748657226562
Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman	60.57242965698242
Both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse	1294.330810546875
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage	30.535015106201172
Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing	139.8391876220703
Ho Musketeers cried DArtagnan	604.0234985351562
The escort divided into two files	38.97176742553711
One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left	1264.8651123046875
One went to support DArtagnan the other Porthos	1061.7073974609375
Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting	501.45318603515625
Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable	964.0147705078125
The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way	55.848575592041016
DArtagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying	238.14593505859375
No sir I wish to see everything	1016.53466796875
If your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied DArtagnan	174.37109375
And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers	310.0784912109375
Make room cried DArtagnan	98.12298583984375
Zounds give way	198.1066436767578
At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late	127.16351318359375
The blow was sped by DArtagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	269.817138671875
Ah confound it cried the Gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	992.7314453125
What the devil are you doing here count	252.46844482421875
Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one knee	317.5807800292969
I have already got up again after three stabs from you I shall never rise after this fourth	8241.37890625
Count said DArtagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was you	1644.172607421875
I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me	230.9531707763672
Rochefort extended his hand to DArtagnan who took it	173.72764587402344
The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	51.826866149902344
He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	208.53134155273438
Back people cried DArtagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business here	323.9961853027344
Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall	695.1223754882812
DArtagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the Rue du Coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the Place Saint GermainlAuxerrois and taking the direction of the quays	186.35313415527344
DArtagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as DArtagnan	294.6904602050781
The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower	395.5937194824219
Porthos looked very melancholy	16.39032745361328
What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor	49.08688735961914
But you answered Porthos seem to me agitated	68.42253875732422
There s a reason Zounds I have just killed an old friend	19.575063705444336
Indeed replied Porthos who	9.030622482299805
That poor Count de Rochefort	32.910919189453125
Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me	59.170372009277344
Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood	79.38667297363281
And he said nothing as he died	15.045517921447754
Yes he exclaimed Oh	8.898528099060059
I suppose answered DArtagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much	106.66346740722656
Well sir cried the queen	1.032306432723999
Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road	1.0338774919509888
In fact the procession arrived in safety at Notre Dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a Te Deum	1.022317886352539
As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached Bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir	384.52093505859375
Bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	786.6176147460938
He lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to Heaven and recognized Friquet	326.3934631347656
Well you rascal what is it How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle	65.54668426513672
Monsieur Bazin said Friquet Monsieur Maillardyou know who he is he gives holy water at Saint Eustache	209.65480041503906
Well go on	242.22412109375
Well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head	248.41067504882812
That great giant who was there gave it to him	141.1676025390625
In that case said Bazin he must be pretty sick	79.30494689941406
So sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins	75.75064849853516
And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him	80.58798217773438
To be sure the coadjutor has promised	153.7230224609375
Who told you that	249.1980743408203
Monsieur Maillard himself	413.6438293457031
You have seen him then	80.85861206054688
Certainly I was there when he fell	104.6973648071289
What were you doing there	202.07540893554688
I was shouting Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal The Italian to the gallows Is nt that what you would have me shout	175.80557250976562
Be quiet you rascal said Bazin looking uneasily around	248.88717651367188
So that he told me that poor Monsieur Maillard Go find the coadjutor Friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir	180.0753936767578
Say then Father Bazinthe heir of Monsieur Maillard the giver of holy water at Saint Eustache Hey I shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms All the same I should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it	62.697906494140625
I will tell the coadjutor said Bazin	39.29427719116211
In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	171.75189208984375
He then returned with the same slow step and said	30.415468215942383
Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient	369.5959167480469
Monseigneur will be with him in an hour	389.6205139160156
Good said Friquet my fortune is made	127.21390533447266
By the way said Bazin where was he carried	1439.79833984375
To the tower Saint Jacques la Boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy Friquet started off at the top of his speed	305.47998046875
When the Te Deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well	245.39698791503906
He arrived in time	144.0728759765625
Though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead	54.52838134765625
The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	98.65360260009766
A moment later Friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold	455.2098693847656
The mendicant had kept his word and made Friquet his heir	687.1477661132812
Ah Mother Nanette cried Friquet suffocating ah Mother Nanette	67.54766082763672
He could say no more but though he had nt strength to speak he had enough for action	52.30875778198242
He rushed headlong to the street and like the Greek from Marathon who fell in the square at Athens with his laurel in his hand Friquet reached Councillor Broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	174.66700744628906
Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up Friquet	534.345947265625
In the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal	162.65670776367188
That Monsieur dArtagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king	267.8006591796875
Yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	397.7786560058594
Treat him kindly therefore in the future	148.5549774169922
Captain said the young king to DArtagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner todayyou and your friend the Baron du Vallon	358.76824951171875
That was a great honor for DArtagnan and for Porthos	65.97586822509766
Porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied	105.91358184814453
What was the matter with you baron DArtagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the Palais Royal	208.03286743164062
You seemed at dinner to be anxious about something	88.12602233886719
I was trying said Porthos to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have killed	319.20343017578125
And you could nt remember	53.54635238647461
Well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not	401.0926818847656
Pardieu said Porthos	425.1522521972656
Chapter XC	79.71763610839844
On going home the two friends found a letter from Athos who desired them to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day	255.99464416503906
The friends went to bed early but neither of them slept	287.2559814453125
When we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes	140.34988403320312
The next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him and Aramis in traveling costume	61.5047492980957
What cried Porthos are we all going away then I also have made my preparations this morning	58.61384963989258
Oh heavens yes said Aramis	69.88993072509766
There s nothing to do in Paris now there s no Fronde	57.45732879638672
The Duchess de Longueville has invited me to pass a few days in Normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at Rouen after which if nothing new occurs I shall go and bury myself in my convent at NoisyleSec	855.6031494140625
And I said Athos am returning to Bragelonne	319.37408447265625
You know dear DArtagnan I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman	119.11936950683594
Raoul has no fortune other than I possess poor child and I must take care of it for him since I only lend him my name	84.33450317382812
And Raoulwhat shall you do with him	324.9371643066406
I leave him with you my friend	678.2008666992188
War has broken out in Flanders	859.2501831054688
You shall take him with you there	154.1031951904297
I am afraid that remaining at Blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind	42.5562744140625
Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself	413.84332275390625
Then replied DArtagnan though I shall not have you Athos at all events I shall have that dear fairhaired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear Athos I shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me	265.4929504394531
The four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	242.8566131591797
Then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again	69.73326873779297
DArtagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed	27.282808303833008
On arriving at the Hotel de la Chevrette they found the barons equipage all ready and Mousqueton on his saddle	4478.02197265625
Come DArtagnan said Porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to Pierrefonds to Bracieux or to Du Vallon	481.04925537109375
We will grow old together and talk of our companions	69.59302520751953
No replied DArtagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin I wish to be there I expect to get something by it	497.30224609375
What do you expect to get	175.9252471923828
Why I expect to be made Marechal of France	580.1244506835938
Ha ha cried Porthos who was not completely taken in by DArtagnans Gasconades	132.12400817871094
Come my brother go with me added DArtagnan and I will see that you are made a duke	355.71124267578125
No answered Porthos Mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy	356.3492126464844
To that I can say nothing returned DArtagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron	183.60719299316406
Then heres to our next merry meeting	134.63525390625
Adieu dear captain said Porthos I shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony	381.65228271484375
Yes yes when the campaign is over replied the Gascon	502.8851013183594
His honors equipage is waiting said Mousqueton	450.7841491699219
The two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	121.21195220947266
DArtagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returnedstood stillstruck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed	618.844482421875
I recollect	928.7263793945312
What inquired DArtagnan	155.2750244140625
Who the beggar was that I killed	441.66339111328125
Ah indeed and who was he	223.9686737060547
Twas that low fellow Bonacieux	305.775390625
And Porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined Mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street	459.5585021972656
DArtagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair Madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	317.4227294921875
Madeleine said the Gascon give me your apartment on the first floor now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an appearance nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me one never knows what may happen	88.39073944091797

Chapter 1	22.313522338867188
MarseillesThe Arrival	188.51502990722656
On the 24th of February 1815 the lookout at NotreDame de la Garde signalled the threemaster the Pharaon from Smyrna Trieste and Naples	39.725006103515625
As usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the Chteau dIf got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island	115.05908203125
Immediately and according to custom the ramparts of Fort SaintJean were covered with spectators it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the Pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old Phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city	107.75828552246094
The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands had doubled Pomgue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board	89.13153839111328
However those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor acockbill the jibboom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	279.8793029785156
The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon which he reached as she rounded into La Rserve basin	146.1270751953125
When the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ships bulwarks	450.5901184082031
He was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a ravens wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger	23.60723876953125
Ah is it you Dants cried the man in the skiff	128.14907836914062
What s the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard	36.03583526611328
A great misfortune M	78.77338409423828
Morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere	132.23013305664062
And the cargo inquired the owner eagerly	69.94509887695312
Is all safe M	2624.016357421875
Morrel and I think you will be satisfied on that head	37.25234603881836
But poor Captain Leclere	108.33841705322266
What happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation	96.95818328857422
What happened to the worthy captain	432.145263671875
He died	77.88862609863281
Fell into the sea	217.35049438476562
No sir he died of brainfever in dreadful agony	422.196044921875
Then turning to the crew he said Bear a hand there to take in sail	101.345703125
All hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines	99.27249145507812
The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner	77.74784088134766
And how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation	186.60923767089844
0023 m	75.08427429199219
Alas sir in the most unexpected manner	50.53285217285156
After a long talk with the harbormaster Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind	62.34468460083008
In twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards	124.60444641113281
We performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirtysixpound shot at his head and his heels off El Giglio island	115.88848114013672
We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor	92.49591827392578
It was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the English for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else	104.73656463623047
Why you see Edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young	71.17573547363281
If not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo	62.63990783691406
Is all safe and sound M	19.18585968017578
Morrel take my word for it and I advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the voyage	1.0299056768417358
Then as they were just passing the Round Tower the young man shouted Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker	75.3923110961914
The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manofwar	72.85343933105469
Let goand clue up At this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards	107.44017791748047
Now if you will come on board M	66.91866302490234
Morrel said Dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo M	127.10120391845703
Danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular	61.91886520385742
As for me I must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning	125.88804626464844
The owner did not wait for a second invitation	75.5496826171875
He seized a rope which Dants flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to Danglars who now came towards the owner	380.4389343261719
He was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dants was beloved by them	167.27783203125
Well M	102.40009307861328
Morrel said Danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us	26.17588233947754
Yesyes poor Captain Leclere He was a brave and an honest man	103.0694580078125
And a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel   Son replied Danglars	388.4525451660156
But replied the owner glancing after Dants who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say Danglars to understand his business for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone	16.142072677612305
Yes said Danglars darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate	113.13980865478516
Yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconfident	31.289783477783203
Scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba instead of making for Marseilles direct	27.239137649536133
0025 m	55.83736801147461
As to taking command of the vessel replied Morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs	226.71315002441406
The vessel was in as good condition as I am and as I hope you are M	53.59285354614258
Morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else	153.77566528320312
Dants said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way	78.64784240722656
In a moment sir answered Dants and I m with you	144.62696838378906
Then calling to the crew he said Let go	213.99180603027344
The anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porthole	211.42440795898438
Dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manuvre was completed and then he added Halfmast the colors and square the yards	130.93331909179688
You see said Danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word	48.66099166870117
And so in fact he is said the owner	63.21110916137695
Except your signature and your partners M	30.934059143066406
And why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience	70.7870101928711
A cloud passed over Danglars brow	104.8482894897461
Your pardon M	76.1783218383789
Morrel said Dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and I am at your service	115.67857360839844
You hailed me I think	110.45345306396484
Danglars retreated a step or two	194.3058624267578
I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba	91.67424011230469
I do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere who when dying gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand	85.25068664550781
Then did you see him Edmond	63.405696868896484
The marshal	75.69435119628906
Morrel looked around him and then drawing Dants on one side he said suddenly	38.89646911621094
And how is the emperor	55.651832580566406
Very well as far as I could judge from the sight of him	251.26791381835938
You saw the emperor then	40.6644172668457
He entered the marshals apartment while I was there	414.5636291503906
And you spoke to him	44.6229248046875
Why it was he who spoke to me sir said Dants with a smile	34.064537048339844
And what did he say to you	47.05029296875
Asked me questions about the vessel the time she left Marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo	1487.2501220703125
I believe if she had not been laden and I had been her master he would have bought her	100.61759948730469
But I told him I was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel   Son	1143.162109375
Ah yes he said I know them	109.95318603515625
The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence	77.91793060302734
Pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted	45.486637115478516
And that was Policar Morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain	718.5101928710938
Dants you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes	89.15279388427734
Come come continued he patting Edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right Dants to follow Captain Lecleres instructions and touch at Elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble	330.04364013671875
0027 m	165.94552612304688
How could that bring me into trouble sir asked Dants for I did not even know of what I was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	37.240230560302734
But pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside	35.55244445800781
And the young man went to the gangway	177.33355712890625
As he departed Danglars approached and said	55.405372619628906
Well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at PortoFerrajo	56.02151870727539
Yes most satisfactory my dear Danglars	103.98296356201172
Well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty	91.21443176269531
Dants has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	51.1834602355957
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay	8.191274642944336
Talking of Captain Leclere has not Dants given you a letter from him	146.8094940185547
To menowas there one	82.70380401611328
I believe that besides the packet Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care	81.7421875
Of what packet are you speaking Danglars	45.612239837646484
Why that which Dants left at PortoFerrajo	59.3502311706543
How do you know he had a packet to leave at PortoFerrajo	177.54269409179688
Danglars turned very red	68.0912094116211
I was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dants	143.7084197998047
He did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me	475.8835144042969
Danglars reflected for a moment	108.4217300415039
Then M	46.28345489501953
Morrel I beg of you said he not to say a word to Dants on the subject	12.709128379821777
I may have been mistaken	66.49507141113281
At this moment the young man returned Danglars withdrew	30.988330841064453
Well my dear Dants are you now free inquired the owner	49.2458610534668
Yes sir	49.76224899291992
You have not been long detained	115.05776977539062
I gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom I gave them	282.7624206542969
Then you have nothing more to do here	71.7834243774414
Noeverything is all right now	86.41352081298828
Then you can come and dine with me	93.5174789428711
I really must ask you to excuse me M	71.38725280761719
My first visit is due to my father though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me	361.5021057128906
0029 m	53.939449310302734
Right Dants quite right	84.8841552734375
I always knew you were a good son	62.939693450927734
And inquired Dants with some hesitation do you know how my father is	24.73089027404785
Well I believe my dear Edmond though I have not seen him lately	60.111026763916016
Yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room	149.37860107421875
That proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence	46.91931915283203
Dants smiled	136.7915802001953
My father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from Heaven	7.452408790588379
Well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you	56.412269592285156
I must again excuse myself M	516.7117309570312
Morrel for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay	156.80287170410156
True Dants I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely Mercds	57.28459930419922
Dants blushed	70.00332641601562
Ah ha said the shipowner I am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon	22.443450927734375
Peste Edmond you have a very handsome mistress	31.276926040649414
She is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed	21.41588020324707
Sometimes one and the same thing said Morrel with a smile	80.52605438232422
Not with us sir replied Dants	59.4090690612793
Well well my dear Edmond continued the owner do nt let me detain you	327.8938293457031
You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own	63.22829055786133
Do you want any money	1.0371907949447632
No sir I have all my pay to takenearly three months wages	371.9075927734375
You are a careful fellow Edmond	304.4084777832031
Say I have a poor father sir	77.86827850341797
Yes yes I know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	116.28559112548828
I have a son too and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage	256.826171875
Then I have your leave sir	107.0291748046875
Yes if you have nothing more to say to me	78.46617126464844
Captain Leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me	29.701801300048828
He was unable to write sir	22.525238037109375
But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days	27.892656326293945
To get married	324.8312072753906
Yes first and then to go to Paris	55.99494552612305
Very good have what time you require Dants	67.9969253540039
It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we can not get you ready for sea until three months after that only be back again in three months for the Pharaon added the owner patting the young sailor on the back can not sail without her captain	96.43585968017578
Without her captain cried Dants his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart	28.205772399902344
Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon	38.31624984741211
If I were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear Dants and call it settled but I have a partner and you know the Italian proverbChi ha compagno ha padroneHe who has a partner has a master	154.6310272216797
But the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes	42.42705535888672
Rely on me to procure you the other I will do my best	89.11296844482422
Ah M	95.4176254272461
Morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand M	40.084068298339844
Morrel I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercds	57.228248596191406
That s all right Edmond	235.52684020996094
There s a providence that watches over the deserving	34.612701416015625
Go to your father go and see Mercds and afterwards come to me	60.18490982055664
Shall I row you ashore	56.30842590332031
No thank you I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars	83.50908660888672
Have you been satisfied with him this voyage	55.095314025878906
That is according to the sense you attach to the question sir	35.097740173339844
Do you mean is he a good comrade No for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the disputea proposition which I was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse	223.21595764160156
If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question I believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty	118.33285522460938
But tell me Dants if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain	45.79994583129883
Captain or mate M	26.818241119384766
Morrel I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence	113.1952896118164
That s right that s right Dants I see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer	56.37355041503906
Go for I see how impatient you are	1009.4688110351562
Then I have leave	49.07986068725586
Go I tell you	19.895057678222656
May I have the use of your skiff	32.09230422973633
Then for the present M	275.5008850097656
Morrel farewell and a thousand thanks	1610.991943359375
I hope soon to see you again my dear Edmond	53.678260803222656
Good luck to you	717.7257080078125
The young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebire	32.39744567871094
The two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai dOrlans	53.329505920410156
The shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five oclock in the morning until nine oclock at night swarms in the famous street of La Canebirea street of which the modern Phocens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said If Paris had La Canebire Paris would be a second Marseilles	118.44807434082031
On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailorbut there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dants	96.66983795166016
Chapter 2	483.5718994140625
Father and Son	52.334712982177734
We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow Dants who after having traversed La Canebire took the Rue de Noailles and entering a small house on the left of the Alles de Meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a halfopen door from which he could see the whole of a small room	352.7625427246094
This room was occupied by Dants father	165.476318359375
The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window	59.82638931274414
Suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a wellknown voice behind him exclaimed Fatherdear father	88.42369842529297
The old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling	51.05009460449219
What ails you my dearest father Are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed	18.67271614074707
No no my dear Edmondmy boymy sonno but I did not expect you and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyAh I feel as if I were going to die	81.82150268554688
Come come cheer up my dear father Tis Ireally I They say joy never hurts and so I came to you without any warning	107.0774154663086
Come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly	79.5105972290039
Here I am back again and we are going to be happy	449.2762145996094
Yes yes my boy so we willso we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy Shall you never leave me again Come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you	64.13294982910156
God forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but Heaven knows I did not seek this good fortune it has happened and I really can not pretend to lament it	64.09886169433594
The good Captain Leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of M	136.6146697998047
Morrel I shall have his place	97.76692199707031
Do you understand father Only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for	103.14080047607422
Yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate	37.76055908203125
Well then with the first money I touch I mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle	589.4182739257812
But what ails you father Are you not well	103.9936294555664
Tis nothing nothing it will soon pass awayand as he said so the old mans strength failed him and he fell backwards	56.12801742553711
Come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you	397.48095703125
Where do you keep your wine	29.03211212158203
No no thanks	96.38574981689453
You need not look for it I do not want it said the old man	72.41524505615234
Yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards	88.62589263916016
It is no use said the old man there is no wine	48.276065826416016
What no wine said Dants turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards	1296.7740478515625
What no wine Have you wanted money father	390.0125427246094
I want nothing now that I have you said the old man	29.96947479248047
Yet stammered Dants wiping the perspiration from his browyet I gave you two hundred francs when I left three months ago	112.3247299194336
Yes yes Edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor Caderousse	1.0289666652679443
He reminded me of it telling me if I did not pay for you he would be paid by M	93.2581787109375
Morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury	254.09817504882812
Why I paid him	5.532592296600342
But cried Dants it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse	56.659454345703125
Yes stammered the old man	1.0199614763259888
And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you	79.69320678710938
The old man nodded	74.38981628417969
So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered Edmond	81.90398406982422
You know how little I require said the old man	80.65556335449219
Heaven pardon me cried Edmond falling on his knees before his father	64.39212799072266
What are you doing	80.31717681884766
You have wounded me to the heart	111.55567932128906
Never mind it for I see you once more said the old man and now its all overeverything is all right again	73.94322204589844
0035 m	64.38976287841797
Yes here I am said the young man with a promising future and a little money	43.18315505981445
Here father here he said take thistake it and send for something immediately	111.20795440673828
And he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six fivefranc pieces and some smaller coin	109.11759948730469
The countenance of old Dants brightened	134.67466735839844
Whom does this belong to he inquired	336.7991027832031
To me to you to us Take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more	148.2774200439453
Gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave I will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that I had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them	63.24077224731445
Do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father	56.70648193359375
I will not have you left alone so long	78.38497924804688
I have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	45.3416862487793
But hush here comes somebody	50.275360107421875
Tis Caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return	56.39435577392578
Ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured Edmond	33.95487976074219
But never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome	113.00598907470703
As Edmond paused the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door	103.04238891601562
He was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coatlining	81.89410400390625
What is it you Edmond back again said he with a broad Marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivorywhite teeth	209.90545654296875
Yes as you see neighbor Caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied Dants but illconcealing his coldness under this cloak of civility	100.1514663696289
Thanksthanks but fortunately I do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me	1.0224659442901611
Dants made a gesture	103.31465148925781
I do not allude to you my boy	79.96094512939453
Nono I lent you money and you returned it that s like good neighbors and we are quits	95.9638442993164
We are never quits with those who oblige us was Dants reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude	348.01025390625
What s the use of mentioning that What is done is done	147.68934631347656
Let us talk of your happy return my boy	89.9187240600586
I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when I met friend Danglars	123.91854858398438
You at MarseillesYes says he	69.27769470214844
I thought you were at Smyrna	105.92862701416016
I was but am now back again	106.67048645019531
And where is the dear boy our little Edmond	88.00373840332031
Why with his father no doubt replied Danglars	49.37740707397461
And so I came added Caderousse as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend	3.0082876682281494
0037 m	82.18083953857422
Worthy Caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us	229.67483520507812
Yes to be sure I am	40.460208892822266
I love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	59.7646598815918
But it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dants had thrown on the table	293.7198181152344
The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	85.41520690917969
Eh he said negligently this money is not mine	58.79719924926758
I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table	67.1206283569336
Come father added Dants put this money back in your boxunless neighbor Caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service	162.37586975097656
No my boy no said Caderousse	12.946242332458496
I am not in any want thank God my living is suited to my means	57.013614654541016
Keep your moneykeep it I sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it	212.82522583007812
It was offered with good will said Dants	133.86489868164062
No doubt my boy no doubt	49.15884017944336
Well you stand well with M	72.22378540039062
Morrel I hearyou insinuating dog you	59.69451141357422
Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied Dants	17.121713638305664
Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him	22.427574157714844
What did you refuse to dine with him said old Dants and did he invite you to dine	59.540771484375
Yes my dear father replied Edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	13.07866096496582
And why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	263.123046875
That I might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	130.88343811035156
I was most anxious to see you	16.13510513305664
But it must have vexed M	45.51927947998047
Morrel good worthy man said Caderousse	49.723976135253906
And when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner	52.68187713623047
But I explained to him the cause of my refusal replied Dants and I hope he fully understood it	150.8882598876953
Yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons	43.31003952026367
I hope to be captain without that said Dants	46.85374069213867
So much the betterso much the better Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it	59.733665466308594
Mercds said the old man	26.88308334350586
Yes my dear father and with your permission now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans	62.498958587646484
Go my dear boy said old Dants and Heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son	769.2509155273438
His wife said Caderousse why how fast you go on father Dants she is not his wife yet as it seems to me	1145.3282470703125
No but according to all probability she soon will be replied Edmond	216.8159637451172
Yesyes said Caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy	91.28035736083984
And why	90.37983703613281
Because Mercds is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens	87.66934204101562
Really answered Edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	33.715911865234375
0039 m	323.9848937988281
Ah yes continued Caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then	66.77942657470703
Meaning to say replied Dants with a smile which but illconcealed his trouble that if I were not a captain	49.01505661010742
Eheh said Caderousse shaking his head	100.72801208496094
Come come said the sailor I have a better opinion than you of women in general and of Mercds in particular and I am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me	53.219879150390625
So much the betterso much the better said Caderousse	34.32770919799805
When one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my boygo and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects	61.23564147949219
I will go directly was Edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to Caderousse he left the apartment	108.46195220947266
Caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old Dants he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Senac	196.30055236816406
Well said Danglars did you see him	143.3173828125
I have just left him answered Caderousse	115.33092498779297
Did he allude to his hope of being captain	320.6546630859375
He spoke of it as a thing already decided	454.4425354003906
Indeed said Danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me	1.0167518854141235
Why it seems M	178.11642456054688
Morrel has promised him the thing	93.36140441894531
So that he is quite elated about it	67.2879409790039
Why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker	140.90713500976562
Which you refused	132.88568115234375
Most assuredly although I might easily have accepted it for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now M	50.34055709838867
Dants has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a captain	111.68623352050781
Pooh said Danglars he is not one yet	71.45999908447266
Ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered Caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him	209.77899169921875
If we choose replied Danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is	113.02232360839844
What do you mean	48.46003341674805
NothingI was speaking to myself	72.27297973632812
And is he still in love with the Catalane	94.21221923828125
Over head and ears but unless I am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter	77.09944915771484
0041 m	104.01956176757812
Explain yourself	397.1885986328125
Why should I	102.11971282958984
It is more important than you think perhaps	55.86205291748047
You do not like Dants	243.4915771484375
I never like upstarts	41.91205596923828
Then tell me all you know about the Catalane	57.20331573486328
I know nothing for certain only I have seen things which induce me to believe as I told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries	51.673091888427734
What have you seencome tell me	92.63287353515625
Well every time I have seen Mercds come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed Catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin	74.1758041381836
Really and you think this cousin pays her attentions	134.7820281982422
I only suppose so	79.22123718261719
What else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen	137.77061462402344
And you say that Dants has gone to the Catalans	164.0149383544922
He went before I came down	61.941871643066406
Let us go the same way we will stop at La Rserve and we can drink a glass of La Malgue whilst we wait for news	87.49331665039062
Come along said Caderousse but you pay the score	78.95773315429688
Of course replied Danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses	110.08202362060547
Pre Pamphile had seen Dants pass not ten minutes before and assured that he was at the Catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring	68.7874526977539
Chapter 3	22.579103469848633
The Catalans	43.81874465942383
Beyond a bare weatherworn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the Catalans	36.86018371582031
Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day	222.8653106689453
Whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue	100.33678436279297
One of its chiefs who understood Provenal begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore	107.58686065673828
The request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up	1.0444544553756714
This village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half Moorish half Spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers	65.29456329345703
For three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the Marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mothercountry as they have preserved its language	75.03287506103516
Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful deadleaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a Spanish posada	451.1230163574219
A young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelles was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her wellturned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking	55.439491271972656
At three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old wormeaten table was a tall young man of twenty or twoandtwenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled	278.9066162109375
He questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	97.39263916015625
You see Mercds said the young man here is Easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding	148.21534729003906
I have answered you a hundred times Fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again	248.471923828125
Well repeat itrepeat it I beg of you that I may at last believe it Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers sanction	93.28868865966797
Make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you	30.795804977416992
Ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband Mercds and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence	120.56001281738281
At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope Fernand replied Mercds you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry	64.18936920166016
I have always said to you I love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is anothers	157.08432006835938
Is not this true Fernand	86.80928802490234
Yes that is very true Mercds replied the young man Yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry	278.9449157714844
0045 m	57.09370803833008
You mistake Fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and I pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor	170.58978271484375
You are included in the conscription Fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms	294.1039733886719
Once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a halfruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me She has been dead a year and you know Fernand I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity	66.65596008300781
Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and I accept it Fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse	176.29978942871094
But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spinI feel very keenly Fernand that this is charity	75.68832397460938
And if it were Mercds poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can I look for these better than in you	58.886539459228516
Fernand answered Mercds shaking her head a woman becomes a bad manager and who shall say she will remain an honest woman when she loves another man better than her husband Rest content with my friendship for I say once more that is all I can promise and I will promise no more than I can bestow	204.9097137451172
I understand replied Fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine	118.89913177490234
Well Mercds beloved by you I would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and I should become rich	124.74879455566406
I could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself	180.19117736816406
You could do no such thing Fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as I can not give you more	105.4175796508789
Well I will do better Mercds	1.0167773962020874
I will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise I will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons	84.39126586914062
Would not that dress please you	86.31950378417969
What do you mean asked Mercds with an angry glancewhat do you mean I do not understand you	71.25904083251953
I mean Mercds that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him	53.67233657836914
Fernand cried Mercds I believed you were goodhearted and I was mistaken Fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of God Yes I will not deny it I do await and I do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate I will tell you that he died loving me and me only	8548.6513671875
The young girl made a gesture of rage	59.82284927368164
I understand you Fernand you would be revenged on him because I do not love you you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk	67.47673797607422
What end would that answer To lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	78.51197814941406
Believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man	107.76974487304688
No Fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts	91.1894302368164
Unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait Fernand you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms	471.88726806640625
Fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of Mercds although for each of these tears he would have shed his hearts blood but these tears flowed for another	136.92764282226562
He arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before Mercds with his eyes glowing and his hands clenchedSay Mercds he said once for all is this your final determination	177.2163848876953
I love Edmond Dants the young girl calmly replied and none but Edmond shall ever be my husband	49.61867141723633
And you will always love him	56.1136474609375
As long as I live	49.587581634521484
Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils saidBut if he is dead	269.8463439941406
If he is dead I shall die too	55.37856674194336
If he has forgotten you	396.83233642578125
Mercds called a joyous voice from withoutMercds	137.71713256835938
Ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is And rushing towards the door she opened it saying Here Edmond here I am	280.2221984863281
Fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him	66.7565689086914
Edmond and Mercds were clasped in each others arms	236.58851623535156
The burning Marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light	698.31298828125
At first they saw nothing around them	29.88795280456543
Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	1.015392541885376
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of Fernand as it was defined in the shadow	86.0544204711914
By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt	39.1438102722168
Ah your pardon said Dants frowning in his turn I did not perceive that there were three of us	113.46808624267578
Then turning to Mercds he inquired Who is this gentleman	803.9925537109375
One who will be your best friend Dants for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is Fernandthe man whom after you Edmond I love the best in the world	74.47445678710938
Do you not remember him	54.90169143676758
Yes said Dants and without relinquishing Mercds hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air	98.57064819335938
But Fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	99.81149291992188
Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercds and then again on the gloomy and menacing Fernand	26.685306549072266
This look told him all and his anger waxed hot	117.640625
I did not know when I came with such haste to you that I was to meet an enemy here	72.1910400390625
An enemy cried Mercds with an angry look at her cousin	206.37722778320312
An enemy in my house do you say Edmond If I believed that I would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more	1.013521432876587
Fernands eye darted lightning	120.84313201904297
And should any misfortune occur to you dear Edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you I would ascend the highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from it	46.94046401977539
Fernand became deadly pale	69.5317611694336
But you are deceived Edmond she continued	41.02667236328125
You have no enemy herethere is no one but Fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend	137.237548828125
And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards Edmond and offered him his hand	165.2977752685547
His hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercds exercised over him	93.22856903076172
Scarcely however had he touched Edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	104.82894897460938
Oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairOh who will deliver me from this man Wretchedwretched that I am	182.55697631835938
Hallo Catalan Hallo Fernand where are you running to exclaimed a voice	262.26812744140625
The young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars under an arbor	75.70513916015625
Well said Caderousse why do nt you come Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends	23.213302612304688
Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added Danglars	47.444740295410156
Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word	114.73829650878906
He seems besotted said Danglars pushing Caderousse with his knee	151.79437255859375
Are we mistaken and is Dants triumphant in spite of all we have believed	152.00869750976562
Why we must inquire into that was Caderousses reply and turning towards the young man said Well Catalan ca nt you make up your mind	191.46499633789062
Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body	1132.3836669921875
Goodday said he	174.46249389648438
You called me did nt you And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	75.96424102783203
I called you because you were running like a madman and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said Caderousse laughing	75.89131927490234
Why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily	72.62410736083984
Fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table	131.22401428222656
Well Fernand I must say said Caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	69.18714141845703
Bah said Danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love	84.1530990600586
You are laughing at him Caderousse	64.8738021850586
No he replied only hark how he sighs Come come Fernand said Caderousse hold up your head and answer us	416.98211669921875
Its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health	193.84768676757812
My health is well enough said Fernand clenching his hands without raising his head	169.94747924804688
Ah you see Danglars said Caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is Fernand whom you see here is a good and brave Catalan one of the best fishermen in Marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named Mercds but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon and as the Pharaon arrived todaywhy you understand	64.80126953125
No I do not understand said Danglars	98.39202117919922
Poor Fernand has been dismissed continued Caderousse	69.42561340332031
Well and what then said Fernand lifting up his head and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger Mercds is not accountable to any person is she Is she not free to love whomsoever she will	396.0232849121094
Oh if you take it in that sense said Caderousse it is another thing	643.9357299804688
But I thought you were a Catalan and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival	8174.74853515625
It was even told me that Fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance	82.97184753417969
Fernand smiled piteously	32.672340393066406
A lover is never terrible he said	33.56513977050781
Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	314.5790710449219
Why you see he did not expect to see Dants return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly	133.73321533203125
Ah ma foi under any circumstances said Caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effectunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dants is he Danglars	143.3901824951172
No you are rightand I should say that would bring him illluck	185.66070556640625
Well never mind answered Caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while Danglars had merely sipped his	352.62213134765625
Never mindin the meantime he marries Mercdsthe lovely Mercdsat least he returns to do that	193.87301635742188
During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart Caderousses words fell like molten lead	98.75883483886719
And when is the wedding to be he asked	84.26818084716797
Oh it is not yet fixed murmured Fernand	77.90741729736328
No but it will be said Caderousse as surely as Dants will be captain of the Pharaoneh Danglars	188.60601806640625
Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to Caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness	47.61903762817383
Well said he filling the glasses let us drink to Captain Edmond Dants husband of the beautiful Catalane	73.85016632080078
Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp	199.63870239257812
Fernand dashed his on the ground	233.5925750732422
Eh eh eh stammered Caderousse	159.7718963623047
What do I see down there by the wall in the direction of the Catalans Look Fernand your eyes are better than mine	177.5194091796875
I believe I see double	15.44366455078125
You know wine is a deceiver but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand	49.668846130371094
Heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing	96.13646697998047
Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured	7.268324851989746
Do you know them Fernand he said	90.33692169189453
Yes was the reply in a low voice	62.48039627075195
It is Edmond and Mercds	45.07024383544922
Ah see there now said Caderousse and I did not recognize them Hallo Dants hello lovely damsel Come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us	201.525390625
Hold your tongue will you said Danglars pretending to restrain Caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor	94.40617370605469
Try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption	52.26072692871094
See look at Fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved	110.11148071289062
0051 m	86.41178894042969
Fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by Danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when Mercds smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	66.23933410644531
At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat	28.420236587524414
Danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love	486.27032470703125
I shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward	1.0146492719650269
Heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby	134.00047302246094
Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards Sicilians and Calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow	104.68228912353516
Unquestionably Edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessa sinister smile passed over Danglars lipsunless I take a hand in the affair he added	107.93179321289062
Hallo continued Caderousse halfrising and with his fist on the table hallo Edmond do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them	147.73358154296875
No my dear fellow replied Dants I am not proud but I am happy and happiness blinds I think more than pride	108.50546264648438
Ah very well that s an explanation said Caderousse	64.36814880371094
How do you do Madame Dants	51.830562591552734
Mercds courtesied gravely and saidThat is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband	29.33462905883789
So call me Mercds if you please	133.6551055908203
We must excuse our worthy neighbor Caderousse said Dants he is so easily mistaken	38.39752960205078
So then the wedding is to take place immediately M	107.17303466796875
Dants said Danglars bowing to the young couple	191.14834594726562
As soon as possible M	4.772528171539307
Danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at La Rserve	198.42941284179688
My friends will be there I hope that is to say you are invited M	2049.10888671875
Danglars and you Caderousse	89.01991271972656
And Fernand said Caderousse with a chuckle Fernand too is invited	58.86957931518555
My wifes brother is my brother said Edmond and we Mercds and I should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time	37.807106018066406
Fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word	36.30883026123047
Today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony You are in a hurry captain	64.13044738769531
Danglars said Edmond smiling I will say to you as Mercds said just now to Caderousse Do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck	100.08104705810547
Your pardon replied Danglars I merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the Pharaon can not be under weigh again in less than three months	483.8171081542969
We are always in a hurry to be happy M	126.48119354248047
Danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune	198.68115234375
But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste I must go to Paris	88.6475830078125
Ah reallyto Paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there Dants	34.91908645629883
Have you business there	54.77249526977539
Not of my own the last commission of poor Captain Leclere you know to what I allude Danglarsit is sacred	107.7905044555664
Besides I shall only take the time to go and return	59.66875457763672
Yes yes I understand said Danglars and then in a low tone he added To Paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him	150.51121520996094
Ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea Ah Dants my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon then turning towards Edmond who was walking away A pleasant journey he cried	73.23545837402344
Thank you said Edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven	240.93775939941406
Chapter 4	41.0516357421875
Danglars followed Edmond and Mercds with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas then turning round he perceived Fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinkingsong	206.18080139160156
Well my dear sir said Danglars to Fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy	104.64280700683594
It drives me to despair said Fernand	70.68080139160156
Do you then love Mercds	318.79986572265625
I adore her	18.806560516357422
For long	103.11601257324219
As long as I have known heralways	177.62747192382812
And you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition I did not think that was the way of your people	137.12490844726562
What would you have me do said Fernand	56.32324981689453
How do I know Is it my affair I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercds but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find	40.489112854003906
I have found already	113.12740325927734
I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself	75.07650756835938
Pooh Women say those things but never do them	114.96782684326172
You do not know Mercds what she threatens she will do	152.4541015625
Idiot muttered Danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided Dants is not captain	56.47707748413086
Before Mercds should die replied Fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution I would die myself	66.84799194335938
That s what I call love said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever	101.33806610107422
That s love or I do nt know what love is	56.61907196044922
Come said Danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me I should like to help you but	155.52542114257812
Yes said Caderousse but how	55.25614929199219
My dear fellow replied Danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so	58.733848571777344
Drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool judgment	23.841733932495117
Idrunk said Caderousse well that s a good one I could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks	717.4567260742188
Pre Pamphile more wine	198.09654235839844
And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	43.030860900878906
You were saying sir said Fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark	74.43473815917969
What was I saying I forget	168.31927490234375
This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence	97.45502471923828
Drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and Caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time	263.9516906738281
Tous les mchants sont buveurs deau	585.3980102539062
Cest bien prouv par le dluge	33.928245544433594
You said sir you would like to help me but	22.37251853942871
Yes but I added to help you it would be sufficient that Dants did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet Dants need not die	164.7735137939453
Death alone can separate them remarked Fernand	273.94854736328125
You talk like a noodle my friend said Caderousse and here is Danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong	62.17852020263672
Prove it Danglars	26.340787887573242
I have answered for you	44.487571716308594
Say there is no need why Dants should die it would indeed be a pity he should	80.8188705444336
Dants is a good fellow I like Dants	214.47396850585938
Dants your health	90.689453125
Fernand rose impatiently	97.75013732910156
Let him run on said Danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says	104.08247375488281
Absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercds they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone	50.8454704284668
0056 m	154.10311889648438
Yes but one gets out of prison said Caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and ones name is Edmond Dants one seeks revenge	1.0454856157302856
What matters that muttered Fernand	40.959022521972656
And why I should like to know persisted Caderousse should they put Dants in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered	129.56329345703125
Hold your tongue said Danglars	43.76950454711914
I wo nt hold my tongue replied Caderousse I say I want to know why they should put Dants in prison I like Dants Dants your health and he swallowed another glass of wine	262.6991882324219
0057 m	63.10425567626953
Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards Fernand said Well you understand there is no need to kill him	254.85122680664062
Certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having Dants arrested	1.0184597969055176
Have you that means	172.00653076171875
It is to be found for the searching	239.7388916015625
But why should I meddle in the matter it is no affair of mine	76.15319061279297
I know not why you meddle said Fernand seizing his arm but this I know you have some motive of personal hatred against Dants for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others	109.65719604492188
I motives of hatred against Dants None on my word I saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me that s all but since you believe I act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart	36.983001708984375
No no said Fernand restraining him stay It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dants	59.37950134277344
I hate him I confess it openly	37.90031051635742
Do you find the means I will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for Mercds has declared she will kill herself if Dants is killed	96.05531311035156
Caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said Kill Dants who talks of killing Dants I wo nt have him killedI wo nt He s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as I shared mine with him	43.00722122192383
I wo nt have Dants killedI wo nt	71.51290893554688
And who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied Danglars	375.2792663574219
We were merely joking drink to his health he added filling Caderousses glass and do not interfere with us	208.40380859375
Yes yes Dants good health said Caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah	183.02049255371094
But the meansthe means said Fernand	142.44137573242188
Have you not hit upon any asked Danglars	146.7512664794922
Noyou undertook to do so	126.65555572509766
True replied Danglars the French have the superiority over the Spaniards that the Spaniards ruminate while the French invent	80.76813507080078
Do you invent then said Fernand impatiently	89.73158264160156
Waiter said Danglars pen ink and paper	651.4883422851562
Pen ink and paper muttered Fernand	48.697540283203125
Yes I am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools I am fit for nothing	445.7178649902344
Pen ink and paper then called Fernand loudly	98.06517791748047
There s what you want on that table said the waiter	1.0092880725860596
Bring them here	60.02678680419922
The waiter did as he was desired	20.701642990112305
0059 m	75.0351333618164
When one thinks said Caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him I have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol	287.04962158203125
The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said Danglars	46.992164611816406
Give him some more wine Fernand	76.550537109375
Fernand filled Caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass	112.85499572753906
The Catalan watched him until Caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table	81.51622772216797
Well resumed the Catalan as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of wine	70.43193054199219
Well then I should say for instance resumed Danglars that if after a voyage such as Dants has just made in which he touched at the Island of Elba someone were to denounce him to the kings procureur as a Bonapartist agent	44.80432891845703
I will denounce him exclaimed the young man hastily	58.651092529296875
Yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for I know the fact well	2.9005866050720215
But Dants can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration	79.59032440185547
Oh I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me	42.53098678588867
Yes and Mercds Mercds who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond	118.16002655029297
True said Fernand	1.0454856157302856
No no continued Danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as I now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose	90.60961151123047
And Danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to Fernand and which Fernand read in an undertone	72.6038818359375
The honorable the kings attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants mate of the ship Pharaon arrived this morning from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris	62.2404899597168
Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the Pharaon	235.8326416015625
Very good resumed Danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing and write upon it To the kings attorney and that s all settled	73.32313537597656
And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke	165.57687377929688
Yes and that s all settled exclaimed Caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail	278.50274658203125
Yes and that s all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	185.26504516601562
Yes said Danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what I say and do is merely in jest and I amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to Dantsthe worthy Dantslook here And taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor	54.43832015991211
All right said Caderousse	61.24443054199219
Dants is my friend and I wo nt have him illused	120.88421630859375
And who thinks of using him ill Certainly neither I nor Fernand said Danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner	1001.7109985351562
In this case replied Caderousse lets have some more wine	219.6704559326172
I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercds	385.52301025390625
You have had too much already drunkard said Danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs	3575.50244140625
I said Caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man I ca nt keep on my legs Why Ill wager I can go up into the belfry of the Accoules and without staggering too	58.17429733276367
Done said Danglars Ill take your bet but tomorrowtoday it is time to return	114.3853530883789
Give me your arm and let us go	104.10153198242188
Very well let us go said Caderousse but I do nt want your arm at all	1363.59228515625
Come Fernand wo nt you return to Marseilles with us	62.92232131958008
No said Fernand I shall return to the Catalans	41.264976501464844
You re wrong	111.49016571044922
Come with us to Marseillescome along	58.87657165527344
I will not	194.8787384033203
What do you mean you will not Well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world	163.69622802734375
Come along Danglars and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses	179.2447509765625
Danglars took advantage of Caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte SaintVictor staggering as he went	116.0427017211914
When they had advanced about twenty yards Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon	219.67767333984375
Well said Caderousse why what a lie he told He said he was going to the Catalans and he is going to the city	120.73957061767578
Hallo Fernand You are coming my boy	213.35968017578125
Oh you do nt see straight said Danglars he s gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries	123.78170776367188
Well said Caderousse I should have sworn that he turned to the righthow treacherous wine is	46.91411590576172
Come come said Danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted	74.15182495117188
Chapter 5	40.61453628540039
The Marriage Feast	188.5564727783203
The mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted light	128.53334045410156
The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Rserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar	85.24593353271484
The apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of France beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	55.40566635131836
And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve oclock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion	70.49099731445312
Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended	46.77311325073242
Danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by Caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with M	105.56144714355469
Morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Rserve	81.52890014648438
In fact a moment later M	53.14347457885742
Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as Dants was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	293.9624938964844
With the entrance of M	102.81902313232422
Morrel Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste	16.340229034423828
Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked Dants father the whole brought up by Fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile	152.41964721679688
Neither Mercds nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	13.654022216796875
Having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantsthe latter of whom attracted universal notice	361.6169128417969
The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	395.0834045410156
His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of English manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	61.43914794921875
Thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries	98.82733154296875
Beside him glided Caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dants father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream	1.0183817148208618
0065 m	28.882619857788086
As Danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while Fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of Marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	125.13335418701172
Dants himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined	24.70960235595703
Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios Mercds boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips	86.50929260253906
She moved with the light free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian	83.59082794189453
One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say If you are my friends rejoice with me for I am very happy	60.73659133911133
As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Rserve M	52.97605514526367
Morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that Dants should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere	127.42021179199219
Edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M	30.341779708862305
Morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes	41.303443908691406
Father said Mercds stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit I pray you on my right hand on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart	136.19805908203125
During this time Dants at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests	349.72418212890625
Morrel was seated at his right hand Danglars at his left while at a sign from Edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable	153.30210876464844
Then they began to pass around the dusky piquant Arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster North	233.10665893554688
All the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea	312.9029235839844
A pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before Mercds herself	113.47830963134766
Now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away	123.07949829101562
Ah sighed Caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married	342.7076721191406
The truth is replied Dants that I am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow	52.021793365478516
Danglars looked towards Fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	77.4424819946289
Why what ails you asked he of Edmond	35.0838508605957
Do you fear any approaching evil I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant	51.37997817993164
And that is the very thing that alarms me returned Dants	74.64397430419922
Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours	100.93595123291016
I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of Mercds	1.0135148763656616
Nay nay cried Caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	266.582763671875
Mercds is not yet your wife	120.03480529785156
Just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come	972.4701538085938
The bride blushed while Fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow	344.6405944824219
Well never mind that neighbor Caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that	90.77316284179688
Tis true that Mercds is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be	59.207401275634766
A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder Dants whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth	23.645160675048828
Mercds looked pleased and gratified while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	61.59232711791992
In an hour inquired Danglars turning pale	292.3738708496094
How is that my friend	27.790220260620117
Why thus it is replied Dants	81.86017608642578
Thanks to the influence of M	75.47097778320312
Morrel to whom next to my father I owe every blessing I enjoy every difficulty has been removed	193.51991271972656
We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall	44.24228286743164
Now as a quarterpast one has already struck I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes Mercds will have become Madame Dants	160.65565490722656
0069 m	74.87112426757812
Fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	471.2558898925781
Upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair	218.88375854492188
Arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three oclock Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work	119.37069702148438
But asked Danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalitiesthe contractthe settlement	32.32854080200195
The contract answered Dants laughingly it did nt take long to fix that	148.2515411376953
Mercds has no fortune I have none to settle on her	87.24143981933594
So you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive	1859.4439697265625
This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause	4580.14208984375
So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said Danglars	103.83522033691406
No no answered Dants do nt imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner	49.04084396362305
Tomorrow morning I start for Paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time I shall be absent	92.52696990966797
I shall be back here by the first of March and on the second I give my real marriage feast	1759.7794189453125
This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder Dants who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	156.77101135253906
Dants perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while Mercds glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond	86.5753173828125
Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette	146.5841064453125
Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions	39.78520202636719
Everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts	198.09361267089844
Fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars	340.0129699707031
As for Fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	117.0344009399414
Caderousse approached him just as Danglars whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room	155.39405822753906
Upon my word said Caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dants united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dants good fortuneupon my word Dants is a downright good fellow and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be	28.910947799682617
I can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday	1895.5189208984375
Oh there was no harm meant answered Danglars at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants I knew there was no further cause for apprehension	45.796451568603516
Caderousse looked full at Fernandhe was ghastly pale	10.952274322509766
Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned	366.141845703125
Upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog Gad I only wish he would let me take his place	14.330252647399902
Shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of Mercds two oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour	243.93922424316406
0071 m	25.711692810058594
To be sureto be sure cried Dants eagerly quitting the table let us go directly	55.05242919921875
His words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers	36.602088928222656
At this moment Danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	185.26504516601562
At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	62.4011344909668
The sounds drew nearer	60.86099624633789
Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door	126.6727066040039
The company looked at each other in consternation	54.47505187988281
I demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law As no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal	20.372901916503906
Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	55.83073806762695
May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said M	168.73570251464844
Morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily explained	67.6607437133789
If it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile I am the bearer of an order of arrest and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled	137.49667358398438
Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dants	60.96137619018555
Every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice	462.9398498535156
I am he what is your pleasure with me	115.82008361816406
Edmond Dants replied the magistrate I arrest you in the name of the law	152.48318481445312
Me repeated Edmond slightly changing color and wherefore I pray	1.0262700319290161
I can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination	24.26842498779297
Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	117.29473876953125
He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy	77.08908081054688
Old Dants however sprang forward	175.17689514160156
There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand	74.12213134765625
He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said My worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions	219.77984619140625
Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight	102.72820281982422
What is the meaning of all this inquired Caderousse frowningly of Danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	181.3022918701172
0073 m	94273.8828125
How can I tell you replied he I am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about	78.08515930175781
Caderousse then looked around for Fernand but he had disappeared	139.42791748046875
The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness	35.81087112426758
The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory	4638.7294921875
So so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to Danglars this then I suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday All I can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it	275.3354187011719
Nonsense returned Danglars I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces	37.678375244140625
No you did not answered Caderousse you merely threw it byI saw it lying in a corner	24.042749404907227
Hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk	36.48809814453125
Where is Fernand inquired Caderousse	39.90666198730469
How do I know replied Danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely	42.338600158691406
Never mind where he is let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends	30.598453521728516
During this conversation Dants after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying Make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that	130.7178497314453
0075 m	140.38482666015625
Oh to be sure responded Danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake I feel quite certain	339.4858093261719
Dants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers	56.81536865234375
A carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles	1.0992087125778198
Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried Mercds stretching out her arms to him from the balcony	15.991374015808105
The prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out Goodbye Mercdswe shall soon meet again Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas	45.15345001220703
Wait for me here all of you cried M	100.37655639648438
Morrel I will take the first conveyance I find and hurry to Marseilles whence I will bring you word how all is going on	118.74954986572266
That s right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can	77.54173278808594
This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	56.012542724609375
The old father and Mercds remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others arms	176.443359375
Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor Mercds had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dants	140.05667114257812
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair	68.59705352783203
He is the cause of all this miseryI am quite sure of it whispered Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off Fernand to Danglars	100.62714385986328
I do nt think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme	130.28541564941406
I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it	334.9788513183594
You do nt mention those who aided and abetted the deed said Caderousse	103.58952331542969
Surely answered Danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air	33.412479400634766
You can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head	53.76251220703125
Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	279.0887145996094
What think you Danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event	353.20050048828125
Why replied he I think it just possible Dants may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband	430.79888916015625
But how could he have done so without your knowledge Danglars since you are the ships supercargo	14.025020599365234
Why as for that I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden	320.3233642578125
I know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastrets warehouse and at Smyrna from Pascals that is all I was obliged to know and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars	91.22692108154297
Now I recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me	63.60464859008789
There you see exclaimed Danglars	38.66298294067383
Now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dants hidden treasures	165.0688018798828
Mercds however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers arrest	96.26871490478516
Her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing	139.04615783691406
Come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope	230.90878295898438
Hope repeated Danglars	218.59190368652344
Hope faintly murmured Fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance	107.58890533447266
Good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout	147.71652221679688
Here comes M	74.10237884521484
Morrel back	61.10986328125
No doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released	130.2661590576172
Mercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door	23.850709915161133
He was very pale	75.64917755126953
What news exclaimed a general burst of voices	228.51100158691406
Alas my friends replied M	140.0738983154297
Morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected	78.62654876708984
Oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth Mercds	215.48976135253906
That I believe answered M	64.7562026977539
Morrel but still he is charged	39.24856948852539
With what inquired the elder Dants	75.513916015625
With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated	15.301797866821289
A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercds the old man sank into a chair	116.02676391601562
Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but I can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	206.32350158691406
I am determined to tell them all about it	35.923866271972656
Be silent you simpleton cried Danglars grasping him by the arm or I will not answer even for your own safety	24.963293075561523
Who can tell whether Dants be innocent or guilty The vessel did touch at Elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island	506.52099609375
Now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices	355.6791687011719
With the rapid instinct of selfishness Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on Danglars and then caution supplanted generosity	126.12255096435547
Suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion	50.69289779663086
To be sure answered Danglars	262.17486572265625
Let us wait by all means	36.900474548339844
If he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy	92.27014923095703
Let us go then	26.596277236938477
I can not stay here any longer	84.16967010498047
With all my heart replied Danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	99.02229309082031
Let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course	95.13594818115234
After their departure Fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercds led the girl to her home while some friends of Dants conducted his father nearly lifeless to the Alles de Meilhan	45.28722381591797
The rumor of Edmonds arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city	206.14572143554688
Could you ever have credited such a thing my dear Danglars asked M	248.8594207763672
Morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dants from M	78.37672424316406
de Villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse	156.1553497314453
Could you have believed such a thing possible	85.04788208007812
Why you know I told you replied Danglars that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance	31.453813552856445
And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself	89.03408813476562
0079 m	60.64442443847656
Certainly not returned Danglars	70.79305267333984
Then added in a low whisper You understand that on account of your uncle M	79.85487365722656
Policar Morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon	76.74932861328125
I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	47.68015670776367
I am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else	232.2986602783203
Tis well Danglarstis well replied M	12.415088653564453
You are a worthy fellow and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon	97.4291000366211
Is it possible you were so kind	97.25953674316406
Yes indeed I had previously inquired of Dants what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you	1181.0601806640625
And what was his reply	16.18288803100586
That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also	92.43952178955078
The hypocrite murmured Danglars	1.0233898162841797
Poor Dants said Caderousse	174.9026336669922
No one can deny his being a noblehearted young fellow	47.92942810058594
But meanwhile continued M	47.92287063598633
Morrel here is the Pharaon without a captain	79.95294952392578
Oh replied Danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dants will be set at liberty	156.0237579345703
No doubt but in the meantime	74.36583709716797
I am entirely at your service M	26.499404907226562
Morrel answered Danglars	54.68321990966797
You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon Edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dants and myself each to resume our respective posts	54.84611511230469
Thanks Danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	172.3478240966797
I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight	63.726417541503906
Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business	63.58860778808594
Be easy on that score M	29.496479034423828
Morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond	18.313426971435547
I will let you know that directly I have seen M	68.0296401977539
de Villefort whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmonds favor	55.964378356933594
I am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and I fancy not a bad sort of one	85.6518783569336
Perhaps not replied Danglars but I hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him	157.1571502685547
Well well returned M	398.8253173828125
Morrel we shall see	313.48297119140625
But now hasten on board I will join you there ere long	28.280534744262695
So saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de Justice	100.43888854980469
0081 m	69.4753189086914
You see said Danglars addressing Caderousse the turn things have taken	87.84354400634766
Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence	57.833274841308594
Not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences	52.42124557495117
But who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but Fernand you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed I fancied I had destroyed it	38.663719177246094
Oh no replied Caderousse that I can answer for you did not	1.0201209783554077
I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor	49.990299224853516
Well then if you did depend upon it Fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it	338.52252197265625
And now I think of it by Heavens he may have sent the letter itself Fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised	120.0621109008789
Then you were aware of Dants being engaged in a conspiracy	140.7397918701172
Not I	110.18038940429688
As I before said I thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more	66.93002319335938
It seems however that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth	125.4417495727539
Still argued Caderousse I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that I had had no hand in it	45.850990295410156
You will see Danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us	57.784481048583984
Nonsense If any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is Fernand	68.97769927978516
How can we be implicated in any way All we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us	413.37017822265625
Amen responded Caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to Danglars and bending his steps towards the Alles de Meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea	63.48160171508789
So far then said Danglars mentally all has gone as I would have it	381.94921875
I am temporarily commander of the Pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	86.26498413085938
My only fear is the chance of Dants being released	45.47509002685547
But there he is in the hands of Justice and added he with a smile she will take her own	3.6204442977905273
So saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the Pharaon where M	29.530338287353516
Morrel had agreed to meet him	100.3295669555664
Chapter 6	1698.34326171875
The Deputy Procureur du Roi	1187.3052978515625
In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite the Medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by Dants	84.5943603515625
In this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar	10.409457206726074
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles societymagistrates who had resigned their office during the usurpers reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Cond and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god	51.349605560302734
The guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	96.80863952636719
The emperor now king of the petty Island of Elba after having held sovereign sway over onehalf of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand soulsafter having been accustomed to hear the Vive Napolons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languageswas looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne	51.53034210205078
The magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine	372.4579162597656
It was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	432.3903503417969
An old man decorated with the cross of Saint Louis now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII	93.4366683959961
It was the Marquis de SaintMran	109.51752471923828
This toast recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peaceloving King of France excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air   lAnglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures	200.79063415527344
In a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed	1.0147989988327026
Ah said the Marquise de SaintMran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty yearsah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the Reign of Terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our Louis the wellbeloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their Napoleon the accursed	157.26246643066406
Am I not right Villefort	75.01058959960938
I beg your pardon madame	65.29167175292969
I really must pray you to excuse me butin truthI was not attending to the conversation	78.51602172851562
Marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on ones wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics	391.7229309082031
Never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon M	68.92315673828125
de Villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said	161.4894256591797
But therenow take himhe is your own for as long as you like	101.37633514404297
Villefort I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you	106.71907806396484
If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught I shall be delighted to answer said M	33.01076889038086
de Villefort	96.09471130371094
Never mind Rene replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a womans nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love	93.12189483642578
I forgive you	117.65105438232422
What I was saying Villefort was that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion	56.443077087402344
They had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism	108.86434936523438
Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality	41.100669860839844
He cried the marquise Napoleon the type of equality For mercys sake then what would you call Robespierre Come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough	51.32172393798828
0085 m	82.89149475097656
Nay madame I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestalthat of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendme	117.85487365722656
The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne	263.9904479980469
Observe said Villefort smiling I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April in the year 1814 were lucky days for France worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as I trust he is forever Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites	309.1168518066406
Still marquise it has been so with other usurpersCromwell for instance who was not half so bad as Napoleon had his partisans and advocates	91.17816925048828
Do you know Villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain But I excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven	52.11665344238281
A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort	33.17131042480469
Tis true madame answered he that my father was a Girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the kings death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror and had wellnigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished	491.321533203125
True replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which I may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin the Count Noirtier became a senator	91.06546020507812
Dear mother interposed Rene you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside	51.29277420043945
Suffer me also madame replied Villefort to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de SaintMrans that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past	34.90391540527344
What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall For my own part I have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles	205.908447265625
He wasnay probably may still bea Bonapartist and is called Noirtier I on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de Villefort	110.3537368774414
Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung	54.72221374511719
Bravo Villefort cried the marquis excellently well said Come now I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past	124.26190948486328
With all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten	174.2124481201172
I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you	33.63681411743164
All I ask is that Villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	39.2671012878418
Remember also Villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as I do and here she extended to him her handas I now do at your entreaty	85.90592956542969
But bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family	785.5261840820312
Alas madame returned Villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe	62.5590705871582
I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment	1.066483736038208
But we have not done with the thing yet	516.7630004882812
0087 m	34.67292404174805
Do you indeed think so inquired the marquise	64.39774322509766
I am at least fearful of it	73.58442687988281
Napoleon in the Island of Elba is too near France and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	62.23716354370117
Marseilles is filled with halfpay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower	2110.735595703125
You have heard perhaps said the Comte de Salvieux one of M	49.47028732299805
de SaintMrans oldest friends and chamberlain to the Comte dArtois that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence	254.38815307617188
Yes they were talking about it when we left Paris said M	86.65081024169922
de SaintMran and where is it decided to transfer him	180.16429138183594
To Saint Helena	103.40174102783203
For heavens sake where is that asked the marquise	120.70853424072266
An island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count	192.41683959960938
So much the better	53.164306640625
As Villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica where he was born and Naples of which his brotherinlaw is king and face to face with Italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son	57.71596908569336
Unfortunately said Villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts	68.1802978515625
Oh well we shall find some way out of it responded M	104.18013763427734
de Salvieux	80.00240325927734
There was nt any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc dEnghien	100.69304656982422
Well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the Holy Alliance we shall be rid of Napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of M	180.29232788085938
de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans	328.5174560546875
The king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracytis the best and surest means of preventing mischief	65.1507568359375
Unfortunately madame answered Villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place	78.31493377685547
Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it	78.81768798828125
Nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done	60.92830276489258
Oh M	45.9854621887207
de Villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the Comte de Salvieux and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de SaintMran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles	39.75825500488281
I never was in a lawcourt I am told it is so very amusing	253.71218872070312
Amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a lawcourt a case of real and genuine distressa drama of life	210.6241455078125
The prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead ofas is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedygoing home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrowis removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner	39.010013580322266
I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	18.63697052001953
Of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present	60.13728713989258
For shame M	64.7562026977539
de Villefort said Rene becoming quite pale do nt you see how you are frightening usand yet you laugh	34.59330749511719
What would you have Tis like a duel	44.63115310668945
I have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart	24.08152961730957
Gracious heavens M	321.4222412109375
de Villefort said Rene becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest	59.06024169921875
Indeed I am replied the young magistrate with a smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated	104.43853759765625
Suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under Napoleonwell can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellowcreatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey Besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power	112.34300231933594
I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words	8.934331893920898
No my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence	215.89703369140625
Rene uttered a smothered exclamation	104.06893157958984
Bravo cried one of the guests that is what I call talking to some purpose	382.99114990234375
Just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	97.1087875366211
What a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear Villefort remarked a third I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father	477.5895690917969
Upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him	71.6566390991211
Oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed Rene it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues	200.08328247070312
Why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for do nt you see Rene the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirtytwo millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale	65.24498748779297
I do nt know anything about that replied Rene but M	169.89059448242188
de Villefort you have promised mehave you notalways to show mercy to those I plead for	65.38697814941406
Make yourself quite easy on that point answered Villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and I will always consult upon our verdicts	83.14639282226562
My love said the marquise attend to your doves your lapdogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand	42.8057975769043
Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	66.20735168457031
There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point	326.1874694824219
Cedant arma tog said Villefort with a bow	124.9427490234375
I can not speak Latin responded the marquise	97.8334732055664
Well said Rene I can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your owna physician for instance	234.025390625
Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel	26.178327560424805
Dear good Rene whispered Villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker	51.88257598876953
Let us hope my child cried the marquis that M	194.05743408203125
de Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work	281.9131774902344
And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fathers conduct added the incorrigible marquise	96.76783752441406
Madame replied Villefort with a mournful smile I have already had the honor to observe that my father hasat least I hope soabjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and ordera better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while I have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction	73.37804412841797
Having made this wellturned speech Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court	93.48033905029297
Do you know my dear Villefort cried the Comte de Salvieux that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de Cond and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles	65.78646850585938
Then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying Villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word Noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of VillefortVillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession I like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the Marquis and Marquise de SaintMran	160.8575439453125
I should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it	78.22386932373047
Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured Villefort	147.65130615234375
I give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter	28.1362361907959
0091 m	74.83374786376953
That is true answered the marquis	185.9502410888672
How much do I owe this gracious prince What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude	72.1681900024414
That is right cried the marquise	219.290771484375
I love to see you thus	80.15231323242188
Now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome	143.03733825683594
For my part dear mother interposed Rene I trust your wishes will not prosper and that Providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into M	104.83349609375
de Villeforts handsthen I shall be contented	207.39511108398438
Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis	1616.5948486328125
If you wish to see me the kings attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician	842.7935180664062
At this moment and as though the utterance of Villeforts wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear	32.3975830078125
Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	65.16558074951172
Rene regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	49.682193756103516
You were wishing just now said Villefort addressing her that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer	169.5700225830078
Well I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal	119.00775909423828
And wherefore were you called away just now asked Mademoiselle de SaintMran with an air of deep interest	1.0179624557495117
For a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner	62.633094787597656
How dreadful exclaimed Rene turning pale	50.652740478515625
Is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words	232.90066528320312
Why if my information prove correct a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered	96.63255310058594
Can I believe my ears cried the marquise	101.18986511230469
I will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said Villefort	68.2857437133789
The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named Edmond Dants mate of the ship Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris	116.85662078857422
Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dants who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	86.68114471435547
Should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dants on board the Pharaon	116.39893341064453
But said Rene this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kings attorney	163.7835235595703
0093 m	99.33015441894531
True but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party	202.6354522705078
Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise	35.72723388671875
Nay dear mother say the accused person	10.10408878326416
You know we can not yet pronounce him guilty	1012.4987182617188
He is in safe custody answered Villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman	120.69760131835938
And where is the unfortunate being asked Rene	8.293911933898926
He is at my house	24.425546646118164
Come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us	26.284317016601562
You are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you	49.8321533203125
Oh Villefort cried Rene clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal	51.79752731323242
The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly	181.41123962402344
To give you pleasure my sweet Rene I promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off	402.74932861328125
Rene shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head	411.49951171875
Never mind that foolish girl Villefort said the marquise	208.54286193847656
She will soon get over these things	44.51271438598633
So saying Madame de SaintMran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort who while imprinting a soninlaws respectful salute on it looked at Rene as much as to say I must try and fancy tis your dear hand I kiss as it should have been	165.6654815673828
These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor Rene	28.330625534057617
Upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds	91.5438461303711
I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state	99.169677734375
Oh mother murmured Rene	26.284317016601562
Nay madame I pray you pardon this little traitor	19.80345344543457
I promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty I will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say Fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return Villefort departed with paradise in his heart	31.96672248840332
Chapter 7	298.3587341308594
The Examination	322.9060363769531
No sooner had Villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands	280.1994934082031
Now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	96.1220703125
Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career Grard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be	56.23809814453125
Already rich he held a high official situation though only twentyseven	31.61093521118164
He was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king and besides her personal attractions which were very great Mademoiselle de SaintMrans family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor	107.84351348876953
The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	65.2997055053711
These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	67.2957992553711
At the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	329.4698486328125
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth he composed his face as we have before described and said I have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy	41.12487030029297
We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy monsieur all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk	27.19056510925293
The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dants mate on board the threemaster the Pharaon trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna and belonging to Morrel   Son of Marseilles	126.04794311523438
Before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines	29.463613510131836
Oh no monsieur he is very young	218.16839599609375
How old	1.0984926223754883
Nineteen or twenty at the most	79.85285186767578
At this moment and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was M	281.6949462890625
Ah M	88.90673065185547
de Villefort cried he I am delighted to see you	3.828681468963623
Some of your people have committed the strangest mistakethey have just arrested Edmond Dants mate of my vessel	98.22724914550781
I know it monsieur replied Villefort and I am now going to examine him	148.2970733642578
Oh said Morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and I do	6.462138652801514
He is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and I will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service	53.18678283691406
Oh M	1.0103023052215576
de Villefort I beseech your indulgence for him	116.68045806884766
Villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles Morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of Bonapartism	61.64177322387695
Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied coldly	85.24423217773438
You are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal	136.3646240234375
Is it not true	146.22186279296875
The magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence	120.47232055664062
Morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what Dants had told him of his interview with the grandmarshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him	56.956363677978516
He replied however in a tone of deep interest	39.762603759765625
I entreat you M	63.47602844238281
de Villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon	114.70799255371094
This give us sounded revolutionary in the deputys ears	114.8559341430664
Ah ah murmured he is Dants then a member of some Carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form He was if I recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others	106.920166015625
Then he added Monsieur you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and I must do my duty	730.3421020507812
0097 m	47.23466873168945
As he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the Palais de Justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where Villefort had left him	92.35210418701172
The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner	238.66456604003906
Villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at Dants and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying Bring in the prisoner	798.2822265625
Rapid as had been Villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	68.60261535644531
He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	58.46891784667969
Villeforts first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words	60.37839126586914
He stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk	92.72434997558594
An instant after Dants entered	996.89453125
He was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in M	245.12637329101562
Morrels salon	296.9527587890625
It was then that he encountered for the first time Villeforts lookthat look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own	114.0936508178711
Who and what are you demanded Villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hours time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim	383.3688049316406
My name is Edmond Dants replied the young man calmly I am mate of the Pharaon belonging to Messrs	82.79988098144531
Morrel   Son	78.04283142089844
Your age continued Villefort	55.216400146484375
Nineteen returned Dants	21.650089263916016
What were you doing at the moment you were arrested	33.10923767089844
I was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M	43.94678497314453
de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercds	25.96177864074707
You were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	25.092607498168945
Yes monsieur I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years	135.35096740722656
Villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of Dants surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	72.35404205322266
This philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at M	70.775634765625
de SaintMrans and he arranged mentally while Dants awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence	143.4780731201172
When this speech was arranged Villefort turned to Dants	1107.92578125
0099 m	40.952537536621094
Go on sir said he	604.2227783203125
What would you have me say	1.0093531608581543
Give all the information in your power	138.0807647705078
Tell me on which point you desire information and I will tell all I know only added he with a smile I warn you I know very little	67.83871459960938
Have you served under the usurper	55.911434173583984
I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell	115.45126342773438
It is reported your political opinions are extreme said Villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation	90.14002227783203
My political opinions replied Dants	45.02744674682617
Alas sir I never had any opinions	27.7663631439209
I am hardly nineteen I know nothing I have no part to play	17.163358688354492
If I obtain the situation I desire I shall owe it to M	17.163358688354492
Thus all my opinionsI will not say public but privateare confined to these three sentimentsI love my father I respect M	52.960060119628906
Morrel and I adore Mercds	20.164928436279297
This sir is all I can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is	77.03164672851562
As Dants spoke Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of Rene who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him	134.15609741210938
With the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence	99.52777099609375
This lad for he was scarcely a mansimple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodextended his affection even to his judge spite of Villeforts severe look and stern accent	174.1865997314453
Dants seemed full of kindness	72.10263061523438
Pardieu said Villefort he is a noble fellow	118.7976303100586
I hope I shall gain Renes favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me	64.2716064453125
I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private	20.60209083557129
Full of this idea Villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to Dants the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	65.66333770751953
Sir said Villefort have you any enemies at least that you know	62.51848220825195
I have enemies replied Dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	72.93303680419922
As for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but I have striven to repress it	129.57022094726562
I have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for I am too young but as an elder brother	183.412841796875
But you may have excited jealousy	20.986257553100586
You are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone	69.76366424560547
You are right you know men better than I do and what you say may possibly be the case I confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it because then I should be forced to hate them	54.251190185546875
You are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you	123.45709228515625
You seem a worthy young man I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	52.925559997558594
Here is the paper do you know the writing As he spoke Villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Dants	92.87285614013672
Dants read it	100.5052490234375
A cloud passed over his brow as he said	74.13994598388672
No monsieur I do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	252.2578582763672
Whoever did it writes well	77.0230941772461
I am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at Villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy	106.443359375
And by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness	71.81439971923828
Now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dants had just given back to him	1.0058252811431885
None at all	19.94985580444336
I will tell you the real facts	143.2069854736328
I swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for Mercds by the life of my father	728.1041259765625
Speak monsieur said Villefort	81.49535369873047
Then internally If Rene could see me I hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator	122.6696548461914
Well when we quitted Naples Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever	47.32316207885742
As we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him	261.8658752441406
My dear Dants said he swear to perform what I am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance	37.63756561279297
I swear captain replied I	69.92869567871094
Well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the Island of Elba disembark at PortoFerrajo ask for the grandmarshal give him this letterperhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission	36.88690185546875
You will accomplish what I was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it	66.73950958251953
I will do it captain but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect	109.2647933959961
Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain	1.0454856157302856
At these words he gave me a ring	219.51747131347656
It was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died	73.47618103027344
And what did you do then	98.3836669921875
What I ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	195.63046264648438
Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands	41.52505111694336
I sailed for the Island of Elba where I arrived the next day I ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone	218.6420440673828
As I had expected I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grandmarshal but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted	1.0027613639831543
He questioned me concerning Captain Lecleres death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris	22.7329044342041
I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	82.1384506225586
I landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom I found more lovely than ever	176.9624786376953
Thanks to M	327.52581787109375
Morrel all the forms were got over in a word I was as I told you at my marriage feast and I should have been married in an hour and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust	125.53473663330078
Ah said Villefort this seems to me the truth	84.78646850585938
If you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain	193.6586456298828
Give up this letter you have brought from Elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends	267.4418029785156
I am free then sir cried Dants joyfully	30.72444725036621
Yes but first give me this letter	273.8746032714844
You have it already for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet	88.09980010986328
Stop a moment said the deputy as Dants took his hat and gloves	195.61264038085938
To whom is it addressed	127.00196075439453
To Monsieur Noirtier Rue CoqHron Paris	66.1838607788086
Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room Villefort could not have been more stupefied	83.59497833251953
He sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	238.07418823242188
Noirtier Rue CoqHron No	59.97797393798828
13 murmured he growing still paler	222.85426330566406
Yes said Dants do you know him	161.65269470214844
No replied Villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators	52.97554016113281
0103 m	66.1944351196289
It is a conspiracy then asked Dants who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm	922.8462524414062
I have however already told you sir I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter	47.08414840698242
Yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said Villefort	42.42173385620117
I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it	57.71858215332031
Have you shown this letter to anyone asked Villefort becoming still more pale	142.95652770996094
To no one on my honor	134.02687072753906
Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba and addressed to M	22.577407836914062
Everybody except the person who gave it to me	86.32949829101562
And that was too much far too much murmured Villefort	208.43023681640625
Villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dants with apprehension	86.67908477783203
After reading the letter Villefort covered his face with his hands	66.36250305175781
Oh said Dants timidly what is the matter Villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter	40.213035583496094
And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter	109.21155548095703
I give you my word of honor sir said Dants but what is the matter You are illshall I ring for assistanceshall I call	117.9607925415039
No said Villefort rising hastily stay where you are	307.8979187011719
It is for me to give orders here and not you	182.7144317626953
Monsieur replied Dants proudly it was only to summon assistance for you	159.2460174560547
I want none it was a temporary indisposition	175.88372802734375
Attend to yourself answer me	50.106834411621094
Dants waited expecting a question but in vain	18.381269454956055
Villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter	105.64549255371094
Oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort I am lost And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	75.65137481689453
Oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly	348.26409912109375
In heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me I will answer you	52.166751861572266
Villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm	46.34516525268555
Sir said he I am no longer able as I had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty before doing so I must consult the trial justice what my own feeling is you already know	100.76543426513672
Oh monsieur cried Dants you have been rather a friend than a judge	76.96809387207031
0105 m	30.64728355407715
Well I must detain you some time longer but I will strive to make it as short as possible	221.2819061279297
The principal charge against you is this letter and you see Villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed	15693.548828125
You see I destroy it	47.274478912353516
Oh exclaimed Dants you are goodness itself	133.49156188964844
Listen continued Villefort you can now have confidence in me after what I have done	156.972900390625
Oh command and I will obey	414.2611083984375
Listen this is not a command but advice I give you	43.963951110839844
Speak and I will follow your advice	92.8308334350586
I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice	163.71372985839844
Should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter	409.5246276855469
I promise	208.04794311523438
It was Villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	83.02729797363281
You see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and I alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly and you are saved	230.92849731445312
Be satisfied I will deny it	86.05278778076172
It was the only letter you had	74.86083984375
It was	180.98605346679688
Swear it	77.74439239501953
I swear it	90.33545684814453
Villefort rang	42.384552001953125
A police agent entered	203.15054321289062
Villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head	1034.4312744140625
Follow him said Villefort to Dants	478.8519592285156
Dants saluted Villefort and retired	152.70721435546875
Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself halffainting into a chair	41.622108459472656
Alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at Marseilles I should have been ruined	90.74053192138672
This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	132.29925537109375
Oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes Suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought	445.9228210449219
This will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me I will make my fortune	336.5022888183594
Now to the work I have in hand	198.41351318359375
And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed	191.74264526367188
0107 m	653.4502563476562
Chapter 8	157.8443145751953
The Chteau dIf	160.25839233398438
The commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on Dants right and the other on his left	37.60554504394531
A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder	191.47731018066406
The Palais de Justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the Accoules	101.12865447998047
After numberless windings Dants saw a door with an iron wicket	53.47346496582031
The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to Dants as if struck on his heart	2294.234130859375
The door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him	38.04640579223633
The air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	210.17970275878906
He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of Villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom	785.6965942382812
It was four oclock when Dants was placed in this chamber	154.29420471191406
It was as we have said the 1st of March and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	30.485767364501953
The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and Dants sank again into his seat	57.77332305908203
At last about ten oclock and just as Dants began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment	108.0082015991211
By the torchlight Dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes	91.92848205566406
He had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	97.78104400634766
Are you come to fetch me asked he	406.5622863769531
Yes replied a gendarme	208.83822631835938
By the orders of the deputy procureur	133.39324951171875
I believe so	132.72596740722656
The conviction that they came from M	119.98381805419922
de Villefort relieved all Dants apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	114.33905792236328
A carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him	83.93256378173828
Is this carriage for me said Dants	37.0335693359375
It is for you replied a gendarme	54.52162551879883
Dants was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones	138.87850952148438
The prisoner glanced at the windowsthey were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither	40.46491241455078
Through the grating however Dants saw they were passing through the Rue Caisserie and by the Rue SaintLaurent and the Rue Taramis to the quay	50.58430099487305
Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne	463.83740234375
The carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order Dants saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	83.75560760498047
Can all this force be summoned on my account thought he	1.0078248977661133
The officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered Dants question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port	149.49917602539062
The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example	61.920166015625
They advanced towards a boat which a customhouse officer held by a chain near the quay	28.264554977416992
The soldiers looked at Dants with an air of stupid curiosity	155.5023651123047
In an instant he was placed in the sternsheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon	162.35195922851562
At a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as Dants knew in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor	149.8565216064453
The prisoners first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure airfor air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before La Rserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball	57.402774810791016
Dants folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently	45.02431869506836
0111 m	63.98630142211914
The boat continued her voyage	137.40786743164062
They had passed the Tte de Mort were now off the Anse du Pharo and about to double the battery	21.92267608642578
This manuvre was incomprehensible to Dants	4806.89697265625
Whither are you taking me asked he	41.073219299316406
You will soon know	463.6087646484375
But still	47.99142837524414
We are forbidden to give you any explanation	63.26445007324219
Dants trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent	1.0454856157302856
The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind	137.40786743164062
The boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point	35.091556549072266
He was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury	680.4281005859375
Besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier he had nothing to apprehend Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him	104.15828704833984
He waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	60.827510833740234
They had left the Ile Ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the Point des Catalans	197.85147094726562
It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there Mercds dwelt	43.69670486450195
How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercds that her lover was within three hundred yards of her	51.503204345703125
One light alone was visible and Dants saw that it came from Mercds chamber	153.5801544189453
Mercds was the only one awake in the whole settlement	7318.22314453125
A loud cry could be heard by her	47.17190170288086
But pride restrained him and he did not utter it	274.0389709472656
What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman	144.42724609375
He remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of Mercds	646.3132934570312
An intervening elevation of land hid the light	814.9342041015625
Dants turned and perceived that they had got out to sea	295.1545104980469
While he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the boat was now moving with the wind	71.05606079101562
In spite of his repugnance to address the guards Dants turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand	72.14155578613281
Comrade said he I adjure you as a Christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going	89.25074768066406
I am Captain Dants a loyal Frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and I promise you on my honor I will submit to my fate	1.7159162759780884
The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said I see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied	71.70732879638672
You are a native of Marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going	38.228782653808594
On my honor I have no idea	35.6080322265625
Have you no idea whatever	134.18666076660156
None at all	77.11617279052734
That is impossible	407.10723876953125
I swear to you it is true	39.31239318847656
Tell me I entreat	99.11463928222656
But my orders	452.20849609375
Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour	25.232099533081055
You see I can not escape even if I intended	77.90351867675781
Unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know	18.00510025024414
I do not	55.96342468261719
Look round you then	58.73202896118164
Dants rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the Chteau dIf	1.0130890607833862
This gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to Dants like a scaffold to a malefactor	167.37684631347656
The Chteau dIf cried he what are we going there for	54.58692932128906
The gendarme smiled	28.88138771057129
I am not going there to be imprisoned said Dants it is only used for political prisoners	218.23094177246094
I have committed no crime	45.125328063964844
Are there any magistrates or judges at the Chteau dIf	144.6942138671875
There are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls	37.77311325073242
Come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature	286.2520446777344
Dants pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	43.63726043701172
You think then said he that I am taken to the Chteau dIf to be imprisoned there	50.57683563232422
It is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard	108.79518127441406
Without any inquiry without any formality	63.5070686340332
All the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made	61.85630416870117
And so in spite of M	41.66316223144531
de Villeforts promises	245.99330139160156
I do not know what M	90.91893768310547
de Villefort promised you said the gendarme but I know we are taking you to the Chteau dIf	32.42960739135742
But what are you doing Help comrades help	557.9935913085938
By a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived Dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat	180.381591796875
He fell back cursing with rage	129.92466735839844
Good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor Believe softspoken gentlemen again Hark ye my friend I have disobeyed my first order but I will not disobey the second and if you move I will blow your brains out	34.7175407409668
And he levelled his carbine at Dants who felt the muzzle against his temple	93.28749084472656
For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	161.58380126953125
But he bethought him of M	43.28961181640625
de Villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible	1.0454856157302856
He remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury	43.30885314941406
At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock	199.72744750976562
One of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and Dants guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat	106.68009948730469
His guards taking him by the arms and coatcollar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind	161.5674591064453
Dants made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist	62.74204635620117
He did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair	220.9410400390625
They halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	158.88560485839844
He looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	60.753536224365234
They waited upwards of ten minutes	53.73435974121094
Certain Dants could not escape the gendarmes released him	89.17732238769531
They seemed awaiting orders	97.68234252929688
The orders came	1347.6378173828125
Where is the prisoner said a voice	357.0440368652344
Here replied the gendarmes	38.10226821899414
Let him follow me I will take him to his cell	141.44898986816406
Go said the gendarmes thrusting Dants forward	64.8951187133789
The prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed Dants the features of his conductor an underjailer illclothed and of sullen appearance	338.5572509765625
0113 m	182.8465576171875
Here is your chamber for tonight said he	37.76651382446289
It is late and the governor is asleep	95.96256256103516
Tomorrow perhaps he may change you	83.83248138427734
In the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for	107.36648559570312
And before Dants could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	118.45914459228516
Dants was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead	266.2645568847656
With the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave Dants where he was	20.775161743164062
He found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	96.98944091796875
He had passed the night standing and without sleep	110.99996185302734
The jailer advanced Dants appeared not to perceive him	38.46178436279297
He touched him on the shoulder	131.38430786132812
Edmond started	75.18798828125
Have you not slept said the jailer	112.82018280029297
I do not know replied Dants	63.05023956298828
The jailer stared	51.836219787597656
Are you hungry continued he	71.25682830810547
I do not know	121.80699920654297
Do you wish for anything	69.97853088378906
I wish to see the governor	98.177001953125
The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber	37.292110443115234
Dants followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed	78.38056945800781
All his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished	80.16336059570312
The day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage	19.12796974182129
One thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel escaped to Spain or Italy where Mercds and his father could have joined him	748.9672241210938
He had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	668.2491455078125
He spoke Italian like a Tuscan and Spanish like a Castilian he would have been free and happy with Mercds and his father whereas he was now confined in the Chteau dIf that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercds and all this because he had trusted to Villeforts promise	19.83856964111328
The thought was maddening and Dants threw himself furiously down on his straw	62.869834899902344
The next morning at the same hour the jailer came again	97.1854476928711
Well said the jailer are you more reasonable today Dants made no reply	108.93938446044922
Come cheer up is there anything that I can do for you	40.97282028198242
I wish to see the governor	30.120723724365234
I have already told you it was impossible	85.60782623291016
Why so	985.4668579101562
Because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it	252.9032745361328
What is allowed then	64.49322509765625
Better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about	38.43568801879883
I do not want books I am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but I wish to see the governor	85.3881607055664
If you worry me by repeating the same thing I will not bring you any more to eat	71.57926177978516
Well then said Edmond if you do not I shall die of hungerthat is all	130.75587463378906
The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone	66.51983642578125
What you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair	237.69509887695312
But asked Dants how long shall I have to wait	1.7159162759780884
Ah a monthsix monthsa year	82.83270263671875
It is too long a time	1.0715173482894897
I wish to see him at once	132.2305145263672
Ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight	121.82087707519531
You think so	282.1333312988281
Yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abb became mad who was in this chamber before you	67.73915100097656
0119 m	271.64862060546875
How long has he left it	116.74556732177734
Two years	501.4897766113281
Was he liberated then	52.44667053222656
No he was put in a dungeon	398.4814147949219
Listen said Dants	316.4662170410156
I am not an abb I am not mad perhaps I shall be but at present unfortunately I am not	158.1016387939453
I will make you another offer	77.7002182006836
What is that	108.7240219116211
I do not offer you a million because I have it not but I will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to Marseilles you will seek out a young girl named Mercds at the Catalans and give her two lines from me	188.82684326171875
0120 m	63.06764602661133
If I took them and were detected I should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that I should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred	62.93462371826172
Well said Dants mark this if you refuse at least to tell Mercds I am here I will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool	192.60025024414062
Threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad	97.44145965576172
The abb began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here	234.5174560546875
Dants whirled the stool round his head	241.59095764160156
All right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so	143.21266174316406
I will send word to the governor	38.93783187866211
Very well returned Dants dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad	44.900840759277344
The jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers	114.03713989257812
By the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath	623.8424682617188
To the dungeon then said the corporal	38.29650115966797
Yes we must put the madman with the madmen	205.37071228027344
The soldiers seized Dants who followed passively	78.46197509765625
He descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in	41.40003204345703
The door closed and Dants advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness	311.033935546875
The jailer was right Dants wanted but little of being utterly mad	52.219749450683594
Chapter 9	60.32368469238281
The Evening of the Betrothal	35.857505798339844
Villefort had as we have said hastened back to Madame de SaintMrans in the Place du Grand Cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon	42.75101852416992
Rene was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation	88.97093963623047
Well Decapitator Guardian of the State Royalist Brutus what is the matter said one	36.594322204589844
Speak out	144.53741455078125
Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror asked another	138.9906768798828
Has the Corsican ogre broken loose cried a third	118.69735717773438
Marquise said Villefort approaching his future motherinlaw I request your pardon for thus leaving you	198.77989196777344
Will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation	84.77389526367188
Ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on Villeforts brow	189.88914489746094
So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to Rene judge for yourself if it be not important	46.332969665527344
You are going to leave us cried Rene unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement	57.33892822265625
Alas returned Villefort I must	64.0107421875
Where then are you going asked the marquise	86.08113861083984
That madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for Paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them	56.06157302856445
The guests looked at each other	163.5425262451172
You wish to speak to me alone said the marquis	81.1473388671875
Yes let us go to the library please	83.8686294555664
The marquis took his arm and they left the salon	81.88274383544922
Well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is	46.58684158325195
An affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in Paris	37.004451751708984
Now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property	204.8309783935547
All my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs	34.68235397338867
Then sell outsell out marquis or you will lose it all	116.06212615966797
0123 m	69.55719757080078
But how can I sell out here	26.30580711364746
You have a broker have you not	151.35801696777344
Then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now I shall arrive too late	43.50925064086914
The deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then	237.54722595214844
And sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price	66.6885757446289
Now then said Villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook I must have another	51.09172439575195
To whom	321.4573669433594
To the king	91.71039581298828
To the king	74.40279388427734
I dare not write to his majesty	59.07297134399414
I do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask M	126.35424041748047
de Salvieux to do so	77.0980453491211
I want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time	1.0229977369308472
But address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the Tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night	23.77881622314453
Doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	11.661396026611328
The keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself	22.95962905883789
I tell you marquis my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service I do him	26.125242233276367
In that case go and get ready	369.2978515625
I will call Salvieux and make him write the letter	151.48495483398438
Be as quick as possible I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour	116.95167541503906
Tell your coachman to stop at the door	203.17803955078125
You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Rene whom I leave on such a day with great regret	48.20449447631836
You will find them both here and can make your farewells in person	73.09374237060547
A thousand thanksand now for the letter	52.20969009399414
The marquis rang a servant entered	134.2978057861328
Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him	81.90855407714844
Now then go said the marquis	11.348864555358887
I shall be gone only a few moments	67.79975128173828
Villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace	99.12239837646484
At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	1.0454856157302856
It was Mercds who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him	62.503761291503906
As Villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	148.29742431640625
Dants had spoken of Mercds and Villefort instantly recognized her	104.9677505493164
Her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused	35.45301818847656
The young man you speak of said Villefort abruptly is a great criminal and I can do nothing for him mademoiselle	112.0931625366211
Mercds burst into tears and as Villefort strove to pass her again addressed him	246.45156860351562
But at least tell me where he is that I may know whether he is alive or dead said she	110881.3203125
0125 m	48.168365478515625
I do not know he is no longer in my hands replied Villefort	131.9298553466797
And desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt	82.14624786376953
But remorse is not thus banished like Virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair	62.041751861572266
Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart	61.15650177001953
The man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death	109.72341918945312
Then he had a moments hesitation	1.004905104637146
He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	37.26066207885742
In this case he was not the judge but the executioner	254.4434814453125
As he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	23.220542907714844
It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but Villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	133.51255798339844
If at this moment the sweet voice of Rene had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair Mercds had entered and said In the name of God I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by Villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	136.07876586914062
Villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to M	18.190715789794922
de SaintMrans	86.07720184326172
The hapless Dants was doomed	115.30640411376953
As the marquis had promised Villefort found the marquise and Rene in waiting	74.09432220458984
He started when he saw Rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dants	125.06536102294922
Alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of Villeforts departure	212.3385467529297
She loved Villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband	226.17262268066406
Villefort knew not when he should return and Rene far from pleading for Dants hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover	1431.50048828125
0127 m	86.3282241821289
Meanwhile what of Mercds She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la Loge she had returned to the Catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch	245.5585174560547
Fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that Mercds did not even feel	93.56980895996094
She passed the night thus	25.062467575073242
The lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day	1.0273346900939941
Grief had made her blind to all but one objectthat was Edmond	290.0031433105469
Ah you are there said she at length turning towards Fernand	53.84538269042969
I have not quitted you since yesterday returned Fernand sorrowfully	97.81695556640625
Morrel had not readily given up the fight	275.87896728515625
He had learned that Dants had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that Dants was arrested as a Bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	193.5825653076172
Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like M	149.74322509765625
Morrel to aid Dants he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	106.04289245605469
But he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened	174.1743927001953
With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candlespectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punchdrenched pages like black fantastic dust	27.773569107055664
Danglars alone was content and joyoushe had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the Pharaon secure	23.47447967529297
Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	50.47096252441406
Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction	91.9517593383789
The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires	40.412933349609375
He went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	61.539955139160156
Villefort after having received M	114.34685516357422
de Salvieuxs letter embraced Rene kissed the marquises hand and shaken that of the marquis started for Paris along the Aix road	144.0055694580078
Old Dants was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond	89.56427001953125
But we know very well what had become of Edmond	61.39217758178711
Chapter 10	88.33149719238281
The Kings Closet at the Tuileries	127.84391784667969
We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris travellingthanks to trebled feeswith all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII	56.89640426635742
and now of Louis Philippe	67.18896484375
There seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from Hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king Louis XVIII	215.3843536376953
was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fiftytwo years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphiuss rather inaccurate but much soughtafter edition of Horacea work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch	1.0436005592346191
You say sir said the king	136.87510681152344
That I am exceedingly disquieted sire	283.2940368652344
Really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine	46.3447380065918
No sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared	39.0620002746582
Then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear Blacas	40.226104736328125
Sire I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south	155.9813690185547
Well my dear duke replied Louis XVIII	64.67920684814453
I think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction	42.840389251708984
Man of ability as he was Louis XVIII	127.31659698486328
liked a pleasant jest	32.579036712646484
Sire continued M	17.28070831298828
de Blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into Languedoc Provence and Dauphin trusty men who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces	60.23113250732422
Canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his Horace	86.07720184326172
Sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of France but I fear I am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt	71.55885314941406
By whom	71.22442626953125
By Bonaparte or at least by his adherents	1985.04541015625
My dear Blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working	721.6102905273438
And you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security	271.1653747558594
Wait my dear sir wait a moment for I have such a delightful note on the Pastor quum traheretwait and I will listen to you afterwards	82.96824645996094
There was a brief pause during which Louis XVIII	54.67132568359375
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his Horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said	95.96590423583984
Go on my dear duke go onI listen	218.67385864257812
Sire said Blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing Villefort to his own profit I am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a seriousminded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so I hastened to you sire	82.3669204711914
Mala ducis avi domum continued Louis XVIII	91.15508270263672
still annotating	193.29544067382812
Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject	55.957069396972656
By no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand	93.8124771118164
Whichever you pleasethere to the left	42.69453048706055
Here sire	93.22630310058594
I tell you to the left and you are looking to the right I mean on my leftyes there	303.41131591796875
You will find yesterdays report of the minister of police	64.7983627319336
But here is M	83.93892669677734
Dandr himself and M	319.6576232910156
Dandr announced by the chamberlaininwaiting entered	283.2940368652344
Come in said Louis XVIII	127.30262756347656
with repressed smile come in Baron and tell the duke all you knowthe latest news of M	98.39540100097656
de Bonaparte do not conceal anything however seriouslet us see the Island of Elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling warbella horrida bella	56.73544692993164
Dandr leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands and said	103.22596740722656
Has your majesty perused yesterdays report	114.86212158203125
Yes yes but tell the duke himself who can not find anything what the report containsgive him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet	105.7247543334961
Monsieur said the baron to the duke all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island of Elba	74.7032241821289
Dandr looked at Louis XVIII	325.5618591308594
who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head	358.4665832519531
Bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at PortoLongone	12.420124053955078
And scratches himself for amusement added the king	232.67868041992188
Scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean	64.95616912841797
Yes indeed my dear duke	68.92459869384766
Did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo	36.74694061279297
And moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane	260.0317687988281
Raving mad his head becomes weaker	111.44365692138672
Sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duckanddrake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz	575.80810546875
Now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity	80.4521713256836
Or of wisdom my dear baronor of wisdom said Louis XVIII	127.1489028930664
laughing the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the oceansee Plutarchs life of Scipio Africanus	38.39928436279297
de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister	127.29151916503906
Villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness	80.62599182128906
Well well Dandr said Louis XVIII	62.27982711791992
Blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurpers conversion	285.4669189453125
The minister of police bowed	75.31326293945312
The usurpers conversion murmured the duke looking at the king and Dandr who spoke alternately like Virgils shepherds	77.52779388427734
The usurper converted	96.58708953857422
Decidedly my dear duke	247.59115600585938
In what way converted	9.941791534423828
To good principles	285.595703125
Tell him all about it baron	108.35050964355469
Why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world Napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king	170.5487060546875
These were his own words of that I am certain	19.201669692993164
Well Blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him	635.5247802734375
I say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that I am in error	770.9676513671875
However sire if I might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you and I will urge your majesty to do him this honor	6.462138652801514
Most willingly duke under your auspices I will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding	58.670616149902344
Baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th February and this is the 3rd of March	245.68453979492188
No sire but I am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since I left my office	45.504547119140625
Go thither and if there be nonewell well continued Louis XVIII	62.06660461425781
make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously	41.70738220214844
Oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions	127.649658203125
Well sir go said Louis XVIII	153.73387145996094
and remember that I am waiting for you	110.08879852294922
I will but go and return sire I shall be back in ten minutes	54.95397186279297
And I sire said M	207.9151611328125
de Blacas will go and find my messenger	221.07180786132812
Wait sir wait said Louis XVIII	129.99835205078125
Really M	69.10899353027344
de Blacas I must change your armorial bearings I will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this deviceTenax	51.50230407714844
0133 m	42.144195556640625
Sire I listen said De Blacas biting his nails with impatience	59.44508743286133
I wish to consult you on this passage Molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf	9.631996154785156
Are you not a sportsman and a great wolfhunter Well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu	261.7140808105469
Admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days	38.443302154541016
Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath	28.84459114074707
Ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information	104.3736572265625
If only for the sake of M	183.61874389648438
de Salvieux who recommends him to me I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously	204.9374542236328
de Salvieux my brothers chamberlain	64.7684326171875
Yes sire	164.07907104492188
He is at Marseilles	411.93023681640625
And writes me thence	280.7839660644531
Does he speak to you of this conspiracy	108.95580291748047
No but strongly recommends M	59.16410827636719
de Villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty	98.2809829711914
de Villefort cried the king is the messengers name M	96.56189727783203
de Villefort	33.881954193115234
Yes sire	77.07547760009766
And he comes from Marseilles	80.43733215332031
In person	56.675392150878906
Why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	1209.6983642578125
Sire I thought his name was unknown to your majesty	555.2169189453125
No no Blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu you know his fathers name	207.39215087890625
His father	93.21310424804688
Yes Noirtier	1.7159162759780884
Noirtier the GirondinNoirtier the senator	138.73309326171875
He himself	468.12396240234375
And your majesty has employed the son of such a man	77.94023132324219
Blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	97.81840515136719
I told you Villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything even his father	260.8511962890625
Then sire may I present him	345.99542236328125
This instant duke Where is he	511.8186340332031
Waiting below in my carriage	183.0297393798828
Seek him at once	1.0086705684661865
I hasten to do so	125.68255615234375
The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	251.93846130371094
Louis XVIII	108.11048126220703
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened Horace muttered	42.587890625
Justum et tenacem propositi virum	108.9168930053711
de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	103.51964569091797
Villeforts dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of M	35.229530334472656
de Brez who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire	74.91647338867188
The duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles Villefort was introduced	81.94945526123047
The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him	107.26931762695312
On opening the door Villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrates first impulse was to pause	219.52491760253906
Come in M	38.761474609375
de Villefort said the king come in	47.05511474609375
Villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interrogate him	13.472140312194824
de Villefort said Louis XVIII	16.850801467895508
the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate	50.572628021240234
Sire the duke is right and I believe your majesty will think it equally important	179.8165283203125
0137 m	506.96826171875
In the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe	95.00430297851562
Sire I believe it to be most urgent but I hope by the speed I have used that it is not irreparable	242.8922882080078
Speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacass face and affected Villeforts voice	96.615234375
Speak sir and pray begin at the beginning I like order in everything	1.4501068592071533
Sire said Villefort I will render a faithful report to your majesty but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language	178.87811279296875
A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on	13.020130157470703
Sire I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible to inform your majesty that I have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracya storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	19.346582412719727
Sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible	21.742345809936523
At this moment he will have left Elba to go whither I know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples or on the coast of Tuscany or perhaps on the shores of France	121.65815734863281
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France	176.12669372558594
I am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue SaintJacques	54.73311996459961
But proceed I beg of you	70.62834167480469
How did you obtain these details	22.96615982055664
Sire they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles whom I have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure	148.02627563476562
This person a sailor of turbulent character and whom I suspected of Bonapartism has been secretly to the Island of Elba	306.6421203613281
There he saw the grandmarshal who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris whose name I could not extract from him but this mission was to prepare mens minds for a return it is the man who says this sirea return which will soon occur	445.33526611328125
And where is this man	7.569088459014893
In prison sire	58.84154510498047
And the matter seems serious to you	105.66801452636719
So serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival on the very day of my betrothal I left my bride and friends postponing everything that I might hasten to lay at your majestys feet the fears which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion	436.9891357421875
True said Louis XVIII	90.51888275146484
was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de SaintMran	63.76991653442383
Daughter of one of your majestys most faithful servants	176.10755920410156
Yes yes but let us talk of this plot M	9.76907730102539
de Villefort	142.64785766601562
Sire I fear it is more than a plot I fear it is a conspiracy	53.858734130859375
A conspiracy in these times said Louis XVIII	168.90370178222656
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as reestablished so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future	20.568382263183594
For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean	61.24767303466797
If Bonaparte landed at Naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino if he land in Tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in France it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	55.63999938964844
Take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude	54.02637481689453
Ah here is M	49.62879943847656
Dandr cried de Blacas	25.093732833862305
At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	180.31056213378906
Villefort was about to retire but M	83.0899887084961
de Blacas taking his hand restrained him	48.463871002197266
Chapter 11	125.52987670898438
The Corsican Ogre	17.21827507019043
At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII	134.9113311767578
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting	76.63618469238281
What ails you baron he exclaimed	93.07878875732422
You appear quite aghast	255.38101196289062
Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M	82.77627563476562
de Blacas has told me and M	49.401065826416016
de Villefort has just confirmed M	405.9000244140625
de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect	154.1611785888672
Sire stammered the baron	488.5174865722656
Well what is it asked Louis XVIII	46.515743255615234
The minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII	66.8857421875
who retreated a step and frowned	112.09407043457031
Will you speak he said	103.92764282226562
Oh sire what a dreadful misfortune I am indeed to be pitied	57.47576904296875
I can never forgive myself	114.30760192871094
Monsieur said Louis XVIII	70.08940124511719
I command you to speak	640.5474853515625
Well sire the usurper left Elba on the 26th February and landed on the 1st of March	106.15449523925781
And where In Italy asked the king eagerly	39.52608108520508
In France sireat a small port near Antibes in the Gulf of Juan	17.002412796020508
The usurper landed in France near Antibes in the Gulf of Juan two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris on the 1st of March and you only acquired this information today the 3rd of March Well sir what you tell me is impossible	103.56779479980469
You must have received a false report or you have gone mad	7.431787490844727
Alas sire it is but too true Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance	296.9671936035156
In France he cried the usurper in France Then they did not watch over this man	49.421634674072266
Who knows they were perhaps in league with him	268.58331298828125
Oh sire exclaimed the Duc de Blacas M	204.83604431152344
Dandr is not a man to be accused of treason Sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all	44.06883239746094
But said Villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued Your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	426.68865966796875
Will your majesty deign to excuse me	87.92131805419922
Speak sir speak boldly replied Louis	733.2803344726562
You alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy	121.42008972167969
Sire said Villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him	58.58266830444336
Yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron	72.55999755859375
Advancinghe is advancing said Louis XVIII	49.194190979003906
Is he then advancing on Paris The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal	95.15568542480469
And Dauphin sir inquired the king of Villefort	109.92723846435547
Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence	189.6621856689453
Sire I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in Dauphin is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc	70.90159606933594
The mountaineers are Bonapartists sire	348.46490478515625
Then murmured Louis he was well informed	206.121337890625
And how many men had he with him	57.71035385131836
I do not know sire answered the minister of police	1.7159162759780884
What you do not know Have you neglected to obtain information on that point Of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile	143.60765075683594
Sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper	90.15988159179688
And how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	277.7125244140625
The minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out	66.84923553466797
By the telegraph sire	1703.2635498046875
Louis XVIII	132.075439453125
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done	64.5877685546875
0141 m	151.38026428222656
So then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man	103.08907318115234
A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of exile	163.8164825439453
I have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me and now when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms	123.25157928466797
Sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	83.3039779663086
What our enemies say of us is then true	96.33851623535156
We have learnt nothing forgotten nothing If I were betrayed as he was I would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselvesfor my fortune is theirsbefore me they were nothingafter me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacityineptitude Oh yes sir you are rightit is fatality	185.1240997314453
The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm	98.15242767333984
de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow	76.02489471435547
Villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	213.29774475097656
To fall continued King Louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspendedto fall and learn of that fall by telegraph Oh I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother Louis XVI	271.50927734375
than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule	1.0081772804260254
Ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in France and yet you ought to know it	169.08316040039062
Sire sire murmured the minister for pitys	113.83709716796875
Approach M	119.87481689453125
de Villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom	225.3817596435547
Approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known	102.73188018798828
Sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world	503.38409423828125
Really impossible Yesthat is a great word sir	36.69590759277344
Unfortunately there are great words as there are great men I have measured them	99.62748718261719
Really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France Well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposala gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph	132.31692504882812
The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort who bent his head in modest triumph	290.2464904785156
I do not mean that for you Blacas continued Louis XVIII	84.2049560546875
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions	94.5041275024414
Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M	144.53404235839844
de Villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition	87.70939636230469
These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before	304.9335021972656
Villefort understood the kings intent	296.9429626464844
Any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that Dandr was irrevocably lost	69.35556030273438
In fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth Napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dants and so lay bare the motives of Villeforts plot	127.93233489990234
Realizing this Villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush him	109.18729400634766
Sire said Villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and I have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servantthats all	188.32598876953125
Do not attribute to me more than I deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me	325.7440185546875
The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely	180.13095092773438
Tis well resumed the king	123.60517883300781
And now gentlemen he continued turning towards M	330.9449157714844
de Blacas and the minister of police I have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war	30.442790985107422
Fortunately sire said M	46.641597747802734
de Blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment	26.428348541259766
Do not mention reports duke to me for I know now what confidence to place in them	53.01179885864258
Yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue SaintJacques	269.8055725097656
The affair in the Rue SaintJacques exclaimed Villefort unable to repress an exclamation	70.76095581054688
Then suddenly pausing he added Your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect I have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette	234.51678466796875
Go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here	63.74811553955078
Sire interposed the minister of police I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty	196.28903198242188
On the contrary siron the contrary said Louis XVIII	89.46964263916016
this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy	96.67445373535156
At the name of General Quesnel Villefort trembled	87.16950225830078
Everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination	276.67425537109375
General Quesnel it appears had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared	115.595703125
An unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the Rue SaintJacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number	123.83029174804688
As the police minister related this to the king Villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale	312.4207763671875
The king looked towards him	20.37880516052246
Do you not think with me M	91.0975112915039
de Villefort that General Quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush	33.37120819091797
It is probable sire replied Villefort	95.93986511230469
But is this all that is known	78.09048461914062
They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him	22.647401809692383
On his track said Villefort	74.08824920654297
Yes the servant has given his description	100.07498931884766
He is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache	191.17660522460938
He was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor	59.436668395996094
Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue CoqHron	116.41009521484375
Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again	596.0335693359375
Continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as I am all but convinced General Quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins Bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished	195.72499084472656
It required all Villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him	112.90904235839844
How strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say A murder has been committed and especially so when they can add And we are on the track of the guilty persons	175.94143676757812
Sire your majesty will I trust be amply satisfied on this point at least	161.59165954589844
We shall see	28.97770118713379
I will no longer detain you M	37.508033752441406
de Villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest	142.060302734375
Of course you stopped at your fathers A feeling of faintness came over Villefort	93.84263610839844
0145 m	98.99788665771484
No sire he replied I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid in the Rue de Tournon	233.79039001464844
But you have seen him	168.55789184570312
Sire I went straight to the Duc de Blacas	45.287471771240234
But you will see him then	53.423702239990234
I think not sire	41.42523956298828
Ah I forgot said Louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive I forgot you and M	137.33619689941406
Noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed	124.88932037353516
Sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for	110.75776672363281
Never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	35.381961822509766
In the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of St	64.25775146484375
Louis above the order of NotreDameduMontCarmel and St	160.3043975830078
Lazare and gave it to Villefortin the meanwhile take this cross	97.04315185546875
Sire said Villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross	114.61421966552734
Ma foi said Louis XVIII	78.06773376464844
take it such as it is for I have not the time to procure you another	141.57273864746094
Blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M	95.0886001586914
de Villefort	193.40505981445312
Villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it	30.87787437438965
And now he said may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me	149.84152221679688
Take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in Paris you may be of the greatest service to me at Marseilles	230.5535430908203
Sire replied Villefort bowing in an hour I shall have quitted Paris	44.894351959228516
Go sir said the king and should I forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection	75.44733428955078
Baron send for the minister of war	210.97494506835938
Blacas remain	32.21697998046875
Ah sir said the minister of police to Villefort as they left the Tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is made	86.88473510742188
Will it be long first muttered Villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneycoach	37.30740737915039
One passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition	46.380760192871094
Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him	367.4419250488281
He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	111.87055206298828
The valet opened the door and Villefort heard someone speak his name	32.371726989746094
0147 m	90.45697021484375
Who could know that I was here already said the young man	10703.8466796875
The valet entered	117.790771484375
Well said Villefort what is itWho rangWho asked for me	35.88138961791992
A stranger who will not send in his name	149.9600372314453
A stranger who will not send in his name What can he want with me	344.0617980957031
He wishes to speak to you	70.34939575195312
To me	60.554039001464844
Did he mention my name	37.37098693847656
What sort of person is he	417.42596435546875
Why sir a man of about fifty	110.97520446777344
Short or tall	133.1873779296875
About your own height sir	29.061771392822266
Dark or fair	240.43643188476562
Darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows	213.1345672607422
And how dressed asked Villefort quickly	86.71466827392578
In a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the Legion of Honor	53.55277633666992
It is he said Villefort turning pale	40.55696487426758
0148 m	35.25857925415039
Eh pardieu said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony Is it the custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms	54.62379455566406
Father cried Villefort then I was not deceived I felt sure it must be you	206.91514587402344
Well then if you felt so sure replied the newcomer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear Grard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door	70.3374252319336
Leave us Germain said Villefort	118.0965576171875
The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment	38.65346908569336
Chapter 12	107.56890106201172
Father and Son	15.507661819458008
Noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	57.32876205444336
Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to Villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	49.34028625488281
Well now my dear Grard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me	65.43488311767578
My dear father said Villefort I am on the contrary delighted but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	80.85521697998047
But my dear fellow replied M	159.4806671142578
Noirtier seating himself I might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris	29.966073989868164
And if I have come my dear father said Grard drawing closer to M	36.851783752441406
Noirtier do not complain for it is for you that I came and my journey will be your salvation	109.22306823730469
Ah indeed said M	389.93536376953125
Noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair	217.2777557373047
Really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting	110.91240692138672
Father you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue SaintJacques	186.14852905273438
53 yes I am vicepresident	33.87111282348633
Father your coolness makes me shudder	34.97553634643555
Why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from Paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things	30.012693405151367
But go on what about the club in the Rue SaintJacques	63.445167541503906
Why they induced General Quesnel to go there and General Quesnel who quitted his own house at nine oclock in the evening was found the next day in the Seine	268.9008483886719
0151 m	1.0026277303695679
And who told you this fine story	43.38325881958008
The king himself	289.0501708984375
Well then in return for your story continued Noirtier I will tell you another	51.0816535949707
My dear father I think I already know what you are about to tell me	42.72897720336914
Ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor	100.61260986328125
Not so loud father I entreat of youfor your own sake as well as mine	41.044822692871094
Yes I heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced delay	180.9249725341797
Three days ago You are crazy	78.48001861572266
Why three days ago the emperor had not landed	228.24649047851562
No matter I was aware of his intention	170.40415954589844
How did you know about it	182.7588653564453
By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba	32.875526428222656
To me	145.11016845703125
To you and which I discovered in the pocketbook of the messenger	185.42413330078125
Had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot	1158.694091796875
Villeforts father laughed	557.958740234375
Come come said he will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly Shot my dear boy What an idea Where is the letter you speak of I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you	134.2113800048828
I burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation	26.284423828125
And the destruction of your future prospects replied Noirtier yes I can easily comprehend that	59.371036529541016
But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect me	102.11640930175781
I do better than that sirI save you	75.77626037597656
You do Why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself	65.50263214111328
I must refer again to the club in the Rue SaintJacques	83.31188201904297
It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police	70.16818237304688
Why did nt they search more vigilantly they would have found	60.16901397705078
They have not found but they are on the track	89.12257385253906
Yes that the usual phrase I am quite familiar with it	77.18147277832031
When the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost	128.17156982421875
Yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder	113.18783569335938
A murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	1.0345239639282227
People are found every day in the Seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim	22.73988151550293
Father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of January	96.42142486572266
No no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word	82.00930786132812
And who thus designated it	25.657150268554688
The king himself	136.44235229492188
The king I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics	255.51206970214844
In politics my dear fellow you know as well as I do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all	693.8527221679688
Would you like to know how matters have progressed Well I will tell you	41.64410400390625
It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba one of us went to him and invited him to the Rue SaintJacques where he would find some friends	94.26151275634766
He came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba the projected landing etc	174.47705078125
When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	578.5661010742188
Then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly free	287.01690673828125
Yet he did not return home	484.4288330078125
What could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all	176.2742462158203
A murder really Villefort you surprise me	74.43618774414062
You a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises Did I ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party My son you have committed a murder No I said Very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn	227.7238006591797
But father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping	197.8933563232422
I do not understand you	66.01001739501953
You rely on the usurpers return	21.742345809936523
We do	75.36837768554688
You are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast	538.6311645507812
My dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons and on the 20th or 25th at Paris	83.1391372680664
The people will rise	311.2254638671875
Yes to go and meet him	387.1930236816406
He has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him	243.61886596679688
Yes to escort him into the capital	292.72833251953125
Really my dear Grard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing The usurper has landed at Cannes with several men	211.08242797851562
He is pursued	104.8048095703125
But where is he what is he doing You do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to Paris without drawing a trigger	280.80621337890625
Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier	79.56429290771484
Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall Lyons will hasten to welcome him	391.7429504394531
Believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	2270.27099609375
Would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier	110.2801513671875
You gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet I have your address and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	405.2850036621094
Ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together	116.78838348388672
Indeed replied Villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed	141.9062042236328
Eh the thing is simple enough	136.45712280273438
You who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts	318.8244934082031
Devotion said Villefort with a sneer	356.7894287109375
Yes devotion for that is I believe the phrase for hopeful ambition	124.66138458251953
And Villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	132.98475646972656
Villefort caught his arm	120.87033081054688
Wait my dear father said the young man one word more	130.14993286132812
Say on	203.17620849609375
However stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing	164.72299194335938
What is that	64.52740478515625
The description of the man who on the morning of the day when General Quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house	292.8939208984375
Oh the admirable police have found that out have they And what may be that description	226.1909637451172
Dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in his buttonhole a hat with wide brim and a cane	54.81772232055664
Ah ha that s it is it said Noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him	244.64666748046875
Because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue CoqHron	123.93467712402344
Did nt I say that your police were good for nothing	121.2627182006836
Yes but they may catch him yet	86.13176727294922
True said Noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile He will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance	2026.2559814453125
At these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers	86.90422058105469
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	643.2032470703125
His whiskers cut off Noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and highbuttoned frockcoat a coat of Villeforts of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrowbrimmed hat of his sons which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics	356.1107177734375
Well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now	277.8694763183594
No father stammered Villefort at least I hope not	496.90521240234375
And now my dear boy continued Noirtier I rely on your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your care	455.9847717285156
Oh rely on me said Villefort	74.37651062011719
Yes yes and now I believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured I will return the favor hereafter	68.09351348876953
Villefort shook his head	169.77276611328125
You are not convinced yet	145.0582275390625
I hope at least that you may be mistaken	515.7037963867188
Shall you see the king again	202.5570068359375
Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet	224.7891845703125
Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father	43.467079162597656
True but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man	114.27838897705078
Well what should I say to the king	303.93536376953125
Say this to him Sire you are deceived as to the feeling in France as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre who at Nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons and emperor at Grenoble	171.9483184814453
You think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles	56.9861946105957
The soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward	133.83209228515625
Sire go leave France to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcola Marengo Austerlitz	61.6317253112793
Tell him this Grard or rather tell him nothing	89.7016830444336
Keep your journey a secret do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do or have done return with all speed enter Marseilles at night and your house by the backdoor and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive for this time I swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies	126.58666229248047
Go my songo my dear Grard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place	123.19429016113281
This will be added Noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down	66.6558609008789
Adieu my dear Grard and at your next journey alight at my door	179.47720336914062
Noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation	49.555660247802734
Villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three illlooking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frockcoat and hat with broad brim	102.08885192871094
Villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the Rue Bussy	157.44651794433594
Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frockcoat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travellingcap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached Marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes	1.026984691619873
Chapter 13	38.94362258911133
The Hundred Days	63.6070442199707
Noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted	113.19081115722656
Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future	134.32437133789062
Louis XVIII	208.6749725341797
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	96.04634094238281
Villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the Legion of Honor which he had the prudence not to wear although M	80.55229187011719
de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet	548.5987548828125
Napoleon would doubtless have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the Girondin of 93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector	150.47476196289062
All Villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret Dants had so nearly divulged	118.25016021728516
The kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	315.5638732910156
However scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there Louis XVIII	51.261512756347656
s halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when Marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	102.32659149169922
0159 m	341.7440490722656
Owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of Dants	48.19056701660156
Villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity	130.3699493408203
If the emperor remained on the throne Grard required a different alliance to aid his career if Louis XVIII	163.32977294921875
returned the influence of M	135.16213989257812
de SaintMran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	143.18357849121094
The deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of Marseilles when one morning his door opened and M	72.7178726196289
Morrel was announced	110.57945251464844
Anyone else would have hastened to receive him but Villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	255.50013732910156
He made Morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered M	181.34120178222656
Morrel to be admitted	354.76568603515625
Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	92.68704223632812
He had entered Villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand	33.63570022583008
He stopped at the door Villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands	254.21548461914062
Morrel I believe said Villefort	52.64305877685547
Yes sir	54.79723358154297
Come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit	98.03717041015625
Do you not guess monsieur asked Morrel	82.44601440429688
Not in the least but if I can serve you in any way I shall be delighted	194.05770874023438
Everything depends on you	68.07854461669922
Explain yourself pray	243.08763122558594
Monsieur said Morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor I came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of Elba What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor	197.00439453125
You then served Louis XVIII	72.0938949584961
and you did not show any favorit was your duty today you serve Napoleon and you ought to protect himit is equally your duty I come therefore to ask what has become of him	263.73504638671875
0161 m	107.42420196533203
Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself	432.6211242675781
What is his name said he	17.959766387939453
Tell me his name	207.82901000976562
Edmond Dants	49.17547607421875
Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fiveandtwenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch	93.8931655883789
Dants repeated he Edmond Dants	154.43943786621094
Yes monsieur	4980.52392578125
Villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to Morrel	75.59808349609375
Are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world	111.57978057861328
Had Morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	94.71309661865234
But Morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	92.56809997558594
Villefort had calculated rightly	30.28643226623535
No said Morrel I am not mistaken	183.91624450683594
I have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	130.65341186523438
Do not you recollect I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as I come today to plead for justice	68.4169921875
You received me very coldly	118.50122833251953
Oh the royalists were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days	130.5636749267578
Monsieur returned Villefort I was then a royalist because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation	337.5386962890625
The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people	72.60098266601562
That s right cried Morrel	168.50180053710938
I like to hear you speak thus and I augur well for Edmond from it	73.5543212890625
Wait a moment said Villefort turning over the leaves of a register I have ita sailor who was about to marry a young Catalan girl	46.316978454589844
I recollect now it was a very serious charge	185.9506072998047
How so	84.70867919921875
You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice	156.95733642578125
I made my report to the authorities at Paris and a week after he was carried off	111.73577880859375
Carried off said Morrel	301.2121276855469
What can they have done with him	1.0076717138290405
Oh he has been taken to Fenestrelles to Pignerol or to the SainteMargurite islands	66.69001007080078
Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel	78.20011138916016
Come when he will it shall be kept for him	136.36572265625
But how is it he is not already returned It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it	232.2422637939453
Do not be too hasty M	65.94684600830078
Morrel replied Villefort	289.7452392578125
The order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded	135.31069946289062
But said Morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest	67.39200592041016
There has been no arrest	298.59185791015625
It is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes	134.91680908203125
It might be so under the Bourbons but at present	333.45068359375
It has always been so my dear Morrel since the reign of Louis XIV	70.92167663574219
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable	135.43148803710938
Had Morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	175.1748046875
Well M	101.11009979248047
de Villefort how would you advise me to act asked he	134.9547119140625
Petition the minister	84.50030517578125
Oh I know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three	117.87493896484375
That is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me	280.2327575683594
And will you undertake to deliver it	77.34217834472656
With the greatest pleasure	1.075545072555542
Dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him	102.99085235595703
Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless	93.82818603515625
But how shall I address the minister	53.65309524536133
Sit down there said Villefort giving up his place to Morrel and write what I dictate	68.09809112548828
Will you be so good	468.2767028808594
But lose no time we have lost too much already	39.229679107666016
That is true	274.866455078125
Only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering	68.45148468017578
Villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	65.17042541503906
Dants must be crushed to gratify Villeforts ambition	148.30117797851562
Villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt Dants patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleons return	217.1784210205078
It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him	35.03647994995117
The petition finished Villefort read it aloud	134.1305694580078
That will do said he leave the rest to me	61.76487731933594
Will the petition go soon	125.861572265625
Countersigned by you	73.90049743652344
The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition	246.98825073242188
And sitting down Villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom	133.42581176757812
What more is to be done	160.23745727539062
I will do whatever is necessary	29.748994827270508
This assurance delighted Morrel who took leave of Villefort and hastened to announce to old Dants that he would soon see his son	32.429222106933594
As for Villefort instead of sending to Paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dants in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	144.66552734375
Dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII	72.05046081542969
s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	63.888526916503906
Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand and twice had Villefort soothed him with promises	165.67962646484375
At last there was Waterloo and Morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly	158.06651306152344
Louis XVIII	151.29249572753906
remounted the throne Villefort to whom Marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of kings procureur at Toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married Mademoiselle de SaintMran whose father now stood higher at court than ever	631.672119140625
And so Dants after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven	234.7134552001953
Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dants and when Napoleon returned to France he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of Providence	64.59562683105469
But when Napoleon returned to Paris Danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of Dants return on a mission of vengeance	133.0262908935547
He therefore informed M	80.84215545654297
Morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of March that is ten or twelve days after Napoleons return	185.5126495361328
He then left for Madrid and was no more heard of	107.85812377929688
Fernand understood nothing except that Dants was absent	52.468482971191406
What had become of him he cared not to inquire	53.545166015625
Only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving Mercds as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of Cape Pharo at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	109.82936096191406
Fernands mind was made up he would shoot Dants and then kill himself	1.0045255422592163
But Fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	62.20770263671875
During this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor	59.55820846557617
Fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercds	58.07017135620117
Had Fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from Mercds	131.41769409179688
His devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsMercds had always had a sincere regard for Fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude	74.83699798583984
My brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed I shall be alone in the world	13.797502517700195
These words carried a ray of hope into Fernands heart	43.88996124267578
Should Dants not return Mercds might one day be his	117.23167419433594
0165 m	66.05709075927734
Mercds was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast	92.09217071533203
Bathed in tears she wandered about the Catalan village	69.29672241210938
Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards Marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes	21.742345809936523
It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her	1054.5322265625
Caderousse was like Fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier	2229.89697265625
Old Dants who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at Napoleons downfall	73.51673126220703
Five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in Mercds arms	32.41948699951172
Morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted	126.38201904296875
There was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a Bonapartist as Dants was stigmatized as a crime	93.55543518066406
Chapter 14	305.3758544921875
The Two Prisoners	82.65602111816406
A year after Louis XVIII	37.68149948120117
s restoration a visit was made by the inspectorgeneral of prisons	48.75141525268555
Dants in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	2470.7978515625
He guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead	137.00119018554688
The inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government	183.112060546875
He inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	81.38996124267578
The universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free	104.74100494384766
The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	77.72196960449219
They shook their heads	167.23611450195312
What could they desire beyond their liberty The inspector turned smilingly to the governor	248.56529235839844
I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see allalways the same thingill fed and innocent	4768.5888671875
Are there any others	213.37025451660156
Yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons	216.14280700683594
Let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue	20.51576805114746
We must play the farce to the end	11.4669189453125
Let us see the dungeons	122.44291687011719
Let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	224.08233642578125
The prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim	104.17130279541016
Take all needful precautions replied the inspector	46.132171630859375
Two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to sight smell and respiration	59.366676330566406
Oh cried the inspector who can live here	153.15029907226562
A most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute	110.5426025390625
He is alone	34.44281768798828
How long has he been there	241.5901641845703
Nearly a year	47.448543548583984
Was he placed here when he first arrived	340.39483642578125
No not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him	38.79093933105469
To kill the turnkey	167.24888610839844
Yes the very one who is lighting us	42.18503189086914
Is it not true Antoine asked the governor	170.08544921875
True enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	30.395822525024414
He must be mad said the inspector	76.89105987548828
He is worse than thathe is a devil returned the turnkey	51.44498062133789
Shall I complain of him demanded the inspector	53.95520782470703
Oh no it is useless	86.68350219726562
Besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so	8.4226655960083
So much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	81.56615447998047
He was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office	32.14774703979492
You are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject	26.385969161987305
Now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abb formerly leader of a party in Italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing	46.30201721191406
He used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat	52.44230651855469
You had better see him for his madness is amusing	35.29201889038086
I will see them both returned the inspector I must conscientiously perform my duty	102.21574401855469
This was the inspectors first visit he wished to display his authority	633.0947875976562
Let us visit this one first added he	27.57332992553711
By all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	54.67823791503906
At the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges Dants who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	55.864479064941406
Seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded Dants who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands	194.32623291015625
The soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps	69.79118347167969
Dants saw that he was looked upon as dangerous	113.95668029785156
Then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity	120.40300750732422
The inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed He will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything I made some curious observations on this at Charenton	34.6937255859375
Then turning to the prisoner What is it you want said he	70.53033447265625
I want to know what crime I have committedto be tried and if I am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty	86.7134780883789
Are you well fed said the inspector	320.0760192871094
I believe so I do nt know its of no consequence	115.11187744140625
What matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners	49.909690856933594
You are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey	62.13874435424805
It is true sir and I beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but I was mad	105.35049438476562
And you are not so any longer	66.13865661621094
No captivity has subdued meI have been here so long	66.01800537109375
So longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	22.09830093383789
The 28th of February 1815 at halfpast two in the afternoon	183.88546752929688
Today is the 30th of July 1816why it is but seventeen months	89.2364501953125
Only seventeen months replied Dants	72.31427764892578
Oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prisonseventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambitionto a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instantwho sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living Seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited	97.62190246582031
Have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdicta trial sir I ask only for a trial that surely can not be denied to one who is accused	200.62210083007812
We shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor On my word the poor devil touches me	90.35234069824219
You must show me the proofs against him	35.455108642578125
Certainly but you will find terrible charges	841.236083984375
Monsieur continued Dants I know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all I ask	51.35079574584961
Let me know my crime and the reason why I was condemned	98.51473999023438
Uncertainty is worse than all	51.15066909790039
Go on with the lights said the inspector	55.14349365234375
Monsieur cried Dants I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope	46.458683013916016
I can not tell you that replied the inspector I can only promise to examine into your case	1.0166529417037964
Oh I am freethen I am saved	771.8556518554688
Who arrested you	114.19847869873047
See him and hear what he says	116.18206024169922
Villefort is no longer at Marseilles he is now at Toulouse	60.617881774902344
I am no longer surprised at my detention murmured Dants since my only protector is removed	240.94061279296875
Had M	214.52757263183594
de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you	704.0436401367188
None on the contrary he was very kind to me	48.828189849853516
I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you	90.00167846679688
That is well wait patiently then	66.70435333251953
Dants fell on his knees and prayed earnestly	78.08720397949219
The door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with DantsHope	1.027895212173462
0173 m	81.65316772460938
Will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell	106.73387908935547
Let us visit them all said the inspector	199.81927490234375
If I once went up those stairs	72.29179382324219
I should never have the courage to come down again	46.02785873413086
Ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason	271.389404296875
What is his folly	103.19412231445312
He fancies he possesses an immense treasure	335.2247314453125
The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively	115.48892211914062
He is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions	132.03985595703125
How curiouswhat is his name	90.55946350097656
The Abb Faria	181.68161010742188
27 said the inspector	233.38449096679688
It is here unlock the door Antoine	77.3697280883789
The turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abb as the prisoner was usually called	306.3692321777344
In the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him	131.54966735839844
He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him	557.3872680664062
He did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present	136.0602569580078
He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him	312.75079345703125
What is it you want said the inspector	70.56593322753906
I monsieur replied the abb with an air of surpriseI want nothing	28.050884246826172
You do not understand continued the inspector I am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners	45.80195617675781
Oh that is different cried the abb and we shall understand each other I hope	190.58653259277344
There now whispered the governor it is just as I told you	127.86347961425781
Monsieur continued the prisoner I am the Abb Faria born at Rome	31.798004150390625
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadas secretary I was arrested why I know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government	1077.9483642578125
Why from the French government	24.00179100036621
Because I was arrested at Piombino and I presume that like Milan and Florence Piombino has become the capital of some French department	302.43011474609375
Ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from Italy	12.134272575378418
My information dates from the day on which I was arrested returned the Abb Faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Csar Borgia which was to make Italy a united kingdom	78.51741027832031
Monsieur returned the inspector Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly	39.90812301635742
It is the only means of rendering Italy strong happy and independent	179.67568969726562
Very possibly only I am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of	50.559532165527344
The food is the same as in other prisonsthat is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which I wish to speak of but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance	152.78311157226562
We are coming to the point whispered the governor	270.6744689941406
It is for that reason I am delighted to see you continued the abb although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change Newtons system	53.22360610961914
Could you allow me a few words in private	269.7242736816406
What did I tell you said the governor	267.8585205078125
You knew him returned the inspector with a smile	66.7027587890625
What you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing Faria	113.92169952392578
0175 m	111.79286193847656
But said the abb I would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions	61.03385543823242
The very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn	64.23970794677734
However continued Faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present	53.34921646118164
Unfortunately said the governor I know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity	63.06779861450195
Of course said he of what else should I speak	138.26702880859375
Inspector continued the governor I can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years	136.42861938476562
That proves returned the abb that you are like those of Holy Writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not	110.97477722167969
My dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated	182.19876098632812
The abbs eyes glistened he seized the inspectors hand	138.42543029785156
But what if I am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be lost	56.24134063720703
Had not government better profit by it I will offer six millions and I will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty	33.29969024658203
On my word said the inspector in a low tone had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad I should believe what he says	69.10441589355469
I am not mad replied Faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners	28.58043098449707
The treasure I speak of really exists and I offer to sign an agreement with you in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if I deceive you bring me here againI ask no more	249.63442993164062
The governor laughed	383.3677062988281
Is the spot far from here	16.880020141601562
A hundred leagues	136.4141845703125
It is not illplanned said the governor	67.42415618896484
If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping	449.843017578125
The scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbs plan has not even the merit of originality	135.30516052246094
Then turning to Faria I inquired if you are well fed said he	13.36788272857666
Swear to me replied Faria to free me if what I tell you prove true and I will stay here while you go to the spot	21.15365982055664
Are you well fed repeated the inspector	96.43720245361328
Monsieur you run no risk for as I told you I will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping	520.8050537109375
You do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently	16.725297927856445
Nor you to mine cried the abb	91.17386627197266
You will not accept my gold I will keep it for myself	107.6011734008789
You refuse me my liberty God will give it me	21.15365982055664
And the abb casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations	184.6805419921875
0177 m	71.36502838134766
What is he doing there said the inspector	84.89027404785156
Counting his treasures replied the governor	39.284149169921875
Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	50.45241165161133
They went out	81.85631561279297
The turnkey closed the door behind them	311.6253662109375
He was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector	150.3526153564453
Or dreamed he was and awoke mad	252.13169860839844
After all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here	158.2309112548828
So the matter ended for the Abb Faria	109.85858917236328
He remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	87.10575866699219
Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	468.6982116699219
But the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	72.34400939941406
They fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions	321.7286071777344
Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable	122.39737701416016
It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	151.40228271484375
As the Inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him	103.74810028076172
The very madness of the Abb Faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity	121.41267395019531
The inspector kept his word with Dants he examined the register and found the following note concerning him	284.7567138671875
Edmond Dants	188.7770538330078
Violent Bonapartist took an active part in the return from Elba	93.53540802001953
The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	510.8419189453125
This note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement	92.91488647460938
The inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote Nothing to be done	142.9073944091797
This visit had infused new vigor into Dants he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th July 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again	470.1961975097656
Days and weeks passed away then monthsDants still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight	388.7153015136719
This fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more	1.1446326971054077
Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and Dants began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	432.1487731933594
At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at Ham	322.0687561035156
He took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them Dants jailer	33.180606842041016
A new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead	25.89041519165039
This horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantshe was now number 34	109.3078384399414
Chapter 15	123.97859191894531
Number 34 and Number 27	238.39816284179688
Dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense	27.12946891784668
He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governors belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to God but to man	135.5788116455078
God is always the last resource	80.5684585571289
Unfortunates who ought to begin with God do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance	125.22510528564453
Dants asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement	65.70706176757812
He entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	576.4454345703125
His requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	145.69888305664062
He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something	76.96835327148438
Dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him	72.53612518310547
Often before his captivity Dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers	91.5826187133789
He now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder	69.08118438720703
The galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other	55.767730712890625
They were very happy	341.2825622558594
He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb	86.68519592285156
The jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man	1.0065051317214966
At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that Dants wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request	54.119625091552734
Dants had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to God	131.23464965820312
All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven He prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	186.3356475830078
He laid every action of his life before the Almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us	799.0347290039062
Yet in spite of his earnest prayers Dants remained a prisoner	206.64910888671875
Then gloom settled heavily upon him	158.85415649414062
Dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martins Babylonian pictures	46.36884307861328
He could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful	29.104894638061523
Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness No distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage	1491.8214111328125
He clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheardof fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante	72.62531280517578
Rage supplanted religious fervor	53.9474983215332
Dants uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thinga grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury	282.2994079589844
Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of Belshazzar	92.356201171875
He told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of Heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	87.4327621459961
He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness	44.87384796142578
By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide	55.341182708740234
Unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these	207.9462890625
Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	140.2228546142578
Once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction	92.36356353759766
This state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow	258.1552734375
There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity	103.3908462524414
Edmond found some solace in these ideas	111.84585571289062
All his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter	193.2074432373047
Dants reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge	80.8042221069336
Sometimes said he in my voyages when I was a man and commanded other men I have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings	164.62640380859375
Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	25.400768280029297
Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God	345.89300537109375
But I did so because I was happy because I had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because I was unwilling that I a creature made for the service of God should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	91.3248519897461
But now it is different I have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose I die after my own manner I die exhausted and brokenspirited as I fall asleep when I have paced three thousand times round my cellthat is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues	69.66912841796875
No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout garment	73.68807220458984
Two methods of selfdestruction were at his disposal	302.4411926269531
He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation	121.45836639404297
But the first was repugnant to him	62.299163818359375
Dants had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death	113.33712005615234
He resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	249.27403259277344
0185 m	246.68316650390625
Nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time	56.57788848876953
Dants said I wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die	172.95803833007812
When my morning and evening meals are brought thought he I will cast them out of the window and they will think that I have eaten them	121.85260009765625
He kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	100.82310485839844
Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed	143.4247283935547
Hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	944.1409912109375
It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate	96.38125610351562
He was still younghe was only four or fiveandtwentyhe had nearly fifty years to live	27.582462310791016
What unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty Then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary Tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it	46.764312744140625
He persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	35.43277359008789
The next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill	2962.9306640625
Edmond hoped he was dying	775.4395141601562
Thus the day passed away	75.36248016357422
Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the willothewisps that play about the marshes	80.80099487304688
It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death	55.25983428955078
Suddenly about nine oclock in the evening Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying	39.0927848815918
So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual Edmond raised his head and listened	271.178955078125
It was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	52.37599563598633
Although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss	100.80921173095703
Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them	108.95787811279297
No no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death	137.02542114257812
Edmond still heard the sound	102.51344299316406
It lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	26.45623207092285
Some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct	81.97122192382812
Edmond was intensely interested	1.0161882638931274
Suddenly the jailer entered	15.301743507385254
For a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose Edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments	89.96958923339844
The jailer brought him his breakfast	114.7768783569336
Dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	259.5242614746094
Fortunately he fancied that Dants was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew	123.79730224609375
Edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct	54.357303619384766
There can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom	50.11469268798828
Oh if I were only there to help him	124.4359359741211
Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon	133.21812438964844
It was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question It was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity Unfortunately Edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular	228.043701171875
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	68.74600982666016
He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure	86.89539337158203
He had the resolution to stop with this	22.908044815063477
He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food	58.59392166137695
Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to die	98.796142578125
He soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	160.39332580566406
Then he said to himself	74.80548858642578
I must put this to the test but without compromising anybody	65.19463348388672
If it is a workman I need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it	166.44874572753906
If on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise I make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep	172.40667724609375
Edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came	116.724365234375
He struck thrice	223.10806274414062
At the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	92.02330017089844
Edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent there	248.18832397460938
Full of hope Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh recovered	351.9250183105469
The day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	150.4722442626953
It is a prisoner said Edmond joyfully	41.16102600097656
His brain was on fire and life and energy returned	172.67373657226562
The night passed in perfect silence	2496.22900390625
Edmond did not close his eyes	71.09148406982422
In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionshe had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny	147.4706268310547
At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself	1.016694188117981
Three days passedseventytwo long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes	79.7237548828125
At length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night Dants with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	189.1732635498047
He moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened	137.72903442382812
The matter was no longer doubtful	73.66793823242188
Something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel	261.7535400390625
Encouraged by this discovery Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer	320.9800720214844
He began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	79.7333755493164
He saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	154.3478546142578
All his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	91.96675872802734
The bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them off	52.713478088378906
The table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed	74.80484771728516
0189 m	283.4741516113281
Dants had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	148.83958435058594
He let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	139.2624053955078
Dants concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor	65.43295288085938
The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion	74.27838134765625
Edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for day	49.803768157958984
All night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way	90.90324401855469
Day came the jailer entered	637.6431884765625
Dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one	84.7962875366211
He returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed	6.724014759063721
Dants heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it	59.69986343383789
The damp had rendered it friable and Dants was able to break it offin small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed	266.74615478515625
The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency	96.53487396240234
During the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished	22.588905334472656
This idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stonework	77.69295501708984
The wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded	69.82024383544922
It was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	91.91735076904297
Dants strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak	74.69001007080078
The fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil Dants paused with anguish on his brow	123.64974975585938
Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task Suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead	93.53072357177734
The jailer always brought Dants soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for Dants had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first	198.35411071777344
The handle of this saucepan was of iron Dants would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	112.9508285522461
0191 m	202.6730499267578
The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dants plate and Dants after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day	101.74517059326172
Now when evening came Dants put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it	236.22271728515625
This time he could not blame Dants	130.70233154296875
He was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him	344.9531555175781
The jailer therefore only grumbled	115.69633483886719
Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into Dants entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	1052.2408447265625
Leave the saucepan said Dants you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast	171.08367919921875
This advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip	123.63872528076172
He left the saucepan	139.40936279296875
Dants was beside himself with joy	281.46966552734375
He rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever	100.50725555419922
A slight oscillation showed Dants that all went well	216.58966064453125
At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter	182.62924194335938
Dants carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth	88.93255615234375
Then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing	76.20611572265625
At the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down	44.58290100097656
The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table	184.35507202148438
Well do nt you intend to bring me another plate said Dants	178.6158447265625
No replied the turnkey you destroy everything	51.508766174316406
First you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined	90.12652587890625
I shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that	204.76416015625
So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive	104.1426010131836
Dants raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	124.43439483642578
He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything	81.0333023071289
He had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	51.34565353393555
All day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	112.58158111572266
When the hour for his jailers visit arrived Dants straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place	138.333251953125
The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat	159.26560974121094
This would have been a method of reckoning time had not Dants long ceased to do so	110.2132797241211
Having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	454.489990234375
Dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	115.08147430419922
He listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three days	177.8657989501953
Dants sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	499.6351623535156
However he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	57.89825439453125
The iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface Dants touched it and found that it was a beam	66.13392639160156
This beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole Dants had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it	140.852783203125
The unhappy young man had not thought of this	698.6134033203125
Oh my God my God murmured he I have so earnestly prayed to you that I hoped my prayers had been heard	44.9875373840332
After having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my God have pity on me and do not let me die in despair	49.23784255981445
0193 m	165.4906768798828
Who talks of God and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young mans ears	78.4606704711914
Edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his knees	77.904296875
Ah said he I hear a human voice	58.70747375488281
Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron	122.28898620605469
In the name of Heaven cried Dants speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me	76.37545776367188
Who are you	35.45375442504883
Who are you said the voice	80.10871887207031
An unhappy prisoner replied Dants who made no hesitation in answering	164.16751098632812
Of what country	88.67095947265625
A Frenchman	190.4711456298828
Your name	17.508481979370117
Edmond Dants	167.93470764160156
Your profession	102.33468627929688
A sailor	23.493146896362305
How long have you been here	121.37812042236328
Since the 28th of February 1815	83.42498016357422
Your crime	483.07916259765625
I am innocent	2486.3310546875
But of what are you accused	362.414794921875
Of having conspired to aid the emperors return	19.574146270751953
What For the emperors returnthe emperor is no longer on the throne then	386.01263427734375
He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814 and was sent to the Island of Elba	101.99829864501953
But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this	112.46907043457031
Since 1811	137.38604736328125
Dants shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	286.77203369140625
Do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation	79.59890747070312
On a level with the floor	214.54833984375
How is it concealed	687.786376953125
Behind my bed	20.74095916748047
Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner	10.32320499420166
What does your chamber open on	59.802547454833984
A corridor	70.3957748413086
And the corridor	58.41245651245117
On a court	30.765634536743164
Alas murmured the voice	34.08155059814453
Oh what is the matter cried Dants	38.940799713134766
I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	91.52005767822266
I took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended	107.54623413085938
I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress	146.859130859375
But then you would be close to the sea	83.28495025634766
That is what I hoped	146.92840576171875
And supposing you had succeeded	150.455322265625
I should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulenand then I should have been safe	330.2668762207031
Could you have swum so far	231.55723571777344
Heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost	30.194860458374023
Yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me	48.832672119140625
Tell me at least who you are	112.66121673583984
I amI am No	72.20842742919922
You mistrust me then said Dants	226.3429718017578
Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	227.19711303710938
Oh I am a Christian cried Dants guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him	109.32821655273438
I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but I conjure you do not abandon me	128.26742553710938
If you do I swear to you for I have got to the end of my strength that I will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with	81.58000183105469
How old are you Your voice is that of a young man	110.12612915039062
I do not know my age for I have not counted the years I have been here	41.91766357421875
All I do know is that I was just nineteen when I was arrested the 28th of February 1815	99.69810485839844
Not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he can not be a traitor	36.30677032470703
Oh no no cried Dants	96.73844909667969
I swear to you again rather than betray you I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces	186.04061889648438
You have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for I was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me	146.12393188476562
I will not forget you	69.3266372680664
How long	187.23171997070312
I must calculate our chances I will give you the signal	1224.9564208984375
But you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you	334.1435241699219
We will escape and if we can not escape we will talk you of those whom you love and I of those whom I love	58.91917419433594
You must love somebody	32.86260223388672
No I am alone in the world	189.3474578857422
Then you will love me	37.79446029663086
If you are young I will be your comrade if you are old I will be your son	831.6245727539062
I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives I only love him and a young girl called Mercds	75.10243225097656
My father has not yet forgotten me I am sure but God alone knows if she loves me still I shall love you as I loved my father	69.82024383544922
It is well returned the voice tomorrow	147.95126342773438
These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity Dants rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	102.90691375732422
He then gave himself up to his happiness	234.97482299804688
He would no longer be alone	108.96385192871094
He was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity	60.72651290893555
Plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven	108.4786605834961
All day Dants walked up and down his cell	49.33175277709961
He sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	202.44094848632812
At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	422.4519958496094
Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug	119.6923828125
He would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life	5.923106670379639
The jailer came in the evening	372.02288818359375
Dants was on his bed	200.3988494873047
It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening	387.5202941894531
Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said Come are you going mad again	14.390349388122559
Dants did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	146.02516174316406
The jailer went away shaking his head	99.09710693359375
Night came Dants hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken	17.26045036315918
The next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	74.0810317993164
Is it you said he I am here	91.01779174804688
Is your jailer gone	215.5981903076172
Yes said Dants he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us	29.463613510131836
I can work then said the voice	10.689953804016113
Oh yes yes this instant I entreat you	256.7039794921875
In a moment that part of the floor on which Dants was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	400.4910888671875
Then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	97.25953674316406
0197 m	4.769919395446777
Chapter 16	200.55523681640625
A Learned Italian	71.70832824707031
Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired Dants almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating	55.01144027709961
He was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age	47.55000305175781
He had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast	36.427215576171875
His thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength	43.96968460083008
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	46.047855377197266
The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	67.02554321289062
He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent	146.7889862060547
He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	88.76288604736328
Let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance hereour future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it	488.6148681640625
Advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said	124.40188598632812
You removed this stone very carelessly but I suppose you had no tools to aid you	119.19965362548828
Why exclaimed Dants with astonishment do you possess any	230.17555236816406
I made myself some and with the exception of a file I have all that are necessarya chisel pincers and lever	64.73298645019531
0201 m	65.31714630126953
Oh how I should like to see these products of your industry and patience	67.06538391113281
Well in the first place here is my chisel	208.957763671875
So saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood	105.93701171875
And with what did you contrive to make that inquired Dants	100.18265533447266
With one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither a distance of about fifty feet	179.89215087890625
Fifty feet responded Dants almost terrified	48.004669189453125
Do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	153.53204345703125
It frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners	574.7944946289062
But they believe I am shut up alone here	69.84232330322266
That makes no difference	141.352294921875
And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here	130.28759765625
I do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately I did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet I made it fifty	208.13626098632812
I expected as I told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea I have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it	42.1483268737793
My labor is all in vain for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers	120.83563995361328
That s true said Dants but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation	47.4681396484375
This one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	56.09334182739258
This adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lockup cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured	100.57854461669922
The fourth and last side of your cell faces onfaces onstop a minute now where does it face	123.9857406616211
The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber	132.549560546875
This loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoners escape	142.27757263183594
As the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window	48.9849967956543
Climb up said he to Dants	240.16921997070312
The young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands	115.69418334960938
The stranger whom as yet Dants knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dants and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	22.588905334472656
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying I thought so and sliding from the shoulders of Dants as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground	374.52490234375
What was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table	82.56785583496094
The elder prisoner pondered the matter	91.968994140625
Yes said he at length it is so	261.54144287109375
This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night	216.767578125
Are you quite sure of that	534.2723999023438
I saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for I was fearful he might also see me	38.664180755615234
Well inquired Dants	60.06959533691406
You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon	6.355601787567139
Then pursued the young man eagerly	228.16944885253906
Then answered the elder prisoner the will of God be done And as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	223.75315856933594
Dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration	155.5582733154297
Tell me I entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	65.5944595336914
Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself	342.9535217285156
Willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way	987.0691528320312
Say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind	22.893089294433594
Pray let me know who you really are	154.7559814453125
The stranger smiled a melancholy smile	344.8924560546875
Then listen said he	171.1809539794922
I am the Abb Faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this Chteau dIf since the year 1811 previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle	100.86979675292969
In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in France	88.30960083007812
It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of Rome even in his cradle	33.39847946166992
I was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown	169.0569610595703
Then who reigns in France at this momentNapoleon II	75.4639892578125
No Louis XVIII	32.2288818359375
The brother of Louis XVI	64.09256744384766
How inscrutable are the ways of Providencefor what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased	61.011043548583984
Dants whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others	124.38468170166016
Yes yes continued he Twill be the same as it was in England	43.65962219238281
After Charles I	70.9048080444336
Cromwell after Cromwell Charles II	25.66499900817871
and then James II	34.0133056640625
and then some soninlaw or relation some Prince of Orange a stadtholder who becomes a king	52.528968811035156
Then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty	107.32804107666016
Ah my friend said the abb turning towards Dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass	96.7459716796875
Probably if ever I get out of prison	48.51599884033203
True replied Faria we are prisoners but I forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and I fancy myself at liberty	64.196533203125
But wherefore are you here	133.67889404296875
Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like Machiavelli I desired to alter the political face of Italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler I sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because I fancied I had found my Csar Borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	63.06208801269531
It was the plan of Alexander VI	111.0754165649414
and Clement VII	419.7392578125
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and Napoleon was unable to complete his work	55.5523567199707
Italy seems fated to misfortune	87.13712310791016
And the old man bowed his head	20.834640502929688
Dants could not understand a man risking his life for such matters	80.8908920288086
Napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of Clement VII	77.50040435791016
and Alexander VI	100.91064453125
he knew nothing	75.7242431640625
Are you not he asked the priest who here in the Chteau dIf is generally thought to beill	180.61639404296875
Mad you mean do nt you	82.92059326171875
I did not like to say so answered Dants smiling	29.86623191833496
Well then resumed Faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of the Chteau dIf for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability I should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair	294.35369873046875
Dants remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said	119.93971252441406
Then you abandon all hope of escape	191.59906005859375
I perceive its utter impossibility and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve	369.8659973144531
Nay be not discouraged	72.6454086303711
Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed	41.648067474365234
Alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again	151.79638671875
In the first place I was four years making the tools I possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen	311.7638854980469
Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by nighttime I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hardbound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up I was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery	52.10862731933594
Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when I reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	35.50086975097656
No I repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almightys pleasure	27.220849990844727
Dants held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbs plans	40.34726333618164
The abb sank upon Edmonds bed while Edmond himself remained standing	96.7052001953125
Escape had never once occurred to him	48.03291702270508
There are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	124.09505462646484
To undermine the ground for fifty feetto devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the seato plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shorewere difficulties so startling and formidable that Dants had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death	349.5631408691406
But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	139.29434204101562
Another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation	87.29791259765625
This same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt	102.29507446289062
Another had done all this why then was it impossible to Dants Faria had dug his way through fifty feet Dants would dig a hundred Faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six Faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsDaume Rattonneau or Lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project He could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long At once Dants resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	94.05184936523438
After continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed I have found what you were in search of	212.9020538330078
Faria started Have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered	88.59754943847656
The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not	102.17670440673828
0207 m	67.60491943359375
It does	89.503173828125
And is not above fifteen feet from it	87.9324722290039
About that	212.87139892578125
Well then I will tell you what we must do	120.0473403930664
We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross	16.69305419921875
This time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape	1.0117672681808472
All we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which I am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove mine	127.4796371459961
One instant my dear friend replied the abb it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed and what use I intend making of my strength	251.8663787841797
As for patience I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day	217.5179443359375
But then young man and I pray of you to give me your full attention then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation	73.54205322265625
And have your notions changed asked Dants with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me	98.59236907958984
No neither do I wish to incur guilt	150.44692993164062
Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	62.90081787109375
I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but I can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life	109.88755798339844
A slight movement of surprise escaped Dants	280.8782653808594
Is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it	192.06027221679688
Tell me replied Faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape	90.7256088256836
Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered Dants	65.45722961425781
Because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	61.337425231933594
The tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation	153.8140106201172
Dants was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	28.20676040649414
0209 m	13.974602699279785
Since my imprisonment said Faria I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record	280.4886474609375
They have rarely been successful	72.01177978515625
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Chteau de Vincennes that of the Abb Dubuquoi from For lEvque of Latude from the Bastille	49.91893768310547
Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all	95.60011291503906
Let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it	73.685546875
Ah said Dants you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you	116.94436645507812
I assure you replied the old man I did not turn to that source for recreation or support	230.84164428710938
What did you do then	58.25907516479492
I wrote or studied	9.091707229614258
Were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper	103.90475463867188
Oh no answered the abb I had none but what I made for myself	359.7181091308594
You made paper pens and ink	53.701045989990234
Dants gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing	102.48226165771484
Faria saw this	127.81611633300781
When you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he I will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome at the foot of St	196.28221130371094
Marks column at Venice and on the borders of the Arno at Florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Chteau dIf	657.2141723632812
The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy and will make one large quarto volume	138.5750732421875
And on what have you written all this	108.40208435058594
On two of my shirts	53.94730758666992
I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment	340.3373718261719
You are then a chemist	47.845516204833984
Somewhat I know Lavoisier and was the intimate friend of Cabanis	66.07488250732422
But for such a work you must have needed bookshad you any	155.19100952148438
I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome but after reading them over many times I found out that with one hundred and fifty wellchosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	45.11052703857422
I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till I knew them nearly by heart so that since I have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	54.196041107177734
I could recite you the whole of Thucydides Xenophon Plutarch Titus Livius Tacitus Strada Jornandes Dante Montaigne Shakespeare Spinoza Machiavelli and Bossuet	116.35259246826172
I name only the most important	99.5552978515625
You are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these	272.94012451171875
Yes I speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say German French Italian English and Spanish by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern GreekI do nt speak it so well as I could wish but I am still trying to improve myself	1.012587308883667
Improve yourself repeated Dants why how can you manage to do so	99.90853881835938
Why I made a vocabulary of the words I knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	137.90805053710938
I know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries	55.827491760253906
I can not hope to be very fluent but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as I should ever require	116.75297546386719
Stronger grew the wonder of Dants who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added Then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of	68.66928100585938
I made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	133.86451721191406
You are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days	8.639311790466309
Well I selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday Friday and Saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens for I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief	144.40025329589844
While retracing the past I forget the present and traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner	61.31111145019531
But the ink said Dants of what did you make your ink	290.93572998046875
There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied Faria but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison	129.48239135742188
Still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday and I assure you a better ink can not be desired	1049.2236328125
For very important notes for which closer attention is required I pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood	116.9637680053711
And when asked Dants may I see all this	95.083251953125
Whenever you please replied the abb	196.57293701171875
Oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	107.60311889648438
Follow me then said the abb as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by Dants	51.24909591674805
Chapter 17	81.88414764404297
The Abbs Chamber	39.667564392089844
After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbs cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees	1835.6087646484375
The floor of the abbs cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dants had witnessed the completion	1111.7386474609375
As he entered the chamber of his friend Dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	74.50021362304688
It is well said the abb we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve oclock	94.13825988769531
Instinctively Dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had been able so accurately to specify the hour	50.19742965698242
Look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abb and then observe the lines traced on the wall	18.880775451660156
Well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths	12.410871505737305
This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dants who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	81.81455993652344
A double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible	62.40679168701172
Each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	117.37985229492188
Come said he to the abb I am anxious to see your treasures	94.41944885253906
The abb smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dants	160.33230590820312
0213 m	111.39478302001953
What do you wish to see first asked the abb	120.98783874511719
Oh your great work on the monarchy of Italy	47.4681396484375
Faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus	10.425599098205566
These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that Dants could easily read it as well as make out the senseit being in Italian a language he as a Provenal perfectly understood	54.41202163696289
There said he there is the work complete	62.297855377197266
I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago	61.3881950378418
I have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of to complete the precious pages	327.9466552734375
Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed my literary reputation is forever secured	88.0498275756836
I see answered Dants	103.45559692382812
Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work	96.790771484375
Look said Faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine paintingbrush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abb had before spoken to Dants it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen	41.53009796142578
Dants examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form	96.45904541015625
Ah yes said Faria the penknife	52.52081298828125
That s my masterpiece	65.70634460449219
I made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick	19.534013748168945
The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust	56.12202072143555
Dants examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels	344.34344482421875
As for the ink said Faria I told you how I managed to obtain thatand I only just make it from time to time as I require it	102.97274017333984
One thing still puzzles me observed Dants and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight	112.10011291503906
I worked at night also replied Faria	96.90276336669922
Nightwhy for Heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark	73.96229553222656
Indeed they are not but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions	164.18333435058594
I furnished myself with a light	75.88824462890625
You did Pray tell me how	89.39513397216797
I separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is my lamp	80.28787994384766
So saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations	499.1134338378906
But how do you procure a light	230.37167358398438
Oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen	69.23456573486328
And matches	35.192501068115234
I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied	173.62594604492188
Dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Farias mind	65.8041000366211
0215 m	61.58237075805664
You have not seen all yet continued Faria for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hidingplace	76.05437469482422
Let us shut this one up	11.462233543395996
They put the stone back in its place the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in	51.292884826660156
Behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in length	92.19995880126953
Dants closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight	52.58987045288086
Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work	400.88427734375
I tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at Fenestrelle and when I was removed to the Chteau dIf I managed to bring the ravellings with me so that I have been able to finish my work here	189.4239501953125
And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed	96.38101959228516
Oh no for when I had taken out the thread I required I hemmed the edges over again	34.28255081176758
With what	145.8626708984375
With this needle said the abb as opening his ragged vestments he showed Dants a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it	154.63995361328125
I once thought continued Faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger	118.741455078125
Nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about	127.47509002685547
While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of Dants was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clearsighted as the abb might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing	41.386924743652344
What are you thinking of asked the abb smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder	64.56603240966797
I was reflecting in the first place replied Dants upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained	65.0678939819336
What would you not have accomplished if you had been free	123.6475601196289
Possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect	12.965958595275879
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder	64.43187713623047
Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity lightning from lightning illumination	70.31304168701172
No replied Dants	342.8361511230469
I know nothing	93.53536987304688
Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	619.4518432617188
You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have	56.28359603881836
The abb smiled	142.97036743164062
Well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now	174.70741271972656
I did	57.2004508972168
You have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other	85.47676086425781
It was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine	81.68603515625
Your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events	70.04533386230469
It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune	171.22805786132812
I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon Heaven	44.96687316894531
Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged	73.46444702148438
I do indeed and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and Mercds	126.88683319091797
Come said the abb closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story	147.17404174804688
Dants obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to India and two or three voyages to the Levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of Captain Leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtierhis arrival at Marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for Mercds and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the Palais de Justice and his final imprisonment in the Chteau dIf	98.62194061279297
From this point everything was a blank to Dantshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	229.22866821289062
His recital finished the abb reflected long and earnestly	145.4888916015625
There is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	175.6849822998047
Still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness	160.6427001953125
From this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous	1.0096341371536255
Now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable	80.09711456298828
To no one by Heaven I was a very insignificant person	194.7244415283203
Do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place	120.74797058105469
Now in the event of the kings death his successor inherits a crownwhen the employee dies the supernumerary steps into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres	60.88215637207031
Well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king	67.7900161743164
Everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in Descartes theory of pressure and impulsion	57.458396911621094
But these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base	55.29671096801758
Now let us return to your particular world	67.79900360107422
You say you were on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon	115.77613830566406
And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl	110.492431640625
Now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the Pharaon	203.62905883789062
What say you	81.14830780029297
I can not believe such was the case	122.50942993164062
I was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	219.98626708984375
There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards me	92.92334747314453
I had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused	249.28163146972656
Now we are getting on	33.946922302246094
And what was this mans name	56.48632049560547
What rank did he hold on board	75.41129302978516
He was supercargo	35.90049743652344
And had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment	57.0142707824707
Not if the choice had remained with me for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts	290.6606140136719
Good again Now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere	84.6065444946289
No we were quite alone	100.85801696777344
Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone	353.56195068359375
It might for the cabin door was openandstay now I recollectDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal	129.66726684570312
That s better cried the abb now we are on the right scent	89.98052215576172
Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba	88.12467956542969
Somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it I think	37.195899963378906
Yes the grand marshal did	379.9262390136719
And what did you do with that letter	200.6539764404297
Put it into my portfolio	152.91415405273438
You had your portfolio with you then Now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter	345.0298156738281
You are right it was left on board	21.742345809936523
Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio	948.3303833007812
And what did you do with this same letter while returning from PortoFerrajo to the vessel	242.97268676757812
I carried it in my hand	74.26594543457031
So that when you went on board the Pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand	214.6339874267578
Danglars as well as the rest	73.86104583740234
Danglars as well as others	30.229787826538086
Now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest	8.162075996398926
Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated	145.89389038085938
Oh yes I read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory	482.64239501953125
Repeat it to me	64.1396484375
Dants paused a moment then said This is it word for word The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants mate on board the Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris	62.62553787231445
This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the Pharaon	296.61041259765625
The abb shrugged his shoulders	161.4603271484375
The thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair	149.72467041015625
Do you really think so Ah that would indeed be infamous	95.27722930908203
How did Danglars usually write	124.8931884765625
In a handsome running hand	118.86851501464844
And how was the anonymous letter written	148.47467041015625
Again the abb smiled	36.24257278442383
It was very boldly written if disguised	887.6090087890625
Stop a bit said the abb taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation	334.3869323730469
Dants drew back and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror	63.111541748046875
How very astonishing cried he at length	418.5072021484375
Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation	54.77262496948242
Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and I have noticed that	54.996986389160156
That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform	223.141357421875
You have evidently seen and observed everything	69.75128936767578
Let us proceed	147.10324096679688
Oh yes yes	72.81600189208984
Now as regards the second question	72.0746841430664
I am listening	88.62107849121094
Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercds	111.29081726074219
Yes a young man who loved her	125.60844421386719
And his name was	125.15633392333984
That is a Spanish name I think	47.526451110839844
He was a Catalan	233.8539276123047
You imagine him capable of writing the letter	21.742345809936523
Oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me	460.6929931640625
That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never	342.9105224609375
Besides said Dants the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him	100.9039077758789
You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone	74.65824890136719
To no one	96.69874572753906
Not even to your mistress	163.52413940429688
No not even to my betrothed	363.5280456542969
Then it is Danglars	258.20416259765625
I feel quite sure of it now	625.9114990234375
Wait a little	142.0382080078125
Pray was Danglars acquainted with Fernand	4830.88623046875
Noyes he was	85.36715698242188
Now I recollect	878.663818359375
To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Pre Pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my wedding	90.91880798339844
They were in earnest conversation	60.38397216796875
Danglars was joking in a friendly way but Fernand looked pale and agitated	122.59989166259766
Were they alone	173.24337768554688
There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named Caderousse but he was very drunk	53.1403694152832
StaystayHow strange that it should not have occurred to me before Now I remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	76.9218978881836
Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed Dants pressing his hand to his throbbing brows	137.42916870117188
Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abb with a laugh	129.52383422851562
Yes yes replied Dants eagerly I would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that I underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me	274.6354675292969
That is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb	40.189640045166016
The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated	70.71400451660156
All we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play	83.2230224609375
If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point	43.124332427978516
Pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do myself	43.2448616027832
In the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate	131.88211059570312
The deputy	50.856964111328125
Was he young or old	51.6297721862793
About six or sevenandtwenty years of age I should say	50.89989471435547
So answered the abb	124.66179656982422
Old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt	1.0130820274353027
And how did he treat you	233.8539276123047
With more of mildness than severity	73.33467102050781
Did you tell him your whole story	460.6929931640625
I did	156.99948120117188
And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination	51.95853042602539
He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	53.364383697509766
He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune	105.87095642089844
By your misfortune	153.4388885498047
Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored	76.8926010131836
He gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate	111.54844665527344
And that	106.13592529296875
He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me	4830.88623046875
What the accusation	98.93280792236328
No the letter	232.02664184570312
Are you sure	45.05420684814453
I saw it done	90.91880798339844
That alters the case	50.856964111328125
This man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible	79.56307983398438
Upon my word said Dants you make me shudder	134.7840118408203
Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles	133.79144287109375
Yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others	141.22940063476562
Never mind let us go on	69.82024383544922
With all my heart You tell me he burned the letter	104.62345123291016
He did saying at the same time You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you	70.73299407958984
This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural	89.75606536865234
You think so	214.67666625976562
I am sure of it	210.00889587402344
To whom was this letter addressed	154.2597198486328
To M	91.68862915039062
Noirtier Rue CoqHron No	48.71038055419922
13 Paris	243.89468383789062
Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter	52.704891204833984
Why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address	419.490966796875
Noirtier repeated the abb NoirtierI knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruriaa Noirtier who had been a Girondin during the Revolution What was your deputy called	187.86624145507812
De Villefort The abb burst into a fit of laughter while Dants gazed on him in utter astonishment	25.532636642456055
What ails you said he at length	95.48735046386719
Do you see that ray of sunlight	232.3512725830078
I do	117.09535217285156
Well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	112.69361877441406
Poor fellow poor young man And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you	51.185585021972656
He did	38.12125778198242
And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter	44.008792877197266
And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier	31.324342727661133
Why you poor shortsighted simpleton can you not guess who this Noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed This Noirtier was his father	120.97734832763672
Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dants or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words	48.432395935058594
Starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed His father his father	103.73944854736328
Yes his father replied the abb his right name was Noirtier de Villefort	2480.57470703125
At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dants and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before	254.24652099609375
The change that had come over Villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his memory	96.31270599365234
He cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbs cell to his own and said I must be alone to think over all this	42.91116714477539
When he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	222.85073852539062
During these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath	127.71479797363281
Dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his supper	61.1945686340332
The reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abb unusual privileges	71.3343734741211
He was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine	57.35599136352539
Now this was a Sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	228.32867431640625
Dants followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve	169.7039031982422
Faria bent on him his penetrating eye	39.385284423828125
I regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information I did	270.1280517578125
Why so inquired Dants	24.441438674926758
Because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance	77.24358367919922
Dants smiled	143.40475463867188
Let us talk of something else said he	77.14836120605469
Again the abb looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with Dants request he began to speak of other matters	50.3516845703125
The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows	107.72032928466797
Dants listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire	124.41737365722656
A part of the good abbs words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home	134.821044921875
You must teach me a small part of what you know said Dants if only to prevent your growing weary of me	219.61892700195312
I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself	347.8976135253906
If you will only agree to my request I promise you never to mention another word about escaping	103.59510040283203
The abb smiled	169.0599365234375
Alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when I have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted you will know as much as I do myself	203.00160217285156
Now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess	255.31137084960938
Two years exclaimed Dants do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time	306.2595520019531
Not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned	131.2621307373047
Memory makes the one philosophy the other	183.3069610595703
But can not one learn philosophy	128.5167999267578
Philosophy can not be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into heaven	188.5218505859375
Well then said Dants What shall you teach me first I am in a hurry to begin	288.7550964355469
I want to learn	36.08719253540039
Everything said the abb	307.43841552734375
And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day	55.871620178222656
Dants possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry	163.33554077148438
He already knew Italian and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish English and German	43.6431770324707
In strict accordance with the promise made to the abb Dants spoke no more of escape	285.6605529785156
Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight	47.568153381347656
Days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course	45.063323974609375
At the end of a year Dants was a new man	93.90409088134766
Dants observed however that Faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind	289.4432067871094
Sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon	28.450702667236328
One day he stopped all at once and exclaimed	60.84955978393555
Ah if there were no sentinel	118.73001861572266
There shall not be one a minute longer than you please said Dants who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	57.47675704956055
I have already told you answered the abb that I loathe the idea of shedding blood	70.45571899414062
And yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpreservation	180.0189971923828
No matter I could never agree to it	87.06950378417969
Still you have thought of it	101.52775573730469
Incessantly alas cried the abb	119.72606658935547
And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked Dants eagerly	182.78805541992188
I have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us	120.86709594726562
He shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	231.46826171875
No no cried the abb impossible	87.5499496459961
Dants endeavored to renew the subject the abb shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response	56.84542465209961
Three months passed away	26.59438133239746
Are you strong the abb asked one day of Dants	147.93545532226562
The young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it	484.620361328125
And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort	205.28819274902344
I promise on my honor	322.1579895019531
Then said the abb we may hope to put our design into execution	143.9409637451172
And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work	131.1814727783203
At least a year	390.2073059082031
And shall we begin at once	110.1250228881836
At once	22.110353469848633
We have lost a year to no purpose cried Dants	68.6114501953125
Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	97.51438903808594
Forgive me cried Edmond blushing deeply	64.2038803100586
Tut tut answered the abb man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known	197.33956909179688
Come let me show you my plan	117.0570068359375
The abb then showed Dants the sketch he had made for their escape	501.9720458984375
It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dants with the passage which united them	58.65027618408203
In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flagstones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by Dants before he had power to offer any resistance	46.15283203125
The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbs ladder of cords	241.1353302001953
Dants eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed	94.78226470947266
That very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success	50.355682373046875
Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits	33.900917053222656
They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	53.24026107788086
The fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either Farias or Dants cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain	33.11946105957031
More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever Faria still continuing to instruct Dants by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory	170.92898559570312
The abb was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dants thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding	88.18196868896484
At the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads	20.010404586791992
Compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way	122.38868713378906
Dants was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria who had remained in Edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering	319.9713439941406
Dants hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together	114.03544616699219
Gracious heavens exclaimed Dants what is the matter what has happened	1248.5240478515625
Quick quick returned the abb listen to what I have to say	189.6869659423828
Dants looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end	257.01593017578125
Tell me I beseech you what ails you cried Dants letting his chisel fall to the floor	121.37899017333984
Alas faltered out the abb all is over with me	125.89566802978516
I am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching	156.38978576660156
I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment	69.41191101074219
This malady admits but of one remedy I will tell you what that is	98.99207305908203
Go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a redlooking fluid	33.666107177734375
Bring it to meor ratherno noI may be found here therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along	1.0272831916809082
Who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last	230.65646362304688
In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes Dants did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then halfcarrying halfsupporting him he managed to reach the abbs chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed	41.154815673828125
Thanks said the poor abb shivering as though his veins were filled with ice	86.47003173828125
I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan	112.61266326904297
On the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly	336.765380859375
Take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever	340.85302734375
When I become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and I may perhaps revive	210.63409423828125
Perhaps exclaimed Dants in griefstricken tones	46.60271453857422
Help help cried the abb IIdieI	84.79847717285156
0229 m	161.22154235839844
So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however Dants prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket	29.487598419189453
The fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse	61.228546142578125
Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result	104.7488021850586
An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation	153.63494873046875
Dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend	140.61770629882812
At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move	71.83875274658203
He is saved he is saved cried Dants in a paroxysm of delight	410.0318603515625
The sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door	168.55917358398438
Dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	443.5396423339844
It was therefore near seven oclock but Edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	129.50177001953125
The young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell	93.21065521240234
He had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed	1.0358502864837646
Almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse Dants whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbs chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick mans couch	124.89979553222656
Faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed	83.36318969726562
I did not expect to see you again said he feebly to Dants	99.83267211914062
And why not asked the young man	98.7364273071289
Did you fancy yourself dying	153.7310791015625
No I had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your escape	422.67425537109375
The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dants	29.50334358215332
Without you Did you really think me capable of that	105.09701538085938
At least said the abb I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been	48.97865676879883
Alas alas I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack	1811.7266845703125
Be of good cheer replied Dants your strength will return	61.26943588256836
And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria and took his hands	205.25460815429688
The abb shook his head	51.72216033935547
The last attack I had said he lasted but half an hour and after it I was hungry and got up without help now I can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain	144.44081115722656
The third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life	67.46062469482422
No no cried Dants you are mistakenyou will not die And your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty	113.55804443359375
We shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance	43.0463981628418
My good Edmond answered the abb be not deceived	36.62034225463867
The attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison	46.15767288208008
None can fly from a dungeon who can not walk	155.060546875
Well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength will return	79.80777740478516
Everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose	178.15650939941406
As soon as you feel able to swim we will go	292.1744384765625
I shall never swim again replied Faria	164.30752563476562
This arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever	33.3729133605957
Lift it and judge if I am mistaken	36.83655548095703
The young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless	118.54000091552734
A sigh escaped him	110.705810546875
You are convinced now Edmond are you not asked the abb	76.24762725830078
Depend upon it I know what I say	1.0176271200180054
Since the first attack I experienced of this malady I have continually reflected on it	51.05804443359375
Indeed I expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack	124.88639831542969
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated Cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me	73.73538208007812
0233 m	49.53533935546875
The physician may be mistaken exclaimed Dants	134.9736328125
And as for your poor arm what difference will that make I can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us	146.76239013671875
My son said the abb you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes	37.96832275390625
Cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in	122.72915649414062
Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death	191.8295135498047
As for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoI give you back your promise	144.30361938476562
It is well said Dants	336.7586364746094
Then I shall also remain	209.67738342285156
Then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live	39.51011657714844
Faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose	177.65455627441406
Thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand	25.316926956176758
I accept	95.53790283203125
You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	90.08600616455078
But as I can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance	47.073978424072266
That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated	118.16566467285156
Go then and set about this work in which unhappily I can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me	142.49647521972656
I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you	234.81309509277344
Dants took the hand of the abb in his and affectionately pressed it	82.6146469116211
Faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend	113.4287109375
Chapter 18	320.1019592285156
The Treasure	279.4648132324219
When Dants returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found Faria seated and looking composed	65.56181335449219
In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open	124.56832885742188
He did not speak but showed the paper to Dants	87.52703094482422
What is that he inquired	47.30708694458008
Look at it said the abb with a smile	105.06539916992188
I have looked at it with all possible attention said Dants and I only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink	489.4380187988281
This paper my friend said Faria I may now avow to you since I have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to you	42.74165344238281
The sweat started forth on Dants brow	119.75507354736328
Until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abb the accusation of madness	63.997650146484375
With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and Faria had been equally silent	89.83779907226562
He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by Faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation	163.63223266601562
Your treasure stammered Dants	146.53916931152344
Faria smiled	125.97157287597656
Yes said he	253.80221557617188
You have indeed a noble nature Edmond and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment	93.81645965576172
No be assured I am not mad	97.63684844970703
This treasure exists Dants and if I have not been allowed to possess it you will	89.07489776611328
No one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that I am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will	210.54000854492188
Alas murmured Edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse There was only this blow wanting	235.10874938964844
Then he said aloud My dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile Tomorrow if you will I will hear your narrative but today I wish to nurse you carefully	82.51071166992188
Besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about	71.35808563232422
On the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance Edmond replied the old man	62.40756607055664
Who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on and then must not all be over Yes indeed I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me	123.16862487792969
This idea was one of vengeance to me and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	65.26210021972656
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you now that I see you young and with a promising futurenow that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure I shudder at any delay and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth	438.79217529296875
Edmond turned away his head with a sigh	173.31202697753906
You persist in your incredulity Edmond continued Faria	56.892333984375
My words have not convinced you	178.02005004882812
I see you require proofs	87.7499771118164
Well then read this paper which I have never shown to anyone	131.71092224121094
Tomorrow my dear friend said Edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	143.97418212890625
I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow	1.010878562927246
Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today	91.4968490600586
I will not irritate him thought Edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read	37.770042419433594
this treasure which may amount to two	142.36361694335938
of Roman crowns in the most distant a	88.01628875732422
of the second opening wh	237.26661682128906
declare to belong to him alo	196.58184814453125
25th April 149	1120.9476318359375
Well said Faria when the young man had finished reading it	105.59300994873047
Why replied Dants I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire	92.2940444946289
Yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought	34.57756423950195
And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning	71.22666931152344
I am sure I have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper	15.583069801330566
Silence exclaimed Dants	82.40486145019531
Steps approachI goadieu	125.90617370605469
And Dants happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friends mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while Faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery	99.91873168945312
It was the governor who hearing of Farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see him	109.61093139648438
Faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death	104.80306243896484
His fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion	220.29354858398438
But fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition	151.65176391601562
During this time Edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts	43.25232696533203
Faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness	48.04243087768555
Was Faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to Faria	110.85858154296875
Dants remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abb was madsuch a conviction would be so terrible	142.5914764404297
But towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by Faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them	291.6653747558594
Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm	43.64506912231445
Edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dants chamber	100.10395812988281
Here I am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile	194.32791137695312
You thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain	138.34703063964844
Listen to me	66.84371948242188
Edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	169.4735870361328
You know said the abb that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada the last of the princes of that name	116.8609619140625
I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew	123.99562072753906
He was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and I heard the phrase very often As rich as a Spada	67.50631713867188
But he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise	390.0958557128906
I was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world I tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness	118.60428619384766
The cardinals house had no secrets for me	19752.306640625
I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts	68.22774505615234
One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the History of the City of Rome	137.02999877929688
There in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI	142.91217041015625
were the following lines which I can never forget	75.62782287597656
The great wars of Romagna had ended Csar Borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all Italy	65.9330062866211
The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII	137.68983459472656
King of France who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy	49.15044021606445
His holiness had an idea	143.40037536621094
He determined to make two cardinals	98.89012908935547
By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome especially rich menthis was the return the Holy Father looked for	85.64252471923828
In the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides	97.46380615234375
There was a third point in view which will appear hereafter	136.1804656982422
The pope and Csar Borgia first found the two future cardinals they were Giovanni Rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See and Csar Spada one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope	65.30353546142578
They were ambitious and Csar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	102.02422332763672
The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators	141.5702362060547
0239 m	81.00796508789062
It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation	132.77464294433594
The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome	171.8871612548828
Then the pope and Csar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	51.32896041870117
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son	164.07962036132812
Csar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard	131.9484100341797
This key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locksmith	78.15325164794922
When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	42.522552490234375
Then there was the ring with the lions head which Csar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand	1.0070018768310547
The lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was mortal	980.2217407226562
Csar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but Alexander VI	22.783588409423828
replied Now as to the worthy cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back	249.4597625732422
Besides you forget Csar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two	125.43265533447266
Csar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner	126.6332778930664
The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near San Pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	234.59205627441406
Rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	66.88015747070312
Spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will	179.19757080078125
He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him	118.92340087890625
Spada knew what these invitations meant since Christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in Rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message Csar wills that you die	160.2611541748047
but it was a legate   latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope His holiness requests you to dine with him	145.60360717773438
Spada set out about two oclock to San Pierdarena	63.58745193481445
The pope awaited him	55.56316375732422
The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew in full costume and Csar Borgia paying him most marked attentions	308.4451599121094
Spada turned pale as Csar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread	95.62345123291016
They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message	135.2272491455078
The nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question	59.21869659423828
It was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	30.425891876220703
Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste	28.58999252319336
An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms	56.97578430175781
Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend	35.98165512084961
Then Csar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man	100.47840881347656
But the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which Spada had writtenI bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle	80.83744812011719
The heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that Spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories	132.08689880371094
That was all	164.1722869873047
Csar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired Look well among my uncles papers there is a will	492.6049499511719
They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless	80.14005279541016
There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son	234.92486572265625
Months and years rolled on	122.49925994873047
Alexander VI	113.84822082519531
died poisonedyou know by what mistake	132.62530517578125
Csar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tigers	61.41996383666992
Then compelled to quit Rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history	123.94241333007812
After the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the case	106.54350280761719
The Spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that Csar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals	143.658935546875
I say the two because Cardinal Rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled	69.34534454345703
Up to this point said Faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh	75.65505981445312
Oh my friend cried Dants on the contrary it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative go on I beg of you	51.096622467041016
I will	49.43524169921875
The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity	210.00437927246094
Years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined	8.99348258972168
I come now to the last of the family whose secretary I wasthe Count of Spada	197.19422912597656
I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity	99.45438385009766
He did so and thus doubled his income	20.319900512695312
The celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts possession	253.22389221191406
It had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	41.72412872314453
It was an illuminated book with beautiful Gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	73.17999267578125
At the sight of papers of all sortstitles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches I foundnothing	236.97354125976562
Yet I had read I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Csar Spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi his companion in misfortune	82.63726043701172
I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie	43.085201263427734
I searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years	40.93827819824219
It was useless	55.51258087158203
I remained in my ignorance and the Count of Spada in his poverty	62.173423767089844
My patron died	40.64420700073242
He had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary	40.35489273071289
All these he bequeathed to me with a thousand Roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house	144.48753356933594
All this I did scrupulously	135.4873046875
Be easy my dear Edmond we are near the conclusion	190.41522216796875
In 1807 a month before I was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada on the 25th of December you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory I was reading for the thousandth time the papers I was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten my head dropped on my hands and I fell asleep about three oclock in the afternoon	307.3556213378906
0243 m	505.18975830078125
I awoke as the clock was striking six	56.36408615112305
I raised my head I was in utter darkness	260.70965576171875
I rang for a light but as no one came I determined to find one for myself	320.62408447265625
It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting	243.7987518310547
I took a waxcandle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my matchbox being empty with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers	103.28430938720703
Fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper I hesitated for a moment then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	80.59093475341797
I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it	170.9566192626953
But beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	92.94599914550781
I grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as I could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when I had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly onethird of the paper had been consumed by the flame	105.92478942871094
It was that paper you read this morning read it again Dants and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense	156.2136688232422
Faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to Dants who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust	22.82088851928711
This 25th day of April 1498 be	304.0950927734375

25th April 1498	90.96463775634766
And now said the abb read this other paper and he presented to Dants a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which Edmond read as follows	87.15055084228516

Faria followed him with an excited look	35.201820373535156
And now he said when he saw that Dants had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself	117.10987854003906
Dants obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following	107.10549926757812

25th April 1498	138.88400268554688
ar   Spada	104.04952239990234
Well do you comprehend now inquired Faria	151.38040161132812
It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada and the will so long sought for replied Edmond still incredulous	31.54146385192871
Yes a thousand times yes	174.1520538330078
And who completed it as it now is	118.14955139160156
I did	32.42064666748047
Aided by the remaining fragment I guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us	203.40341186523438
And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion	50.265071868896484
I resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the Italian kingdom but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino	63.161033630371094
Now continued Faria addressing Dants with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as I do myself	313.1671142578125
If we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if I die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you	62.21357727050781
But inquired Dants hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves	110.49290466308594
No no be easy on that score the family is extinct	33.30229187011719
The last Count of Spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point	208.68333435058594
If we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse	93.70978546142578
And you say this treasure amounts to	79.0948257446289
Two millions of Roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money	7.627424716949463
Impossible said Dants staggered at the enormous amount	53.62286376953125
Impossible and why asked the old man	97.91607666015625
The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they can not touch	146.0735626220703
Edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy	172.04689025878906
I have only kept this secret so long from you continued Faria that I might test your character and then surprise you	157.1378936767578
Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	30.72892951965332
Well Dants you do not thank me	108.23953247070312
This treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied Dants and to you only	11.724130630493164
I have no right to it	15.245038986206055
I am no relation of yours	403.0709533691406
You are my son Dants exclaimed the old man	65.01274871826172
You are the child of my captivity	121.64615631103516
My profession condemns me to celibacy	22.26076316833496
God has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free	110.21448516845703
And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept	97.08568572998047
Chapter 19	373.3462829589844
The Third Attack	25.86334991455078
Now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbs meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to Dants all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then Dants countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies	2149.523193359375
The abb did not know the Island of Monte Cristo but Dants knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from Pianosa between Corsica and the Island of Elba and had once touched there	150.1061248779297
This island was always had been and still is completely deserted	15.115179061889648
It is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	117.42642211914062
Dants drew a plan of the island for Faria and Faria gave Dants advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure	108.66975402832031
But Dants was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	57.733009338378906
It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased Edmonds admiration of him but at the same time Dants could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there	32.02964401245117
However as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt	55.25851821899414
They had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dants had partly filled in	54.144535064697266
But for this precaution which it will be remembered the abb had made to Edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	70.16658020019531
Thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes	38.82197952270508
You see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to Faria that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	97.15862274169922
I have promised to remain forever with you and now I could not break my promise if I would	38.606666564941406
The treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison	70.8397216796875
But my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications	46.84782409667969
These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy	59.84624481201172
Believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	225.2273712158203
To have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speechwhich embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if I should ever be freeso fills my whole existence that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical but actual	42.16490173339844
I owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even Csar Borgia himself could not deprive me of this	117.14668273925781
Thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly	130.44760131835938
Faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it	84.51836395263672
As he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself	128.302978515625
But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy	185.120849609375
For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled Dants to learn it by heart and Dants knew it from the first to the last word	36.28782653808594
Then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning	109.91046142578125
Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty	41.10710525512695
Then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain Monte Cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spotthe appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening	71.98919677734375
In the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	25.544208526611328
Faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	128.11387634277344
They were thus perpetually employedFaria that he might not see himself grow old Dants for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	53.08819580078125
So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence	1.0132534503936768
But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his cell	70.55133056640625
One night Edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him	46.655067443847656
He opened his eyes upon utter darkness	1.0356078147888184
His name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	389.419921875
He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	113.62385559082031
Undoubtedly the call came from Farias dungeon	44.673980712890625
Alas murmured Edmond can it be	53.86735153198242
He moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open	218.49197387695312
By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken Dants saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	189.96095275878906
His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time	23.41478157043457
Alas my dear friend said Faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and I need not attempt to explain to you	45.969383239746094
Edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming Help help	127.1014404296875
Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him	54.60820007324219
Silence he said or you are lost	575.2737426757812
We must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible	224.53262329101562
It would require years to do again what I have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other	73.22624206542969
Besides be assured my dear Edmond the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation	38.56587600708008
Perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while I have been but a hindrance	45.23237609863281
You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements	134.28338623046875
At length Providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time I should die	58.350379943847656
Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim Oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said Oh I have saved you once and I will save you a second time And raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	239.6473388671875
See he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught	733.3138427734375
Quick quick tell me what I must do this time are there any fresh instructions Speak my friend I listen	73.02320098876953
There is not a hope replied Faria shaking his head but no matter God wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear	41.38351058959961
Oh yes yes exclaimed Dants and I tell you that I will save you yet	66.73638916015625
Well then try	44.878360748291016
The cold gains upon me	120.80142211914062
I feel the blood flowing towards my brain	83.33302307128906
These horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse	107.15918731689453
Oh exclaimed Dants his heart wrung with anguish	116.310546875
Do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do	96.94190216064453
If after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that I do not recover then pour the rest down my throat	22.352806091308594
Now lift me on my bed for I can no longer support myself	73.72462463378906
Edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed	95.68096923828125
And now my dear friend said Faria sole consolation of my wretched existenceyou whom Heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which I am most gratefulat the moment of separating from you forever I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve	114.49378204345703
My son I bless thee	432.40435791015625
The young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed	66.59493255615234
Listen now to what I say in this my dying moment	338.14324951171875
The treasure of the Spadas exists	101.25686645507812
God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space	122.6529312133789
I see it in the depths of the inner cavern	186.2289581298828
My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches	58.9329719543457
If you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so	58.4658203125
Hasten to Monte Cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long enough	179.88177490234375
A violent convulsion attacked the old man	254.03443908691406
Dants raised his head and saw Farias eyes injected with blood	152.90496826171875
It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	1.0114516019821167
Adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping Edmonds hand convulsivelyadieu	67.4923095703125
Oh nono not yet he cried do not forsake me Oh succor him Helphelphelp	282.8712463378906
Hush hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me	117.47027587890625
You are right	73.80380249023438
Oh yes yes be assured I shall save you Besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before	110.23457336425781
Do not mistake I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure	105.85687255859375
At your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly	79.85342407226562
Oh tis heretis heretis overmy sight is gonemy senses fail Your hand Dants Adieu adieu	103.90098571777344
And raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he saidMonte Cristo forget not Monte Cristo And he fell back on the bed	128.6822967529297
The crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there	54.756797790527344
Dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body	171.98562622070312
With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	90.6270751953125
When he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	35.94609069824219
He waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took place	171.7153778076172
Trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart	8.496661186218262
Then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	65.78923034667969
0255 m	88.2821044921875
The draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open	190.11428833007812
Half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish Edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	67.18310546875
It was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp	143.3423309326172
Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life	1.0165334939956665
While the struggle between day and night lasted Dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	38.64680862426758
Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as shut	107.10626983642578
He extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended	89.4193115234375
It was time for the jailer was coming	246.60121154785156
On this occasion he began his rounds at Dants cell and on leaving him he went on to Farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen	201.18865966796875
Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred	33.6043586730957
He went on his way	104.61257934570312
Dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend	153.64907836914062
He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help	74.13761138916016
Other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers	50.30271911621094
Last of all came the governor	117.86746978759766
Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor	98.53530883789062
The governor then went out and words of pity fell on Dants listening ears mingled with brutal laughter	121.81094360351562
Well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	158.72967529296875
Good journey to him	439.7817077636719
With all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	99.94832611083984
Oh added a third voice the shrouds of the Chteau dIf are not dear	323.868408203125
0257 m	119.92375946044922
Perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf	53.50199508666992
They may give him the honors of the sack	114.11921691894531
Edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said	98.20022583007812
The voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell	101.56954193115234
Still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead	129.0306854248047
He remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	191.78553771972656
At the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased	106.1976318359375
It was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	81.9126968383789
There was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	170.7071990966797
The inquiries soon commenced	34.03883361816406
The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	83.58612823486328
Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dants indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect equal to his own	126.20978546142578
I am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching	128.9381866455078
Ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years Ill answer for it without any attempt to escape	76.04110717773438
Still said the governor I believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that I doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead	81.71615600585938
There was a moment of complete silence during which Dants still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time	108.24279022216797
You may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	219.91465759277344
I will answer for that	127.94136047363281
You know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination	220.17791748046875
In spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law	85.09205627441406
Let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution	69.71541595458984
This order to heat the irons made Dants shudder	147.55038452148438
He heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying	205.3052215576172
Here is the brazier lighted	43.455650329589844
There was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dants was listening in horror	39.9936408996582
The perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	81.3950424194336
You see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive	422.9486389160156
The poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity	162.18087768554688
Was nt his name Faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	1.0026410818099976
0259 m	2164.02099609375
Yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name	15.960780143737793
He was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intractable	121.52388000488281
It is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor	71.61216735839844
You had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb	166.30657958984375
Never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories	108.8388671875
One day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her	458.6304931640625
Ah ah said the doctor I did not know that I had a rival but I hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence	483.4183654785156
Yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find	135.70460510253906
Will that satisfy you	183.87774658203125
Must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	198.1793975830078
But make hasteI can not stay here all day	184.51646423339844
Other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dants ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	122.95590209960938
This evening said the governor	90.22882080078125
Will there be any mass asked one of the attendants	57.08570861816406
That is impossible replied the governor	76.2430419921875
The chaplain of the chteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to Hyres for a week	88.0138168334961
I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence	218.13584899902344
If the poor abb had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem	94.54483032226562
Pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman	1174.171875
God will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest	397.5093688964844
A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	67.24422454833984
Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on	175.93296813964844
This evening said the governor when the task was ended	134.4592742919922
At what hour inquired a turnkey	73.9718246459961
Why about ten or eleven oclock	138.3897247314453
Shall we watch by the corpse	54.91046142578125
Of what use would it be Shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all	179.52163696289062
Then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensuedthe silence of death which was allpervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dants	137.86654663085938
Then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	63.1744384765625
It was empty and Dants emerged from the tunnel	52.88806915283203
Chapter 20	152.1279754638672
The Cemetery of the Chteau dIf	292.7223205566406
On the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was Farias last windingsheeta windingsheet which as the turnkey said cost so little	63.996829986572266
Everything was in readiness	43.759620666503906
A barrier had been placed between Dants and his old friend	69.03199005126953
No longer could Edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	55.06815719604492
Faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed	53.535064697265625
He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie	33.143394470214844
Alone he was alone again again condemned to silenceagain face to face with nothingness Alonenever again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth Was not Farias fate the better after allto solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering	39.6414909362793
The idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbs dead body	177.8160858154297
If I could die he said I should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again	63.75106430053711
But how to die It is very easy he went on with a smile I will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me	242.62374877929688
But excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave	65.11492156982422
Dants recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty	17176.1640625
Die oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much Die yes had I died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny	42.62114715576172
No I want to live I shall struggle to the very last I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been deprived	23.698606491088867
Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward	45.33241271972656
Yet they will forget me here and I shall die in my dungeon like Faria	45.92942810058594
As he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought	71.5445556640625
Suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed	267.70196533203125
Just God he muttered whence comes this thought Is it from thee Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead	205.8410186767578
Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which Faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	71.58563995361328
He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment	754.7457885742188
Dants might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	214.79421997070312
In that case his last hope would have been destroyed	84.14900207519531
Now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	273.3399658203125
If while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body Dants did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	133.63064575195312
0263 m	156.6463623046875
If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	93.12389373779297
He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it	93.17261505126953
If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be over	213.48028564453125
Dants had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now	62.76210021972656
His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one	32.64829635620117
The first risk that Dants ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oclock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue Dants had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word	120.65335083007812
This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to Dants and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	129.34959411621094
When seven oclock came Dants agony really began	201.73538208007812
His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples	18.87204933166504
From time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice	84.84992218017578
Then he thought he was going to die	138.06471252441406
Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and Dants knew that he had escaped the first peril	141.65924072265625
It was a good augury	150.78634643554688
At length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs	184.5264892578125
Edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins	456.0126037597656
The footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand Dants guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handbier	357.1627197265625
The door opened and a dim light reached Dants eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand	231.61962890625
The two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities	182.07778930664062
He s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head	386.6802978515625
They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet	69.87586975097656
Have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	128.6100311279297
What would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply I can do that when we get there	1294.689453125
Yes you re right replied the companion	1.0062146186828613
What s the knot for thought Dants	66.02799224853516
They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier	147.57318115234375
Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	106.44976043701172
Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and Dants knew that the mistral was blowing	167.72958374023438
It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled	68.40756225585938
The bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground	380.2234802246094
One of them went away and Dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement	423.55511474609375
Where am I he asked himself	167.44566345214844
Really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbarrow	202.63235473632812
Dants first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it	94.10279846191406
Give us a light said the other bearer or I shall never find what I am looking for	142.3383026123047
The man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms	79.55606842041016
What can he be looking for thought Edmond	94.58785247802734
The spade perhaps	57.61845779418945
An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his search	88.22958374023438
Here it is at last he said not without some trouble though	272.810546875
Yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting	122.33173370361328
As he said this the man came towards Edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence	44.35188674926758
Well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking on	60.51668167114258
Yes and pretty tight too I can tell you was the answer	438.6446533203125
Move on then	70.13436126708984
And the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded	100.0400619506836
They advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again	53.35270309448242
The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chteau is built reached Dants ear distinctly as they went forward	38.858009338378906
Bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea	71.83275604248047
Why yes the abb runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter	169.324951171875
Dants did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head	81.04440307617188
Well here we are at last said one of them	66.32217407226562
A little farthera little farther said the other	244.50111389160156
You know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows	32.52467727661133
They ascended five or six more steps and then Dants felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro	213.3243865966797
One said the gravediggers two three	44.89344024658203
And at the same instant Dants felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	155.22943115234375
Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century	94.36882019042969
At last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves	364.006591796875
Dants had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysixpound shot tied to his feet	38.34029006958008
The sea is the cemetery of the Chteau dIf	35.5642204284668
0267 m	78.96172332763672
Chapter 21	141.3775634765625
The Island of Tiboulen	35.330474853515625
Dants although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower	111.97718811035156
He then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled	114.5730209350586
With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud	85.47138214111328
Dants waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	27.752485275268555
When he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk	101.33869171142578
He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm	38.3439826965332
Behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures	94.65765380859375
He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his cry	29.29935073852539
Dants dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	57.62104415893555
This was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port	100.14836120605469
When he came up again the light had disappeared	76.98794555664062
He must now get his bearings	125.21590423583984
Ratonneau and Pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Chteau dIf but Ratonneau and Pomgue are inhabited as is also the islet of Daume	58.38505935668945
Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dants venture	46.18491744995117
The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Chteau dIf Dants nevertheless determined to make for them	45.500823974609375
But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	141.67611694335938
At this moment he saw the light of Planier gleaming in front of him like a star	73.24981689453125
By leaving this light on the right he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find it	792.406494140625
But as we have said it was at least a league from the Chteau dIf to this island	963.9605712890625
Often in prison Faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive	105.16800689697266
Dants you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion	61.7447395324707
These words rang in Dants ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength	193.74603271484375
He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy	121.76732635498047
Fear that relentless pursuer clogged Dants efforts	110.05043029785156
He listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness	37.02010726928711
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chteau but exhausting his strength	77.58016204833984
He swam on still and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness	32.42201614379883
He could not see it but he felt its presence	76.15933227539062
An hour passed during which Dants excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves	423.3895263671875
Let us see said he I have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if I am not mistaken I must be close to Tiboulen	77.072509765625
But what if I were mistaken	83.42251586914062
A shudder passed over him	249.30694580078125
He sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation	80.60458374023438
Well said he I will swim on until I am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then I shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	141.3174591064453
Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee	38.5764045715332
He fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing	85.18620300292969
Then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore	328.7489318847656
Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion	330.00555419921875
It was the Island of Tiboulen	207.08413696289062
Dants rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	356.8928527832031
Then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	51.92380905151367
At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	184.92454528808594
The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	145.84263610839844
Dants had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact Tiboulen	1.0368998050689697
He knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to Lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment	245.0111541748047
An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury	158.5166778564453
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray	187.07965087890625
He was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning	311.58807373046875
It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm	185.82376098632812
He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty hours	189.7233428955078
He extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	39.14765548706055
As he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness	36.64707565307617
By its light between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle a quarter of a league distant Dants saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves	175.12644958496094
A second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity	82.72537994384766
Dants cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves	157.16404724121094
Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder	71.78348541259766
The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind	316.494873046875
Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seabird	263.8475036621094
At the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	162.93594360351562
Dants from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	90.31629180908203
Then all was dark again	1020.5692749023438
Dants ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	279.7661437988281
By degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars	73.56674194335938
Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold	92.72306823730469
It was day	104.88714599609375
Dants stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the Chteau dIf he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	166.72756958007812
He turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land	74.76982879638672
The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene	173.96853637695312
It was about five oclock	42.465877532958984
The sea continued to get calmer	84.78646850585938
In two or three hours thought Dants the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	47.381690979003906
Then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered will be questioned	64.61511993408203
Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive	292.9925537109375
The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished	39.10909652709961
The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea	164.56134033203125
I am cold I am hungry	121.18154907226562
I have lost even the knife that saved me	129.45887756347656
Oh my God I have suffered enough surely Have pity on me and do for me what I am unable to do for myself	265.9972839355469
As Dants his eyes turned in the direction of the Chteau dIf uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomgue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan	89.74895477294922
She was coming out of Marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	1.014039158821106
Oh cried Edmond to think that in half an hour I could join her did I not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to Marseilles What can I do What story can I invent under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action	51.7689208984375
I must wait	143.1772918701172
But I cannotI am starving	78.50692749023438
In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress	21.643875122070312
I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night	40.88817596435547
My story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me	78.04853057861328
As he spoke Dants looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecked and started	45.373470306396484
The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the crag	51.75749206542969
In an instant Dants plan was formed	173.31137084960938
He swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking	116.73722076416016
I am saved murmured he	62.49917221069336
And this conviction restored his strength	71.34062957763672
He soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the Chteau dIf and the tower of Planier	148.99261474609375
For an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for Italy between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne	59.14921569824219
However the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him	50.40442657470703
He rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack	81.37397003173828
Dants would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	360.7981262207031
It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention	464.884521484375
Dants though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him	141.33489990234375
Then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	90.90241241455078
By a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	155.66912841796875
This time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him	110.95117950439453
At the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	144.6665496826172
An instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him	694.8966674804688
Dants let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them	54.42262268066406
But he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him	61.82619857788086
His arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless	150.80532836914062
He shouted again	140.35543823242188
The two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in Italian Courage	93.99485778808594
The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head	183.4997100830078
He rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet	166.71070861816406
The water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	132.94175720214844
A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	155.76246643066406
He felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	62.16932678222656
He had fainted	125.81260681152344
When he opened his eyes Dants found himself on the deck of the tartan	69.9600830078125
His first care was to see what course they were taking	256.4436340332031
They were rapidly leaving the Chteau dIf behind	290.1239013671875
Dants was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	91.13578796386719
As we have said he was lying on the deck	201.20526123046875
A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out Courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow	741.1220092773438
A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity	180.92893981933594
Who are you said the pilot in bad French	149.09800720214844
I am replied Dants in bad Italian a Maltese sailor	243.36343383789062
We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain	72.58259582519531
The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks	62.11326599121094
Where do you come from	100.79292297363281
From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost	167.38650512695312
I saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	72.08654022216797
You have saved my life and I thank you continued Dants	119.44158935546875
I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair	88.4021987915039
It was I said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking	125.47052001953125
Yes returned Dants holding out his hand I thank you again	245.39031982421875
I almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long	179.79566955566406
Dants recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Chteau dIf	33.06056213378906
Yes said he I made a vow to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires	70.59197998046875
Now what are we to do with you said the captain	65.4220962524414
Alas anything you please	413.0765686035156
My captain is dead I have barely escaped but I am a good sailor	89.37501525878906
Leave me at the first port you make I shall be sure to find employment	257.00909423828125
Do you know the Mediterranean	1.0227259397506714
I have sailed over it since my childhood	145.6658172607422
You know the best harbors	63.425872802734375
There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes	352.31842041015625
I say captain said the sailor who had cried Courage to Dants if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us	126.93608856201172
If he says true said the captain doubtingly	327.8158264160156
But in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards	435.4052734375
I will do more than I promise said Dants	79.4234848022461
We shall see returned the other smiling	46.679176330566406
Where are you going asked Dants	158.84332275390625
To Leghorn	91.45680236816406
Then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind	182.10633850097656
Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion	90.99092864990234
You shall pass it by twenty fathoms	683.2431030273438
Take the helm and let us see what you know	71.20356750488281
The young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient	111.93282318115234
To the sheets said he	106.02519226074219
The four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on	4130.67724609375
Haul taut	854.7268676757812
They obeyed	398.2193298339844
This order was also executed and the vessel passed as Dants had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	58.18855667114258
Bravo said the captain	139.39898681640625
Bravo repeated the sailors	248.6778106689453
And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing	53.86339569091797
You see said Dants quitting the helm I shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage	90.54637908935547
If you do not want me at Leghorn you can leave me there and I will pay you out of the first wages I get for my food and the clothes you lend me	88.83876037597656
Ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable	242.06593322753906
Give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned Dants	436.5365905761719
That s not fair said the seaman who had saved Dants for you know more than we do	145.81704711914062
What is that to you Jacopo returned the Captain	252.43809509277344
Everyone is free to ask what he pleases	175.26612854003906
That s true replied Jacopo I only make a remark	1.217150092124939
Well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them	481.97479248046875
No said Jacopo but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers	92.54537200927734
That is all I want interrupted Dants	121.64707946777344
Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted	117.60220336914062
Now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	365.27362060546875
A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time	163.8516387939453
He had not tasted food for forty hours	93.80103302001953
A piece of bread was brought and Jacopo offered him the gourd	201.86557006835938
Larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman	151.6796875
Dants glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in midair	45.34842300415039
Hollo what s the matter at the Chteau dIf said the captain	99.5525894165039
A small white cloud which had attracted Dants attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the Chteau dIf	116.30028533935547
At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard	140.39466857910156
The sailors looked at one another	108.60536193847656
What is this asked the captain	373.6529541015625
A prisoner has escaped from the Chteau dIf and they are firing the alarm gun replied Dants	41.8564338684082
The captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away	488.4860534667969
0277 m	322.8479919433594
Pretty strong rum said Dants wiping his brow with his sleeve	1.0256211757659912
At any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for I have made a rare acquisition	46.64802551269531
0279 m	260.22540283203125
Under pretence of being fatigued Dants asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade	281.71014404296875
Dants could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles	91.9280014038086
What is the day of the month asked he of Jacopo who sat down beside him	138.26287841796875
The 28th of February	87.95587158203125
In what year	120.4454345703125
In what yearyou ask me in what year	118.56001281738281
Yes replied the young man I ask you in what year	92.84898376464844
You have forgotten then	42.39107894897461
I got such a fright last night replied Dants smiling that I have almost lost my memory	223.0210418701172
I ask you what year is it	169.7105255126953
The year 1829 returned Jacopo	240.0910186767578
It was fourteen years day for day since Dants arrest	50.997650146484375
He was nineteen when he entered the Chteau dIf he was thirtythree when he escaped	1614.99462890625
A sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of Mercds who must believe him dead	136.9617919921875
Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	489.5057067871094
He renewed against Danglars Fernand and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	30.262807846069336
This oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn	348.06787109375
Chapter 22	142.9904022216797
The Smugglers	153.66952514648438
Dants had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast	109.48123168945312
Without having been in the school of the Abb Faria the worthy master of La Jeune Amlie the name of the Genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean from the Arabic to the Provenal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence as they have no visible means of support	403.7239990234375
It is fair to assume that Dants was on board a smuggler	190.44699096679688
At first the captain had received Dants on board with a certain degree of distrust	216.14857482910156
He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that Dants might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	268.3989562988281
But the skilful manner in which Dants had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Chteau dIf and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery	1.079041838645935
This made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	102.5251235961914
Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta which he knew as well as Marseilles and held stoutly to his first story	58.270687103271484
Thus the Genoese subtle as he was was duped by Edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded	99.83720397949219
Moreover it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe	207.03504943847656
In this state of mutual understanding they reached Leghorn	138.2946014404297
Here Edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years	60.9151725769043
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	135.1017608642578
His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled	14.210590362548828
As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn he remembered a barber in St	54.23573684692383
Ferdinand Street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	94.1927719116211
The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of Titians portraits	115.28726959228516
At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them	74.63785552978516
The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work	104.59856414794922
When the operation was concluded and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a lookingglass	46.97734069824219
He was now as we have said threeandthirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance	221.8418426513672
Dants had entered the Chteau dIf with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past	81.37487030029297
This was now all changed	182.8380889892578
The oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	195.4534912109375
0283 m	92.70560455322266
To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	143.35496520996094
As to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse	96.05701446533203
Moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf	74.35076904296875
Edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize himself	173.42050170898438
The master of La Jeune Amlie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which Edmond had accepted	117.0833511352539
His next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	1.0149574279785156
It was in this costume and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	103.6480712890625
Attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dants but Dants who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months	67.57813262939453
La Jeune Amlie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	30.93718719482422
He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons English powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark	42.4155158996582
The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of Corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France	107.3636703491211
They sailed Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	136.0897216796875
He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon	164.65357971191406
The next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found Dants leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	181.95106506347656
It was the Island of Monte Cristo	119.62784576416016
La Jeune Amlie left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Corsica	2669.70751953125
Dants thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	126.42227935791016
But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself Besides what would the sailors say What would the patron think He must wait	93.7024154663086
Fortunately Dants had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	333.6754150390625
Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him Besides were not those riches chimericaloffspring of the brain of the poor Abb Faria had they not died with him It is true the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial and Dants repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	190.0594482421875
0285 m	126.61612701416016
Evening came and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck	158.96258544921875
The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ships lantern was hung up at the masthead instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore	122.69815063476562
Dants noticed that the captain of La Jeune Amlie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so	409.0874328613281
But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	181.61187744140625
Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oclock in the morning all the cargo was out of La Jeune Amlie and on terra firma	75.52832794189453
The same night such a man of regularity was the patron of La Jeune Amlie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres or about eighty francs	275.8388366699219
But the voyage was not ended	270.29229736328125
They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	170.96543884277344
The second operation was as successful as the first La Jeune Amlie was in luck	288.1049499511719
This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars sherry and Malaga wines	59.12862777709961
There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of La Jeune Amlie	106.95672607421875
A customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded Dants was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder	43.33458709716797
Dants was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering	290.4270324707031
He had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher Pain thou art not an evil	128.4357452392578
He had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	89.74347686767578
Dants was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	31.899328231811523
Jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade	179.76036071777344
This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as Dants thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prizemoney manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall	1.015023946762085
Fortunately as we have said Edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women the wound soon closed	105.2848129272461
Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prizemoney but Jacopo refused it indignantly	219.66029357910156
As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection	221.36399841308594
But this sufficed for Jacopo who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others	1367.6915283203125
And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman	77.33358001708984
Then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails Edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of Jacopo as the poor Abb Faria had been his tutor	67.74577331542969
He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds	311.5950622558594
And when Jacopo inquired of him What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me Edmond replied Who knows You may one day be the captain of a vessel	163.1913604736328
Your fellowcountryman Bonaparte became emperor	89.55675506591797
We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican	134.56349182128906
Two months and a half elapsed in these trips and Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other	99.71939849853516
He had passed and repassed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there	137.08169555664062
He then formed a resolution	167.80398559570312
As soon as his engagement with the patron of La Jeune Amlie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresand under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo	229.9597625732422
Then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him	52.51084518432617
But in this world we must risk something	1.0113999843597412
Prison had made Edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever	118.7451400756836
But in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship	146.9951934814453
Dants was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del Oglio where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade	214.21263122558594
Already Dants had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy freetraders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds	107.0757827758789
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets stuffs of the Levant and cashmeres	205.52963256835938
It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France	208.1166229248047
If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	49.17411422729492
The patron of La Jeune Amlie proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category	97.60249328613281
At the mention of Monte Cristo Dants started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca	72.11445617675781
When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night	71.27008819580078
Edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly	1.03721022605896
Nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day	69.82024383544922
0289 m	56.59373092651367
Chapter 23	197.76441955566406
The Island of Monte Cristo	116.93360137939453
Thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny Dants was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion	220.20962524414062
One night more and he would be on his way	71.8487548828125
The night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dants mind	66.29753875732422
If he closed his eyes he saw Cardinal Spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	101.5716781616211
He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites	116.02837371826172
Pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves	150.58200073242188
Edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	133.72390747070312
He then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman	25.567665100097656
All was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off	352.19476318359375
The day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and Dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	154.6751251220703
Night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal Dants agitation	1.0066426992416382
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure	60.035030364990234
The old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of Dants over the crew and himself	148.62490844726562
He saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance	58.62469482421875
At seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	46.305694580078125
The sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the southeast they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world	35.434329986572266
Dants told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	86.2846450805664
When the Maltese for so they called Dants had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly	123.64550018310547
This frequently happened	117.66793823242188
Dants cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of Heaven	63.907691955566406
Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations	491.85784912109375
When the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze	74.24413299560547
They were making nearly ten knots an hour	596.1074829101562
The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon	54.645111083984375
Edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	65.79779815673828
Two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba	177.5010528564453
They were just abreast of Mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa	363.1650695800781
The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	150.11306762695312
Dants ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots	88.22151184082031
About five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting	138.8170623779297
Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes	77.27107238769531
Never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope	103.93061828613281
Night came and at ten oclock they anchored	113.89176940917969
La Jeune Amlie was first at the rendezvous	56.86518096923828
In spite of his usual command over himself Dants could not restrain his impetuosity	50.94333267211914
He was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like Lucius Brutus have kissed his mother earth	111.67670440673828
It was dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion	1.0072439908981323
The island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Amlieit was one of her regular haunts	55.534027099609375
As to Dants he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant but never touched at it	89.86591339111328
He questioned Jacopo	167.3209991455078
Where shall we pass the night he inquired	150.28079223632812
Why on board the tartan replied the sailor	232.0802001953125
Should we not do better in the grottos	90.12115478515625
What grottos	110.77588653564453
Why the grottoscaves of the island	81.1190185546875
I do not know of any grottos replied Jacopo	214.51754760742188
The cold sweat sprang forth on Dants brow	207.48167419433594
What are there no grottos at Monte Cristo he asked	88.20018005371094
For a moment Dants was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by Cardinal Spada	51.6729736328125
The point was then to discover the hidden entrance	81.86790466308594
It was useless to search at night and Dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	177.4963836669922
Besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which La Jeune Amlie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come	119.96202850341797
The boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cables length of shore	115.21483612060547
Then the landing began	106.25031280517578
Dants reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	132.8728790283203
Fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory	88.69041442871094
No one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowlingpiece powder and shot Dants declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude	247.53875732421875
However Jacopo insisted on following him and Dants did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust	38.103939056396484
Scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun	8069.44580078125
This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano was the bill of fare	78.37391662597656
Dants went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	56.88715362548828
Having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom Jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	129.12220764160156
Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	27.89597511291504
In two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs	17.747873306274414
At this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible	64.3538818359375
Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that I shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	29.014997482299805
Oh no exclaimed Edmond that will not be	672.9224243164062
The wise unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing	341.0562744140625
Besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life	72.81340026855469
Thus Dants who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth	8.004218101501465
The cause was not in Dants but in Providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	56.493534088134766
Meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod Dants approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	7.406889915466309
Keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man	138.21133422851562
Time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose	326.23193359375
Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen	125.13968658447266
So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	127.21731567382812
The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes	171.30300903320312
Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete	59.814151763916016
This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure	39.332584381103516
Only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret	38.78023910522461
0295 m	72.4100570678711
It seemed however to Edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	128.7782440185547
A large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead	25.911529541015625
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps	378.78485107421875
Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid	3866.216796875
Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon	165.16368103027344
The sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them	60.169212341308594
But even while they watched his daring progress Edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear	36.99748992919922
They all rushed towards him for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority yet Jacopo reached him first	113.01116180419922
He found Edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless	209.77259826660156
He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet	128.48382568359375
They poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly	57.688148498535156
Edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins	97.98370361328125
They wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under Jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	45.21394729614258
It may be supposed that Dants did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal	75.96452331542969
As for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	112.51123046875
The sailors did not require much urging	270.1058654785156
They were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious	81.53205108642578
An hour afterwards they returned	78.24382781982422
All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a mossgrown rock	110.40421295166016
But instead of growing easier Dants pains appeared to increase in violence	66.94183349609375
The old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France between Nice and Frjus urged Dants to try and rise	49.58677673339844
Edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale	170.57318115234375
He has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice	151.13510131835938
No matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him	98.22972869873047
We will try and carry him on board the tartan	99.21488952636719
Dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him	124.8836669921875
Well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you	73.95856475830078
We will not go till evening	109.71295166015625
This very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it	78.49348449707031
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution	88.289306640625
Dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	102.24742889404297
No no he said to the patron I was awkward and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness	213.2880859375
Leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me	92.2176284790039
But you ll die of hunger said the patron	162.60830688476562
I would rather do so was Edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me	28.6319580078125
The patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed	65.64559173583984
What are we to do Maltese asked the captain	273.1167907714844
We can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay	100.38521575927734
Go go exclaimed Dants	64.99569702148438
We shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again	59.50844192504883
Why said Dants if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to me	30.537307739257812
I will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to Leghorn	153.4990234375
If you do not come across one return for me	129.4189453125
The patron shook his head	58.02082061767578
Listen Captain Baldi there s one way of settling this said Jacopo	92.54973602294922
Do you go and I will stay and take care of the wounded man	16.502811431884766
And give up your share of the venture said Edmond to remain with me	110.24886322021484
Yes said Jacopo and without any hesitation	230.29148864746094
You are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied Edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but I do not wish anyone to stay with me	25.339988708496094
A day or two of rest will set me up and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises	132.4264373779297
A peculiar smile passed over Dants lips he squeezed Jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone	60.42934036254883
The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which Edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body	8.934331893920898
Then when they had disappeared he said with a smileTis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion	64.14515686035156
Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a waterfowl ere it takes to the wing set sail	112.70500946044922
At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was	76.70308685302734
Then Dants rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	43.62485885620117
And now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman which Faria had related to him now Open Sesame	95.23321533203125
Chapter 24	42.0715217590332
The Secret Cave	64.36747741699219
The sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat	38.00777053833008
Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	83.77006530761719
At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag	77.0562973022461
In a word the island was inhabited yet Edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of God	70.82029724121094
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed	227.58680725097656
This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction	184.15037536621094
But it was not upon Corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on Sardinia or on the Island of Elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud and Leghorn the commercial that he gazed	58.552391052246094
It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that Edmond fixed his eyes	239.6759033203125
The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the Island of Corsica	201.61314392089844
This sight reassured him	308.9220275878906
He then looked at the objects near him	125.80367279052734
He saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam	122.10631561279297
Then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality	68.5898208618164
Dants as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph	48.5543212890625
This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation	104.62924194335938
Then following the clew that in the hands of the Abb Faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Ddalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the Cardinal Spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure	45.301780700683594
It was this idea that had brought Dants back to the circular rock	1.0680086612701416
One thing only perplexed Edmond and destroyed his theory	407.1318664550781
How could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men	13.985329627990723
Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	133.6289825439453
Instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it	37.50650405883789
And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood	102.860595703125
He soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied	101.10594940185547
A large stone had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtlebushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth	98.41707611083984
0301 m	412.93341064453125
Dants dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	90.666015625
He attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	63.18377685546875
After ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	71.349609375
Dants went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	329.4811706542969
But the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he Hercules himself	85.3472900390625
Dants saw that he must attack the wedge	68.59178924560547
But how	50.2840690612793
He cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him	80.73563385009766
He smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose	41.021766662597656
With the aid of his pickaxe Dants after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	93.57060241699219
He lighted it and retired	59.1547737121582
The explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dants had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared	54.949462890625
Dants approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea	57.515769958496094
The intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	112.85511016845703
The rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	2642.66796875
Dants redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient Titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods	1439.79833984375
The rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean	22.184795379638672
On the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flagstone	17.04441261291504
Dants uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success	29.45291519165039
He would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause	30.40777587890625
This feeling lasted but for a moment	105.80525207519531
Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto	208.4613494873047
Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy	512.9457397460938
Dants turned pale hesitated and reflected	131.21543884277344
Come said he to himself be a man	77.89527130126953
I am accustomed to adversity	58.4921760559082
I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived	41.698368072509766
What then would be the use of all I have suffered The heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed	49.423858642578125
Faria has dreamed this the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did Csar Borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as I have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing	67.21399688720703
He remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet	80.54698181152344
Now that I expect nothing now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity	110.56495666503906
And he remained again motionless and thoughtful	169.77455139160156
Yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit	84.88302612304688
This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	647.2607421875
Yes Borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as I am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his aweinspiring progress	137.18991088867188
0303 m	188.2657470703125
But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked Dants of himself	52.68543243408203
The fate replied he smiling of those who buried Alaric and were interred with the corpse	40.839202880859375
Yet had he come thought Dants he would have found the treasure and Borgia he who compared Italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock	76.3369369506836
I will go down	49.30631637573242
Then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy Perhaps	26.118885040283203
But instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find Dants saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	60.868743896484375
After having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp Dants eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds	177.8690948486328
Alas said Edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes	34.54537582397461
But he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart	143.19839477539062
In the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will	48.7575569152832
He had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second	74.90586853027344
Dants continued his search	140.33811950683594
He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake	102.9538345336914
The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dants forehead large drops of perspiration	124.21599578857422
At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be	98.29898071289062
However he like Csar Borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	51.67373275756836
He again struck it and with greater force	46.39964294433594
Then a singular thing occurred	49.363800048828125
As he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	382.00823974609375
The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite	117.416015625
Dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices	104.14765930175781
It was there he must dig	202.9808807373047
But by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that Faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him	77.6729965209961
This last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint	336.6920166015625
The island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean	22.315000534057617
Dants had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern	77.30780792236328
The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	119.98925018310547
After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	229.26966857910156
He had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	89.62566375732422
The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception	33.34303283691406
At last after renewed hesitation Dants entered the second grotto	56.420528411865234
The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dants was surprised not to find in the outer cavern	113.5794906616211
He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	222.88975524902344
At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	130.0078887939453
But to Dants eye there was no darkness	92.67678833007812
He glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	43.23623275756836
The treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	346.3542785644531
The time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and Dants fate would be decided	53.42380905151367
He advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe	76.1248779296875
At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance	201.0746307373047
Never did funeral knell never did alarmbell produce a greater effect on the hearer	691.6500854492188
Had Dants found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale	51.910240173339844
He again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound	68.052978515625
It is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he	132.59925842285156
At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening Dants seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair	152.27392578125
A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	87.8216781616211
This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but Dants feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention	71.20088958740234
He thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	165.42172241210938
He wished to see everything	14.022686958312988
He approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood	124.92326354980469
He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	111.10216522216797
In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and Dants could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the Spada familyviz	112.42386627197266
a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the Italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinals hat	52.6276969909668
Dants easily recognized them Faria had so often drawn them for him	93.23577117919922
There was no longer any doubt the treasure was thereno one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket	40.34980392456055
In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious	52.36968994140625
Dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible	74.7855224609375
He sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	109.86078643798828
Dants inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings	103.54645538330078
The hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	225.21287536621094
0307 m	89.0717544555664
Edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	100.90670013427734
He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he reopened them and stood motionless with amazement	118.98539733886719
Three compartments divided the coffer	65.173095703125
In the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third Edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass	1.0245990753173828
After having touched felt examined these treasures Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea	269.7372741699219
He was alonealone with these countless these unheardof treasures Was he awake or was it but a dream Was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality	161.0554962158203
He would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of Monte Cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the seafowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels	115.67532348632812
This time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone	64.79317474365234
He soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity	96.00100708007812
He then set himself to work to count his fortune	95.37823486328125
There were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twentyfive thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI	57.475440979003906
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty	18.379905700683594
And he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth	263.84613037109375
Dants saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand	59.55885696411133
A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave	122.29359436035156
It was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime	89.8807373046875
Chapter 25	63.169376373291016
The Unknown	61.40836715698242
Day for which Dants had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned	273.4583435058594
With the first light Dants resumed his search	98.04553985595703
Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve	313.25225830078125
Descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savagelooking and untrodden as he had found it	85.87950897216797
This done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions	313.79541015625
To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealththat first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man	56.08171081542969
On the sixth day the smugglers returned	2425.545654296875
From a distance Dants recognized the rig and handling of La Jeune Amlie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landingplace he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident	5.9566264152526855
He then inquired how they had fared in their trip	61.36811828613281
To this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them	19.464454650878906
This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of Dants whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially	353.77459716796875
In fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica and so elude all further pursuit	1037.7032470703125
Upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly Jacopo expressed great regrets that Dants had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	177.9938201904297
0311 m	53.786460876464844
Edmond preserved the most admirable selfcommand not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as La Jeune Amlie had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn	170.34527587890625
Arrived at Leghorn he repaired to the house of a Jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each	135.9178009033203
Dants half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	111.76487731933594
The following day Dants presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dants residing in the Alles de Meilhan and also a young woman called Mercds an inhabitant of the Catalan village	112.04239654541016
Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which Dants hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was	100.25591278076172
The superior education of Dants gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy	52.822364807128906
The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board La Jeune Amlie having expired Dants took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further	173.48617553710938
The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles with directions from Dants to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo	154.73451232910156
Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor Dants proceeded to make his final adieus on board La Jeune Amlie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him	53.28555679321289
To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans	11.05151081085205
Then Dants departed for Genoa	278.7737731933594
At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman who having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fastsailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs	110.07846069335938
Dants struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	48.250362396240234
The proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	163.9479217529297
A bargain was therefore struck	37.23639678955078
Dants led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces	75.93074035644531
The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this Dants declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his beds head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself	40.75181579589844
The builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day Dants furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed	29.127714157104492
0313 m	165.06903076171875
Two hours afterward Dants sailed from the port of Genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	24.115697860717773
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dants handled the helm	142.46420288085938
The boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and Dants required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding	315.48626708984375
The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	490.4423828125
Some insisted she was making for Corsica others the Island of Elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of Monte Cristo	104.670654296875
Yet thither it was that Dants guided his vessel and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a firstclass sailor and had come the distance from Genoa in thirtyfive hours	763.0513305664062
Dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek	477.2967834472656
The island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it	47.798770904541016
Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker	157.7569580078125
A week passed by	56.76786804199219
Dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	66.51863861083984
The former Dants proposed to augment the latter to remedy	74.48877716064453
Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo	103.71041107177734
As it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo	82.10359954833984
He immediately signalled it	80.43234252929688
His signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht	84.33844757080078
A mournful answer awaited each of Edmonds eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had obtained	56.987335205078125
Old Dants was dead and Mercds had disappeared	46.195003509521484
Dants listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone	35.73832321166992
In a couple of hours he returned	49.331172943115234
Two of the men from Jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles	100.54618072509766
For his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercds	278.1908264160156
Without divulging his secret Dants could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	308.24017333984375
There were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself	314.7394714355469
His lookingglass had assured him during his stay at Leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper	205.1732940673828
One fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishingboat boldly entered the port of Marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the nevertobeforgotten night of his departure for the Chteau dIf he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither	1.055294156074524
0315 m	34.89868927001953
Still Dants could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect selfpossession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria Dants coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation	282.9239807128906
The first person to attract the attention of Dants as he landed on the Canebire was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon	70.54103088378906
Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	137.47483825683594
Going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	18.728010177612305
Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility Dants proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop	59.56022262573242
Dants instantly turned to meet him	49.87171173095703
I beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but I believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a twofranc piece and see you gave me a double Napoleon	71.14848327636719
Thank you my good friend	38.829532623291016
I see that I have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you	31.015647888183594
So extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank Edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment	89.5218734741211
Some nabob from India was his comment	123.94046783447266
Dants meanwhile went on his way	91.85740661621094
Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories	54.990352630615234
And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles from whence a full view of the Alles de Meilhan was obtained	96.86437225341797
At this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there	52.16691207885742
Recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	91.1142807006836
The nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house	112.31145477294922
Leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house	121.62248992919922
Then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let	97.1633529663086
Though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oftrepeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied Dants succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	76.95433044433594
The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them Dants sighed heavily	110.60819244384766
Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dants the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them	43.972747802734375
The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son	786.5714721679688
The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone	74.41802215576172
0317 m	83.29583740234375
When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him	76.52342987060547
As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire	79.9793701171875
Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Alles de Meilhan belonged Dants next proceeded thither and under the name of Lord Wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twentyfive thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given	66.5855941772461
The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of Dants were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc	131.8566436767578
that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited	34.95922088623047
This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the Alles de Meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth	255.94667053222656
But what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the Alles de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	64.75592041015625
But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishingboat with two seines and a tender	152.34400939941406
The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave Marseilles by the Porte dAix	62.318115234375
Chapter 26	82.00758361816406
The Pont du Gard Inn	89.21427917480469
Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegardea little nearer to the former than to the lattera small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard	39.491329193115234
This modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the Rhne	73.04524230957031
It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests	273.009765625
A few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	32.43135452270508
Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fanshaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the subtropical sun	84.20909118652344
All these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows one of the three curses of Provence the others being the Durance and the Parliament	89.7580337524414
In the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable	79.1685562133789
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passersby through this Egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note	117.62418365478516
For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servantsa chambermaid named Trinette and a hostler called Pecaud	191.77072143554688
This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach	5597.25
And as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the Rhne from which it had its source and the postroad it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description	200.3065643310547
The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fiftyfive years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deepset eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads	424.9842224121094
His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the Spanish muleteers	3866.216796875
This man was our old acquaintance Gaspard Caderousse	31.194602966308594
His wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle was pale meagre and sicklylooking	26.182710647583008
Born in the neighborhood of Arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue	91.861083984375
She remained nearly always in her secondfloor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the doora duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words	237.63856506347656
Hush La Carconte	70.16373443603516
It is Gods pleasure that things should be so	80.06828308105469
The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between Salon and Lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	79.4805679321289
Still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partners murmurs and lamentations	40.755889892578125
0323 m	50.9288444519043
Like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display	155.55738830566406
During the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators	1885.291259765625
He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia	8.483315467834473
But by degrees watchchains necklaces particolored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and Gaspard Caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	42.244441986083984
Caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grasson which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palateto the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing	82.21074676513672
At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentrylike watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday	108.6285171508789
There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara	375.6710205078125
Nevertheless had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist	53.84220886230469
The horse was of Hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace	24.746864318847656
His rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	102.59442138671875
Having arrived before the Pont du Gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say	112.99607849121094
However that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him	173.2922821044922
Availing himself of a handle that projected from a halffallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his ironshod stick	60.62785720825195
At this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	1.0363116264343262
At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter	64.75728607177734
0319 m	142.9062957763672
You are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished Caderousse	148.58877563476562
Now then Margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet Pray do nt heed him sirhe only barks he never bites	171.89051818847656
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day	22.588905334472656
Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain Caderousse hastily exclaimed A thousand pardons I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof	198.03590393066406
What would the abb please to have What refreshment can I offer All I have is at his service	108.02880096435547
The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong Italian accent You are I presume M	122.0627670288086
Yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it I am Gaspard Caderousse at your service	34.407039642333984
Gaspard Caderousse rejoined the priest	30.446979522705078
YesChristian and surname are the same	59.630245208740234
You formerly lived I believe in the Alles de Meilhan on the fourth floor	56.79439926147461
0325 m	78.5977554321289
I did	62.290931701660156
And you followed the business of a tailor	67.82662200927734
True I was a tailor till the trade fell off	225.80979919433594
It is so hot at Marseilles that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever	190.91107177734375
But talking of heat is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment	101.18553161621094
Yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off	188.70982360839844
As you please sir said Caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trapdoor in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen	67.77091217041016
Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abb seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while Margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellers face	187.780517578125
Are you quite alone inquired the guest as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	74.44686889648438
Quite quite alone replied the manor at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing	100.61198425292969
You are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment	111.26296997070312
Ah sir said Caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest	1.0574647188186646
The abb fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	522.1503295898438
Yes honestI can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbs gaze I can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays	71.40876770019531
0327 m	85.79740142822266
So much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abb for I am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished	50.037994384765625
Such words as those belong to your profession answered Caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases	106.47067260742188
You are wrong to speak thus said the abb and perhaps I may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error	75.29239654541016
What mean you inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise	37.89368438720703
In the first place I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search of	886.2847900390625
What proofs do you require	1.1696277856826782
Did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named Dants	1.4677362442016602
Dants Did I know poor dear Edmond Why Edmond Dants and myself were intimate friends exclaimed Caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	1.299588680267334
You remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond	2783.5244140625
Said to bear the name repeated Caderousse becoming excited and eager	1068.3897705078125
Why he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation of Gaspard Caderousse but tell me I pray what has become of poor Edmond Did you know him Is he alive and at liberty Is he prosperous and happy	106.480224609375
He died a more wretched hopeless heartbroken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon	32.09781265258789
A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	71.36390686035156
Poor fellow poor fellow murmured Caderousse	35.780967712402344
Well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper	87.77521514892578
Ah continued Caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the South the world grows worse and worse	27.221174240112305
Why does not God if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether	108.8939437866211
You speak as though you had loved this young Dants observed the abb without taking any notice of his companions vehemence	120.19202423095703
And so I did replied Caderousse though once I confess I envied him his good fortune	69.23941802978516
But I swear to you sir I swear to you by everything a man holds dear I have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate	56.336544036865234
There was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abb was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper	63.942378997802734
You knew the poor lad then continued Caderousse	51.0576286315918
I was called to see him on his dying bed that I might administer to him the consolations of religion	39.586700439453125
And of what did he die asked Caderousse in a choking voice	142.9180145263672
Of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow	40.41831588745117
0329 m	71.48773956298828
But the strangest part of the story is resumed the abb that Dants even in his dying moments swore by his crucified Redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention	24.30068588256836
And so he was murmured Caderousse	244.38340759277344
How should he have been otherwise Ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth	107.18054962158203
And for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it	137.8827362060547
And here the look of the abb becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse	59.59488296508789
A rich Englishman continued the abb who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on Dants upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dants had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement	613.6375732421875
Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor Dants carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune	79.02820587158203
Then I suppose asked Caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value	76.16590881347656
Why everything is relative answered the abb	631.430908203125
To one in Edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	127.47550964355469
It was estimated at fifty thousand francs	100.47002410888672
Bless me exclaimed Caderousse fifty thousand francs Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that	75.54039001464844
No replied the abb it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	39.11203384399414
I have it with me	29.565914154052734
The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure	161.75099182128906
Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abb opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship	23.73826026916504
And that diamond cried Caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs	61.590972900390625
It is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abb as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper	26.806331634521484
But how comes the diamond in your possession sir Did Edmond make you his heir	10853.6669921875
No merely his testamentary executor	1.0583453178405762
I once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed he said and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss	34.06931686401367
The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse	97.43555450439453
The innkeeper shivered	151.11456298828125
Another of the number continued the abb without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse is called Danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me	121.05767059326172
A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbs speech when the latter waving his hand said Allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	44.144134521484375
The third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was Fernand that of my betrothed wasStay stay continued the abb I have forgotten what he called her	27.417919158935547
Mercds said Caderousse eagerly	248.12147521972656
True said the abb with a stifled sigh Mercds it was	119.2353515625
Go on urged Caderousse	106.88229370117188
Bring me a carafe of water said the abb	73.04350280761719
Caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abb resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table	1.0454856157302856
Where did we leave off	186.60800170898438
The name of Edmonds betrothed was Mercds	38.25688552856445
To be sure	82.88908386230469
You will go to Marseilles said Dantsfor you understand I repeat his words just as he uttered them	58.0689582824707
Do you understand	94.78895568847656
You will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon earth	46.047855377197266
But why into five parts asked Caderousse you only mentioned four persons	304.9742126464844
Because the fifth is dead as I hear	716.0110473632812
The fifth sharer in Edmonds bequest was his own father	168.61497497558594
Too true too true ejaculated Caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die	53.3661003112793
I learned so much at Marseilles replied the abb making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dants I was unable to obtain any particulars of his end	23.163354873657227
Can you enlighten me on that point	40.55696487426758
I do not know who could if I could not said Caderousse	151.83592224121094
Why I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man	37.35620880126953
Ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died	82.58191680908203
Of what did he die	159.21170043945312
Why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis I believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but I who saw him in his dying moments I say he died of	160.59214782714844
Caderousse paused	92.29752349853516
Of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly	116.55950164794922
Why of downright starvation	79.97433471679688
Starvation exclaimed the abb springing from his seat	239.078369140625
Why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	171.04737854003906
The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a Christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians is too horrible for belief	29.14988899230957
Oh it is impossibleutterly impossible	255.8065948486328
What I have said I have said answered Caderousse	8.498456001281738
And you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs	102.44625091552734
Why should you meddle with what does not concern you	86.68143463134766
The two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of La Carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation	122.84918212890625
Mind your own business wife replied Caderousse sharply	1.1763466596603394
This gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse	77.6324462890625
Politeness you simpleton retorted La Carconte	73.80116271972656
What have you to do with politeness I should like to know Better study a little common prudence	37.07673645019531
How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you	381.61572265625
I pledge you my word madam said the abb that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly	21.742345809936523
Ah that s all very fine retorted the woman	123.25687408447266
Nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who can not even see whence all their afflictions come	152.89804077148438
Nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy I beg of you	42.307106018066406
Whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that I solemnly promise you	402.0798645019531
La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered	79.17817687988281
Again the abb had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him	49.77294158935547
When he had sufficiently recovered himself he said It appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone	73.64556884765625
Surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death	165.7701873779297
Why he was not altogether forsaken continued Caderousse for Mercds the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernandthe very person added Caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of Dants faithful and attached friends	35.58997344970703
And was he not so asked the abb	50.9288444519043
Gaspard Gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying	32.02651596069336
Caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abb said Can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself But Dants was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodys professions of friendship	191.0027618408203
Poor Edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	116.01873779296875
And whatever people may say continued Caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry I can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living	83.00013732910156
Imbecile exclaimed La Carconte	24.233217239379883
Do you then know in what manner Fernand injured Dants inquired the abb of Caderousse	38.777549743652344
Do I No one better	167.77894592285156
Speak out then say what it was	68.4098129272461
Gaspard cried La Carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue	149.79037475585938
Well wife replied Caderousse I do nt know but what you re right	103.88790893554688
So you will say nothing asked the abb	98.05437469482422
Why what good would it do asked Caderousse	133.15557861328125
If the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps I should not hesitate	70.67732238769531
But you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him	1.0249406099319458
You prefer then said the abb that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship	206.2059783935547
That is true enough returned Caderousse	360.2869873046875
You say truly the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the ocean	192.52992248535156
Remember chimed in La Carconte those two could crush you at a single blow	184.0913848876953
How so inquired the abb	84.00923919677734
Are these persons then so rich and powerful	193.37452697753906
Do you not know their history	41.83586120605469
I do not	105.11922454833984
Pray relate it to me	327.29803466796875
Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said No truly it would take up too much time	3.027617931365967
Well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part I respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	139.53192138671875
I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfil my promise to the dying man	95.89970397949219
My first business will be to dispose of this diamond	90.46727752685547
So saying the abb again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse	186.7701873779297
Wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here	33.801170349121094
Diamond exclaimed La Carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about	265.89239501953125
Why did you not hear all we said inquired Caderousse	96.57341003417969
It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dants to be sold and the money divided between his father Mercds his betrothed bride Fernand Danglars and myself	786.5103759765625
The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs	151.03733825683594
Oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman	67.28007507324219
The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked Caderousse	648.7520141601562
It does replied the abb with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dants which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors	194.09695434570312
And why among us four inquired Caderousse	160.02777099609375
As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him	83.1589126586914
I do nt call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice	80.23468780517578
Of course not rejoined Caderousse quickly no more do I and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now	130.92901611328125
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime	21.742345809936523
Remember answered the abb calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that I do so	88.11799621582031
You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars in order that I may execute Edmonds last wishes	329.657958984375
The agitation of Caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow	300.3193359375
As he saw the abb rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	107.02545166015625
0335 m	1.0977561473846436
There you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose	139.54708862304688
Do you believe it	43.62504577636719
Why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us	68.58671569824219
Well replied La Carconte do as you like	54.54230499267578
For my part I wash my hands of the affair	80.5643081665039
So saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	100.27862548828125
Arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband Gaspard consider well what you are about to do	137.6383056640625
I have both reflected and decided answered he	116.88626861572266
La Carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted	676.1875610351562
Well asked the abb as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do	88.76482391357422
To tell you all I know was the reply	86.58204650878906
I certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest	183.1023712158203
Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all	153.15847778320312
I hope it may be so replied Caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	43.6182746887207
I am all attention said the abb	70.28900909423828
Stop a minute answered Caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves	169.03736877441406
With these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night	194.16822814941406
During this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease	171.1226806640625
He removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	110.45076751708984
Remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of La Carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below	29.92652130126953
Enough enough replied Caderousse say no more about it I will take all the consequences upon myself	76.40914916992188
And he began his story	214.36732482910156
Chapter 27	151.73219299316406
The Story	45.66688919067383
First sir said Caderousse you must make me a promise	306.57440185546875
What is that inquired the abb	187.38775634765625
Why if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them for the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me I should break to pieces like glass	50.755252838134766
Make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	267.0020751953125
I am a priest and confessions die in my breast	196.2964324951172
Recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	55.9429817199707
Speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth I do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides I am an Italian and not a Frenchman and belong to God and not to man and I shall shortly retire to my convent which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man	369.9707946777344
This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage	129.05142211914062
Well then under these circumstances said Caderousse I will I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable	118.52739715576172
Begin with his father if you please	66.99668884277344
said the abb Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love	15.290008544921875
The history is a sad one sir said Caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it	70.49295043945312
answered the abb Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles	1.268557071685791
At La Rserve Oh yes I can see it all before me this moment	55.71223449707031
Was it not his betrothal feast	28.505205154418945
It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and Dants was arrested	96.43416595458984
Yes and up to this point I know all said the priest	116.06560516357422
Dants himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them	132.91432189941406
Well when Dants was arrested Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad	211.3216094970703
The old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself I assure you I could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast	173.1545867919922
The next day Mercds came to implore the protection of M	76.685791015625
de Villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heartbroken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent	7889.4814453125
No was the old mans reply I will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if I did not wait here for him I heard all this from the window for I was anxious that Mercds should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moments repose	106.7382583618164
But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	116.65892028808594
Ah sir replied Caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides I know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me	59.39216232299805
One night however I heard his sobs and I could not resist my desire to go up to him but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying	25.60137367248535
I can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and I who am no canter and hate the Jesuits said then to myself It is really well and I am very glad that I have not any children for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying I should throw myself into the sea at once for I could not bear it	51.319705963134766
Poor father murmured the priest	35.605934143066406
From day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary	85.8936767578125
Morrel and Mercds came to see him but his door was closed and although I was certain he was at home he would not make any answer	54.646305084228516
One day when contrary to his custom he had admitted Mercds and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to herBe assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us I am quite happy for I am the oldest and of course shall see him first	61.72195053100586
However well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old Dants was left all to himself and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but I guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence	29.997804641723633
At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him	119.96785736083984
I know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his	124.14672088623047
For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth I heard nothing	39.38982009887695
I then resolved to go up to him at all risks	85.419677734375
The door was closed but I looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill I went and told M	75.6964111328125
Morrel and then ran on to Mercds	58.92757797241211
They both came immediately M	106.65918731689453
Morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet	50.4651985168457
I was there too and I never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	57.80134582519531
From that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet	163.2347869873047
The abb uttered a kind of groan	149.30226135253906
The story interests you does it not sir inquired Caderousse	74.22930145263672
Yes replied the abb it is very affecting	1.0810819864273071
Mercds came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home	43.50857162475586
This was M	54.769649505615234
Morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	133.01797485351562
Mercds remained therefore by his bedside and M	168.35635375976562
Morrel went away making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimneypiece but availing himself of the doctors order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to Mercds If you ever see my Edmond again tell him I die blessing him	90.44316101074219
The abb rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat	132.721923828125
And you believe he died	137.8445281982422
Of hunger sir of hunger said Caderousse	95.21123504638672
I am as certain of it as that we two are Christians	116.83789825439453
The abb with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks	72.49857330322266
This was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	179.2261962890625
The more so sir as it was mens and not Gods doing	141.05348205566406
Tell me of those men said the abb and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything	7.2592597007751465
Tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine	237.4375
Two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionFernand and Danglars	107.72982788085938
How was this jealousy manifested Speak on	35.14382553100586
They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent	19.473224639892578
Which of the two denounced him Which was the real delinquent	280.4783630371094
Both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post	76.28115844726562
And where was this letter written	951.56689453125
At La Rserve the day before the betrothal feast	186.07461547851562
Twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	62.59944152832031
Oh Faria Faria how well did you judge men and things	142.08212280273438
What did you please to say sir asked Caderousse	66.23738098144531
Nothing nothing replied the priest go on	85.93120574951172
It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and Fernand who put it in the post	84.4991455078125
But exclaimed the abb suddenly you were there yourself	351.88018798828125
I said Caderousse astonished who told you I was there	227.12747192382812
The abb saw he had overshot the mark and he added quicklyNo one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eyewitness	35.01177978515625
True true said Caderousse in a choking voice I was there	93.86752319335938
And did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abb if not you were an accomplice	276.9101257324219
Sir replied Caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all perception	276.9101257324219
I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	177.8446807861328
I said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless	692.5213012695312
Next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when Dants was arrested	100.90054321289062
Yes sir I was there and very anxious to speak but Danglars restrained me	190.56890869140625
If he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the Island of Elba if he is really charged with a letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices	48.23927307128906
I confess I had my fears in the state in which politics then were and I held my tongue	81.6883316040039
It was cowardly I confess but it was not criminal	102.61428833007812
0341 m	95.89289855957031
I understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all	520.4935302734375
Yes sir answered Caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	91.07115173339844
I often ask pardon of God I swear to you because this action the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition	45.72623062133789
I am expiating a moment of selfishness and so I always say to La Carconte when she complains Hold your tongue woman it is the will of God	9.20956039428711
And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	36.46161651611328
Well sir said the abb you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon	25.20187759399414
Unfortunately Edmond is dead and has not pardoned me	138.32691955566406
He did not know said the abb	65.9866943359375
But he knows it all now interrupted Caderousse they say the dead know everything	115.1076431274414
There was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	91.11245727539062
You have two or three times mentioned a M	115.28936004638672
Morrel he said who was he	59.99202346801758
The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dants	87.06033325195312
And what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abb	30.34808921813965
The part of an honest man full of courage and real regard	134.7880096435547
Twenty times he interceded for Edmond	195.78285217285156
When the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist	110.65740966796875
Ten times as I told you he came to see Dants father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as I have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old mans debts and buried him decently and so Edmonds father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone	732.115478515625
I have the purse still by mea large one made of red silk	31.910337448120117
And asked the abb is M	493.41339111328125
Morrel still alive	33.53580856323242
Yes replied Caderousse	53.667320251464844
In that case replied the abb he should be a man blessed of God rich happy	79.78278350830078
Caderousse smiled bitterly	113.1042709350586
Yes happy as myself said he	29.134872436523438
What M	234.6894073486328
Morrel unhappy exclaimed the abb	44.12403869628906
He is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishonor	60.868221282958984
Yes continued Caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles M	106.8061294555664
Morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dants commanded and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo	45.55629348754883
If this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man	38.06588363647461
And has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb	42.57927322387695
Yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to we d the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows	31.82878303527832
If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end	101.37774658203125
Horrible ejaculated the priest	11.812315940856934
And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added Caderousse	40.96595764160156
You see I who never did a bad action but that I have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and I unable to do anything in the world for her I shall die of hunger as old Dants did while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth	68.66996765136719
How is that	2379.061279296875
Because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery	351.4976806640625
What has become of Danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty	114.06312561035156
What has become of him Why he left Marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of M	1.0608205795288086
Morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a Spanish bank	83.51079559326172
During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army and made a fortune then with that money he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital and having first married his bankers daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a Madame de Nargonne daughter of M	177.37371826171875
de Servieux the kings chamberlain who is in high favor at court	119.13027954101562
He is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the Baron Danglars with a fine residence in the Rue du MontBlanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and I know not how many millions in his strongbox	85.2795181274414
Ah said the abb in a peculiar tone he is happy	126.01284790039062
Happy Who can answer for that Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness Danglars is happy	88.272216796875
And Fernand	253.05215454101562
Fernand Why much the same story	79.73729705810547
But how could a poor Catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune I confess this staggers me	85.57007598876953
And it has staggered everybody	102.69377899169922
There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows	96.53684997558594
But then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position	87.9990005493164
Both sirhe has both fortune and positionboth	156.02487182617188
This must be impossible	77.24475860595703
It would seem so but listen and you will understand	1.0649969577789307
Some days before the return of the emperor Fernand was drafted	56.406002044677734
The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans but Napoleon returned a special levy was made and Fernand was compelled to join	1067.2720947265625
I went too but as I was older than Fernand and had just married my poor wife I was only sent to the coast	34.204124450683594
Fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of Ligny	167.30502319335938
The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy	109.04680633544922
That same night the general was to go over to the English	223.7493133544922
He proposed to Fernand to accompany him Fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general	66.40764617919922
Fernand would have been courtmartialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons	126.9673843383789
He returned to France with the epaulet of sublieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the Spanish warthat is to say at the time when Danglars made his early speculations	81.89402770996094
Fernand was a Spaniard and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellowcountrymen found Danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of Trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor	190.56907653808594
Destiny destiny murmured the abb	329.3102722167969
Yes but listen this was not all	41.94554138183594
The war with Spain being ended Fernands career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe	77.6141586303711
Greece only had risen against Turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards Athensit was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks	50.864776611328125
The French government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance	1.0361621379852295
Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece still having his name kept on the army roll	144.73776245117188
0345 m	158.1612091064453
Some time after it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf this was the name he bore had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructorgeneral	37.98295974731445
Ali Pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to France when he was gazetted lieutenantgeneral	127.87769317626953
So that now inquired the abb	47.99037551879883
So that now continued Caderousse he owns a magnificent houseNo	71.29502868652344
27 Rue du Helder Paris	153.71751403808594
The abb opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at selfcontrol he said And Mercdsthey tell me that she has disappeared	145.43942260742188
Disappeared said Caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor	141.64349365234375
Has she made a fortune also inquired the abb with an ironical smile	144.4228515625
Mercds is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris replied Caderousse	91.09233856201172
Go on said the abb it seems as if I were listening to the story of a dream	120.0843276977539
But I have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might	1527.3817138671875
Mercds was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond	91.44686126708984
I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M	80.14199829101562
de Villefort her devotion to the elder Dants	167.5221710205078
In the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	144.37429809570312
This was the departure of Fernandof Fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother	174.63827514648438
Fernand went and Mercds remained alone	35.87199783325195
Three months passed and still she weptno news of Edmond no news of Fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair	35.026947021484375
One evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	40.99009704589844
Suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and Fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before her	129.77415466308594
It was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her	172.76805114746094
Mercds seized Fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow	62.638084411621094
And then it must be confessed Fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	118.58917999267578
Another possessed all Mercds heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	55.111419677734375
At this last thought Mercds burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old Dants incessantly said to her Our Edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us	24.253616333007812
The old man died as I have told you had he lived Mercds perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity	2848.32080078125
Fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he returned	87.84312438964844
He was now a lieutenant	82.20377349853516
At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercds at the second he reminded her that he loved her	278.9068908691406
Mercds begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond	552.7122192382812
So that said the abb with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	1037.7032470703125
What more could the most devoted lover desire Then he murmured the words of the English poet Frailty thy name is woman	60.47733688354492
Six months afterwards continued Caderousse the marriage took place in the church of Accoules	69.23265075683594
The very church in which she was to have married Edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms	52.08939743041992
Well Mercds was married proceeded Caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed La Rserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart	213.87796020507812
Fernand more happy but not more at his easefor I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmonds returnFernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself	121.95164489746094
There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles	129.0858154296875
Did you ever see Mercds again inquired the priest	132.84588623046875
Yes during the Spanish war at Perpignan where Fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her son	164.46218872070312
The abb started	87.77880859375
Her son said he	31.14507293701172
Yes replied Caderousse little Albert	66.63685607910156
But then to be able to instruct her child continued the abb she must have received an education herself	667.2980346679688
I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated	30.606033325195312
Oh replied Caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed Mercds might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent	35.613643646240234
Fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune	1.0970828533172607
She learned drawing musiceverything	49.44233703613281
Besides I believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart	138.8140869140625
But now her position in life is assured continued Caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet	85.00968933105469
Caderousse paused	46.44672393798828
And yet what asked the abb	149.9081268310547
Yet I am sure she is not happy said Caderousse	5.56544828414917
What makes you believe this	33.743038177490234
Why when I found myself utterly destitute I thought my old friends would perhaps assist me	265.2070007324219
So I went to Danglars who would not even receive me	34.94800567626953
I called on Fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechambre	230.6858367919922
Then you did not see either of them	50.88322067260742
No but Madame de Morcerf saw me	1523.6871337890625
How was that	79.76992797851562
As I went away a purse fell at my feetit contained fiveandtwenty louis I raised my head quickly and saw Mercds who at once shut the blind	44.22949981689453
And M	99.20514678955078
de Villefort asked the abb	254.95611572265625
Oh he never was a friend of mine I did not know him and I had nothing to ask of him	28.146360397338867
Do you not know what became of him and the share he had in Edmonds misfortunes	101.32279205322266
No I only know that some time after Edmonds arrest he married Mademoiselle de SaintMran and soon after left Marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as Danglars as high in station as Fernand	35.38209915161133
I only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten	100.59528350830078
You are mistaken my friend replied the abb God may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembersand beholda proof	153.0140838623047
As he spoke the abb took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to Caderousse said Here my friend take this diamond it is yours	96.50827026367188
What for me only cried Caderousse ah sir do not jest with me	104.94608306884766
This diamond was to have been shared among his friends	215.56312561035156
Edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided	52.717777252197266
Take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness	461.1818542480469
0351 m	11.286277770996094
Oh sir said Caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his browOh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man	33.401123046875
I know what happiness and what despair are and I never make a jest of such feelings	35.04899597167969
Take it then but in exchange	14.571824073791504
Caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand	848.15380859375
The abb smiled	63.1547737121582
In exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that M	210.63790893554688
Morrel left on old Dants chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your hands	122.53589630126953
Caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abb a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	70.76335144042969
The abb took it and in return gave Caderousse the diamond	13.77457046508789
Oh you are a man of God sir cried Caderousse for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it	2375.884765625
Which said the abb to himself you would have done	27.967905044555664
The abb rose took his hat and gloves	83.86519622802734
Well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and I may believe it in every particular	68.94316864013672
See sir replied Caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy woodhere on this shelf is my wifes testament open this book and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix	40.117916107177734
I will swear to you by my souls salvation my faith as a Christian I have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment	126.9212646484375
Tis well said the abb convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth	1253.046142578125
Tis well and may this money profit you Adieu I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other	85.12139892578125
The abb with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of Caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming	583.0385131835938
When Caderousse turned around he saw behind him La Carconte paler and trembling more than ever	77.97015380859375
Is then all that I have heard really true she inquired	68.82479095458984
What That he has given the diamond to us only inquired Caderousse half bewildered with joy yes nothing more true See here it is	105.57231903076172
The woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice Suppose its false	70.81533813476562
Caderousse started and turned pale	116.2247314453125
False he muttered	138.55148315429688
False Why should that man give me a false diamond	451.9052429199219
0349 m	304.80804443359375
To get your secret without paying for it you blockhead	129.7820587158203
Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea	36.61436080932617
Oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out	111.66578674316406
In what way	87.77909851074219
Why the fair is on at Beaucaire there are always jewellers from Paris there and I will show it to them	92.04704284667969
Look after the house wife and I shall be back in two hours and Caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken	206.66261291503906
Fifty thousand francs muttered La Carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune	813.684326171875

The Prison Register	123.04705047607422
The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire a man of about thirty or twoandthirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an Englishman presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles	131.12281799316406
Sir said he I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome	1.0383158922195435
We are and have been these ten years connected with the house of Morrel   Son of Marseilles	163.07266235351562
We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	52.33002471923828
I have come therefore express from Rome to ask you for information	233.6935272216797
Sir replied the mayor	493.0279235839844
I know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M	286.32562255859375
He has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	95.61597442626953
Ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of M	64.35489654541016
Morrel and I shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality	68.86359405517578
This is all I can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to M	113.49005889892578
de Boville the inspector of prisons No	99.88668060302734
15 Rue de Nouailles he has I believe two hundred thousand francs in Morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself	59.152374267578125
The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street mentioned	182.42601013183594
de Boville was in his private room and the Englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	94.2848892211914
As to M	188.97178649902344
de Boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past	134.96603393554688
The Englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles	686.511474609375
Oh sir exclaimed M	109.56787872314453
de Boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair	62.295745849609375
I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel   Son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month	260.26971435546875
I had informed M	159.98741149902344
Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last halfhour to tell me that if his ship the Pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment	86.75719451904297
But said the Englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment	126.7820816040039
It looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed M	77.78091430664062
de Boville despairingly	46.697879791259766
The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said From which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension	204.9669647216797
To tell you the truth I consider it lost	196.81427001953125
Well then I will buy it of you	269.809814453125
Yes I	145.65005493164062
But at a tremendous discount of course	202.13766479492188
No for two hundred thousand francs	93.2157211303711
Our house added the Englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way	69.64903259277344
And you will pay	115.11461639404297
Ready money	86.09542083740234
20023 m	86.57333374023438
And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of banknotes which might have been twice the sum M	363.689453125
de Boville feared to lose	49.711090087890625
A ray of joy passed across M	138.27857971191406
de Bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said	81.96986389160156
Sir I ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum	49.49126052856445
That s no affair of mine replied the Englishman that is the affair of the house of Thomson   French in whose name I act	143.56964111328125
They have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm	68.68244934082031
But all I know sir is that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt	125.25609588623047
I only ask a brokerage	291.38043212890625
Of course that is perfectly just cried M	81.0699462890625
de Boville	284.88775634765625
The commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more Whatever you say	75.41780090332031
Sir replied the Englishman laughing I am like my house and do not do such thingsno the commission I ask is quite different	59.50779342651367
Name it sir I beg	105.93928527832031
You are the inspector of prisons	97.47333526611328
I have been so these fourteen years	27.765947341918945
You keep the registers of entries and departures	56.38887405395508
I do	124.60047149658203
To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners	137.42129516601562
There are special reports on every prisoner	116.45172882080078
Well sir I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abb who disappeared suddenly	64.53681945800781
I have since learned that he was confined in the Chteau dIf and I should like to learn some particulars of his death	69.04427337646484
What was his name	46.38988494873047
The Abb Faria	132.12620544433594
Oh I recollect him perfectly cried M	114.71739959716797
de Boville he was crazy	124.0690689086914
So they said	58.768165588378906
Oh he was decidedly	18.449630737304688
Very possibly but what sort of madness was it	203.5675048828125
He pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him	139.77806091308594
Poor deviland he is dead	35.71727752685547
Yes sir five or six months ago last February	37.96357727050781
You have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well	56.18437957763672
I recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular incident	54.992950439453125
May I ask what that was said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance	231.36697387695312
Oh dear yes sir the abbs dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonapartes emissariesone of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man	146.3851776123047
Indeed said the Englishman	201.81954956054688
Yes replied M	94.8957748413086
de Boville I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers	38.63521194458008
That man made a deep impression on me I shall never forget his countenance	30.89111328125
20025 m	82.24383544921875
The Englishman smiled imperceptibly	122.42119598388672
And you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons	41.553810119628906
Were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this Edmond Dants	1.18740713596344
This dangerous mans name was	184.91976928710938
Edmond Dants	32.93067169189453
It appears sir that this Edmond Dants had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another	26.408254623413086
This tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape	30.536216735839844
No doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the Abb Faria had an attack of catalepsy and died	31.011619567871094
That must have cut short the projects of escape	28.238178253173828
For the dead man yes replied M	19.630067825317383
de Boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this Dants saw a means of accelerating his escape	45.63175582885742
He no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the Chteau dIf were interred in an ordinary burialground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment	255.6837921142578
It was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the Englishman	68.61392974853516
As I have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account	45.83009338378906
How was that	122.38850402832031
How Do you not comprehend	52.86459732055664
The Chteau dIf has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their feet	79.84303283691406
Well observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension	321.5105285644531
Well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea	171.3349609375
Really exclaimed the Englishman	142.40829467773438
Yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	73.0180435180664
You may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks I should like to have seen his face at that moment	73.01619720458984
That would have been difficult	1101.388916015625
No matter replied De Boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter I can fancy it	111.16368865966797
And he shouted with laughter	196.67091369628906
So can I said the Englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the English do at the end of his teeth	895.4429321289062
And so continued the Englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned	202.6322479248047
So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time	303.0448913574219
20027 m	60.03142547607422
But some official document was drawn up as to this affair I suppose inquired the Englishman	30.95793342590332
Yes yes the mortuary deposition	49.20517349243164
You understand Dants relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive	24.10733413696289
So that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience	34.43671798706055
He is dead and no mistake about it	16.985107421875
Oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please	31.570098876953125
So be it said the Englishman	18.60320472717285
But to return to these registers	264.5314025878906
True this story has diverted our attention from them	121.47764587402344
Excuse me	157.6980743408203
Excuse you for what For the story By no means it really seems to me very curious	47.56721496582031
Yes indeed	72.3405532836914
So sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abb who really was gentleness itself	50.59486389160156
Yes you will much oblige me	37.80266189575195
Go into my study here and I will show it to you	52.70558547973633
And they both entered M	253.4359130859375
de Bovilles study	120.78096771240234
Everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its place	81.26326751708984
The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the Chteau dIf giving him all the time he desired for the examination while De Boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper	113.09304809570312
The Englishman easily found the entries relative to the Abb Faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting Edmond Dants	114.57018280029297
There he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination Morrels petition M	140.16737365722656
de Villeforts marginal notes	65.80005645751953
He folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th April 1815 in which Morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for Napoleon was then on the throne the services Dants had rendered to the imperial causeservices which Villeforts certificates rendered indisputable	112.43667602539062
Then he saw through the whole thing	93.6849365234375
This petition to Napoleon kept back by Villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings attorney	36.34002685546875
He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name	112.795654296875
Edmond Dants	76.91229248046875
An inveterate Bonapartist took an active part in the return from the Island of Elba	40.32131576538086
To be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	54.740821838378906
Beneath these lines was written in another hand See note abovenothing can be done	91.84891510009766
He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in Villeforts handwriting	39.470130920410156
20029 m	19.6717472076416
As to the note which accompanied this the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dants situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt	54.08121109008789
As we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the Abb Farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading Le Drapeau Blanc	77.74150085449219
He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Rserve and which had the postmark Marseilles 27th February delivery 6 oclock P	98.72833251953125
But it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do however irregular it might be	652.4191284179688
Thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam I have all I want now it is for me to perform my promise	7.821390628814697
Give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and I will hand you over the money	34.4387321472168
He rose gave his seat to M	103.56185913085938
de Boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the Englishman counted out the banknotes on the other side of the desk	243.4997100830078
Chapter 29	229.01409912109375
The House of Morrel   Son	31.619142532348633
Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of Morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change	108.51844787597656
Instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentinstead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsinstead of the court filled with bales of goods reechoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom	259.15771484375
Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained	48.9645881652832
One was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with M	42.96318435668945
Morrels daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old oneeyed cashier called Cocles or Cockeye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted beehive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it	45.546504974365234
Cocles remained in M	67.84757995605469
Morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant	93.6593017578125
He was however the same Cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against M	339.1706237792969
Morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him	78.03858947753906
In the midst of the disasters that befell the house Cocles was the only one unmoved	49.387718200683594
But this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	40.035160064697266
Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse	106.3265380859375
Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure	127.40914154052734
Everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to Cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow	97.66348266601562
Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to M	55.74946594238281
Morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying	75.0212173461914
Thanks Cocles you are the pearl of cashiers	40.23540115356445
Cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of M	12.978466987609863
Morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns	1.0359591245651245
But since the end of the month M	47.4681396484375
Morrel had passed many an anxious hour	99.70419311523438
In order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate	45.88554000854492
By this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted	107.01131439208984
Credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M	29.98693084716797
de Boville M	36.754878997802734
Morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the Pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor	127.27701568603516
But this vessel which like the Pharaon came from Calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the Pharaon	87.26836395263672
20033 m	305.0455017089844
Such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with M	588.6964721679688
de Boville the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome presented himself at M	362.96612548828125
Emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house	282.23089599609375
The young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the newcomer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to M	88.2613525390625
Emmanuel and that his business was with M	185.66619873046875
Morrel in person	171.31764221191406
Emmanuel sighed and summoned Cocles	148.16567993164062
Cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M	81.14730072021484
Morrels apartment	53.825618743896484
Cocles went first and the stranger followed him	99.9192123413086
On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger	9.631996154785156
Morrel is in his room is he not Mademoiselle Julie said the cashier	38.85553741455078
Yes I think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	234.27581787109375
Go and see Cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman	25.351318359375
It will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the Englishman	48.799583435058594
Morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome with whom your father does business	117.72203826904297
The young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the staircase	29.49216079711914
She entered the office where Emmanuel was while Cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landingplace on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson   French alone returned and signed to him that he could enter	111.26593780517578
The Englishman entered and found Morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities	145.29136657714844
At the sight of the stranger M	142.26611328125
Morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	138.09690856933594
Fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirtysixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person	30.59889793395996
The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	60.89704895019531
Monsieur said Morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me	45.52069091796875
Yes monsieur you are aware from whom I come	46.536651611328125
The house of Thomson   French at least so my cashier tells me	60.836273193359375
He has told you rightly	71.12698364257812
The house of Thomson   French had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in France and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise	99.16698455810547
Morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration	204.5816650390625
So then sir said Morrel you hold bills of mine	57.18438720703125
Yes and for a considerable sum	143.903564453125
What is the amount asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render firm	47.73167037963867
20035 m	36.15628433227539
Here is said the Englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200000 francs to our house by M	161.2852783203125
de Boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due	106.12615966796875
You acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him	59.395782470703125
Yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago	127.56160736083984
When are you to pay	466.51043701171875
Half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next	254.82656860351562
Just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders	90.68002319335938
I recognize them said Morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature	39.554901123046875
Is this all	428.34478759765625
No I have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of Pascal and the house of Wild   Turner of Marseilles amounting to nearly 55000 francs in all 287500 francs	56.871639251708984
It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration	93.718994140625
Two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated he	156.65765380859375
Yes sir replied the Englishman	95.61784362792969
I will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities	91.51643371582031
At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale	219.36993408203125
Sir said he up to this timeand it is now more than fourandtwenty years since I received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for fiveandthirty yearsnever has anything bearing the signature of Morrel   Son been dishonored	44.08971405029297
I know that replied the Englishman	70.62210845947266
But as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality	74.29200744628906
Morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown	1.1387925148010254
To questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given	15.366687774658203
Yes I shall pay if as I hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which I have been the victim have deprived me but if the Pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone	248.0438690185547
The poor mans eyes filled with tears	135.84121704101562
Well said the other if this last resource fail you	107.12429809570312
Well returned Morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune I must habituate myself to shame	34.105960845947266
I fear I shall be forced to suspend payment	34.23847579956055
Have you no friends who could assist you	67.603759765625
Morrel smiled mournfully	152.14907836914062
In business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents	34.68123245239258
It is true murmured the Englishman then you have but one hope	38.542518615722656
But one	80.71581268310547
The last	62.59061050415039
The last	1641.839599609375
So that if this fail	42.763832092285156
I am ruinedcompletely ruined	37.26189422607422
As I was on my way here a vessel was coming into port	20.232967376708984
I know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship	60.44121551513672
And it is not yours	50.19202423095703
No she is a Bordeaux vessel La Gironde she comes from India also but she is not mine	58.7722282409668
Perhaps she has spoken to the Pharaon and brings you some tidings of her	206.08871459960938
Shall I tell you plainly one thing sir I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt	93.81932067871094
Uncertainty is still hope	74.62763977050781
Then in a low voice Morrel addedThis delay is not natural	66.4012222290039
The Pharaon left Calcutta the 5th of February she ought to have been here a month ago	1.2734675407409668
What is that said the Englishman	37.18455123901367
What is the meaning of that noise	102.17471313476562
Oh my God cried Morrel turning pale what is it	43.01369094848633
A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled sobs	66.08616638183594
Morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair	46.528221130371094
The two men remained opposite one another Morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity	15.937701225280762
The noise had ceased but it seemed that Morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	42.1025276184082
The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door	86.2581558227539
A key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible	204.78622436523438
There are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured Morrel Cocles and Julie	94.92076110839844
At this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared	51.6516227722168
Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	255.59481811523438
He would have spoken but his voice failed him	113.34700775146484
Oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings	52.573421478271484
Morrel again changed color	305.3042297363281
Julie threw herself into his arms	1.238634705543518
Oh father father murmured she courage	108.99774169921875
The Pharaon has gone down then said Morrel in a hoarse voice	105.1424789428711
The young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers breast	420.988037109375
And the crew asked Morrel	64.33323669433594
Saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor	2358.360107421875
Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude	83.80582427978516
Thanks my God said he at least thou strikest but me alone	49.67949295043945
A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman	44.712318420410156
Come in come in said Morrel for I presume you are all at the door	99.01195526123047
Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping bitterly	39.36603927612305
Emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight halfnaked sailors	108.64727020263672
At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	31.74332046508789
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrels family and the sailors at the door	146.5825653076172
How did this happen said Morrel	55.394859313964844
Draw nearer Penelon said the young man and tell us all about it	89.38021850585938
An old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands	86.73270416259766
Goodday M	220.65992736816406
Morrel said he as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from Aix or Toulon	249.0013885498047
Goodday Penelon returned Morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain	142.47879028320312
The captain M	33.22945785522461
Morrelhe has stayed behind sick at Palma but please God it wo nt be much and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty	15.960780143737793
Well now tell your story Penelon	112.14849853515625
20039 m	83.24057006835938
Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek placed his hand before his mouth turned his head and sent a long jet of tobaccojuice into the antechamber advanced his foot balanced himself and began	8.791915893554688
You see M	76.19347381591797
Morrel said he we were somewhere between Cape Blanc and Cape Boyador sailing with a fair breeze southsouthwest after a weeks calm when Captain Gaumard comes up to meI was at the helm I should tell youand says Penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there I was just then looking at them myself	54.76823425292969
What do I think captain Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they did nt mean mischief	277.8693542480469
That s my opinion too said the captain and Ill take precautions accordingly	15.245038986206055
We are carrying too much canvas	480.188232421875
Avast there all hands Take in the studdingsails and stow the flying jib	61.335819244384766
It was time the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel	109.7584228515625
Ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail Five minutes after it was down and we sailed under mizzentopsails and topgallant sails	64.49393463134766
Well Penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head Why I says I still think you ve got too much on	140.88180541992188
I think you re right answered he we shall have a gale	205.22232055664062
A gale More than that we shall have a tempest or I do nt know what s what	89.88601684570312
You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon luckily the captain understood his business	131.37815856933594
Take in two reefs in the topsails cried the captain let go the bowlins haul the brace lower the topgallant sails haul out the reeftackles on the yards	54.283939361572266
20041 m	43.082847595214844
That was not enough for those latitudes said the Englishman I should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker	3.810173511505127
His firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	339.7001953125
Penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manuvres of his captain	182.9447479248047
We did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare poles	69.74471282958984
The vessel was very old to risk that said the Englishman	56.73344421386719
Eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak	59.96022033691406
Penelon said the captain I think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold	201.9946746826172
I gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water	115.33251953125
All hands to the pumps I shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in	108.0190658569336
Ah said I after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once	70.46747589111328
Is that the example you set Penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute	54.24271774291992
He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	27.959259033203125
I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he	69.4455795288086
Well done said the Englishman	148.26934814453125
20043 m	133.5168914794922
There s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose	247.51974487304688
Two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five	33.09077072143555
Come said the captain we have done all in our power and M	110.9732437133789
Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves	200.54864501953125
To the boats my lads as quick as you can	94.39595794677734
Now continued Penelon you see M	11.43813705444336
Morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say Get alongsave yourselves	826.764404296875
We soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it	77.0167007446289
The captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so I took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then I jumped after him	151.49002075195312
It was time for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a manofwar	283.2483825683594
Ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then goodbye to the Pharaon	498.27069091796875
As for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw La Gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	112.30797576904297
There now M	99.53517150878906
Morrel that s the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings	53.040096282958984
Well well said M	65.47705078125
Morrel I know there was no one in fault but destiny	200.86964416503906
It was the will of God that this should happen blessed be his name	137.75485229492188
What wages are due to you	56.634117126464844
Oh do nt let us talk of that M	44.6599235534668
Yes but we will talk of it	113.94446563720703
Well then three months said Penelon	36.40198516845703
Cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said Morrel	211.82876586914062
At another time added he I should have said Give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account	68.86490631103516
Penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them	135.9010772705078
As for that M	106.96662139892578
Morrel said he again turning his quid as for that	130.73330688476562
As for what	46.68181610107422
The money	40.907257080078125
Well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest	146.84996032714844
Thanks my friends thanks cried Morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so	408.36358642578125
These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	299.3998107910156
Penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered	52.42230987548828
What M	166.1696014404297
Morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us	53.20158386230469
No no said M	77.38116455078125
Morrel I am not angry quite the contrary and I do not send you away but I have no more ships and therefore I do not want any sailors	30.242597579956055
No more ships returned Penelon well then you ll build some well wait for you	251.02613830566406
I have no money to build ships with Penelon said the poor owner mournfully so I can not accept your kind offer	62.67623519897461
No more money Then you must not pay us we can scud like the Pharaon under bare poles	31.784942626953125
Enough enough cried Morrel almost overpowered leave me I pray you we shall meet again in a happier time	37.98740768432617
Emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed	133.95223999023438
At least we shall see each other again M	128.41529846191406
Morrel asked Penelon	111.42559051513672
Yes I hope so at least	87.29470825195312
Now go	118.30554962158203
He made a sign to Cocles who went first the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear	48.91219711303711
Now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me I wish to speak with this gentleman	48.55942916870117
20045 m	102.38007354736328
And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson   French who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned	101.784423828125
The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features	85.7823486328125
The two men were left alone	152.49954223632812
Well sir said Morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and I have nothing further to tell you	193.36172485351562
I see returned the Englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you	44.448394775390625
Oh sir cried Morrel	402.88360595703125
Let me see continued the stranger I am one of your largest creditors	134.21238708496094
Your bills at least are the first that will fall due	64.54441833496094
Do you wish for time to pay	174.04437255859375
A delay would save my honor and consequently my life	40.50440979003906
How long a delay do you wish for	392.5979309082031
Morrel reflected	47.03654098510742
Two months said he	132.85386657714844
I will give you three replied the stranger	141.07305908203125
But asked Morrel will the house of Thomson   French consent	101.09187316894531
Oh I take everything on myself	20.568382263183594
Today is the 5th of June	57.67176055908203
Well renew these bills up to the 5th of September and on the 5th of September at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven I shall come to receive the money	81.58256530761719
I shall expect you returned Morrel and I will pay youor I shall be dead	63.06283950805664
These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them	39.00644302368164
The bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources	174.94065856933594
The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and Morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase	29.5084285736084
The stranger met Julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him	214.14715576171875
Oh sirsaid she clasping her hands	149.22589111328125
Mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed Sinbad the Sailor	63.90092468261719
Do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may appear	37.728477478027344
Yes sir returned Julie	9.954577445983887
Do you promise	2415.802490234375
I swear to you I will	163.20925903320312
It is well	54.80928039550781
Adieu mademoiselle	89.1674575805664
Continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband	141.6433563232422
Julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster	153.32559204101562
The stranger waved his hand and continued to descend	102.73766326904297
In the court he found Penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	216.84521484375
Come with me my friend said the Englishman I wish to speak to you	147.51710510253906
Chapter 30	89.10370635986328
The Fifth of September	222.63270568847656
The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson   French at the moment when Morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him	56.970462799072266
The same day he told his wife Emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family	1254.84765625
Unfortunately however Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson   French who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	61.20338439941406
When he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson   French towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300000 francs and have those 300000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again	111.01124572753906
Unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all Morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision	172.11500549316406
The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality	72.18115997314453
Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity	139.3257598876953
It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50000 francs of M	161.57894897460938
de Boville and on the 30th the 32500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man	331.3255920410156
The opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent	76.76917266845703
Great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality	136.59747314453125
Still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month	56.834144592285156
The month passed and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	59.32635498046875
Formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request	64.69318389892578
Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit	336.42559814453125
Fortunately Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July came	60.46770477294922
The agent of Thomson   French had not been again seen at Marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to Morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and M	43.51736068725586
Morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons	90.366943359375
As to the sailors of the Pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared	155.7421875
Captain Gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from Palma	71.51911163330078
He delayed presenting himself at Morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	137.5485382080078
The worthy shipowner knew from Penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	73.34187316894531
He brought him also the amount of his wages which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply for	350.5892639160156
As he descended the staircase Morrel met Penelon who was going up	186.24618530273438
Penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	175.2312774658203
When he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landingplace passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return	34.69838333129883
Morrel attributed Penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the Pharaon longer	81.36737823486328
Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	68.5923080444336
Worthy fellows said Morrel   as he went away may your new master love you as I loved you and be more fortunate than I have been	529.264892578125
20049 m	110.01868438720703
August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his credit or revive the old	75.2790756225586
On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel and his cashier Cocles to meet the creditors	159.56610107421875
But contrary to all expectation when the 31st of August came the house opened as usual and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	1628.0322265625
There came in moreover two drafts which M	281.0474548339844
Morrel had fully anticipated and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted	138.77186584472656
All this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of September	84.00399017333984
On the 1st Morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things	88.38062286376953
Morrel had thought of Danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former days since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth	42.94446563720703
It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit	151.31494140625
Danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save Morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and Morrel was saved	1.0442200899124146
Morrel had long thought of Danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	200.4364013671875
And Morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal	327.7772216796875
Yet on his arrival Morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word	203.91033935546875
He embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed Emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles	49.00636291503906
Then said the two women to Emmanuel we are indeed ruined	28.272520065307617
It was agreed in a brief council held among them that Julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at Nmes to come to them as speedily as possible	176.39456176757812
The poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended	208.4174041748047
Besides Maximilian Morrel though hardly twoandtwenty had great influence over his father	24.26849365234375
He was a strongminded upright young man	116.06250762939453
At the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young Maximilians taste	47.933372497558594
He had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School and left it as sublieutenant of the 53rd of the line	22.166898727416992
For a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy	40.4432258605957
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic	34.19036865234375
We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	119.66990661621094
This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure	222.40011596679688
They had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles Julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation	270.8111877441406
She would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed	386.90863037109375
Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune Who could ever have believed it	121.37146759033203
A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money	78.00154113769531
Morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money	131.6664581298828
All his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4000 or 5000 which making the best of everything gave him 14000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287500 francs	87.7069320678711
He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account	164.7050018310547
However when Morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	147.36181640625
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been	114.87335205078125
After dinner Morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the Phocens and read the Semaphore this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office	59.799381256103516
As to Cocles he seemed completely bewildered	121.62759399414062
For part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun	39.34458923339844
Emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered	60.46586227416992
The young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the Morrel family	52.13115692138672
Night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps	101.62612915039062
They listened he went into his sleepingroom and fastened the door inside	1055.3739013671875
Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after Julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing	109.58543395996094
In the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was Julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	14.184961318969727
The young lady went towards Madame Morrel	69.10240173339844
He is writing she said	142.40829467773438
They had understood each other without speaking	59.28557205200195
Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole Morrel was writing but Madame Morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper	38.87882614135742
The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word	108.75663757324219
Next day M	8.293911933898926
Morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom	8.365199089050293
In the evening Julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her fathers heart beat violently	36.9791145324707
The next two days passed in much the same way	123.16175079345703
On the evening of the 4th of September M	79.41189575195312
Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study	114.65380859375
Julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	81.99652099609375
Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment The young girl looked at Morrel	194.80459594726562
What have I done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me	130.636962890625
Nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only I want it	65.3414077758789
Julie made a pretence to feel for the key	92.05609130859375
I must have left it in my room she said	22.580078125
And she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel	85.59141540527344
Do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment	35.806846618652344
She questioned Emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	429.11529541015625
During the night between the 4th and 5th of September Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation	136.00440979003906
It was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	136.88827514648438
The mother and daughter passed the night together	74.37183380126953
They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening	87.16101837158203
At eight oclock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber	52.94929885864258
He was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage	13.135135650634766
They did not dare to ask him how he had slept	54.10878372192383
Morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been	47.24029541015625
He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	150.56871032714844
Julie mindful of Emmanuels request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly	37.57537841796875
Remain with your mother dearest	252.39442443847656
Julie wished to accompany him	135.0174560546875
I wish you to do so said he	284.27874755859375
This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and Julie did not dare to disobey	99.95795440673828
She remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	226.12237548828125
An instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead	177.2134246826172
She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy	97.66869354248047
20053 m	26.374282836914062
Maximilian my dearest brother she cried	338.0191345214844
At these words Madame Morrel rose and threw herself into her sons arms	1.1393938064575195
Mother said the young man looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened Your letter has frightened me and I have come hither with all speed	55.21047592163086
Julie said Madame Morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived	86.52554321289062
The young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	259.4356689453125
Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel inquired the man with a strong Italian accent	126.33158874511719
Yes sir replied Julie with hesitation what is your pleasure I do not know you	35.12908935546875
Read this letter he said handing it to her	112.43663024902344
Julie hesitated	75.20488739013672
It concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger	43.30915069580078
The young girl hastily took the letter from him	114.21040344238281
She opened it quickly and read	101.0218505859375
Go this moment to the Alles de Meilhan enter the house No	178.47486877441406
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father	197.35980224609375
It is important that he should receive it before eleven oclock	125.55323028564453
You promised to obey me implicitly	83.97960662841797
Remember your oath	249.85617065429688
Sinbad the Sailor	149.17843627929688
The young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared	1004.6893310546875
She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	158.08642578125
She read	52.973052978515625
It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	127.97626495361328
If you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it	150.94857788085938
This postscript decreased greatly the young girls happiness	118.74247741699219
Was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age	54.1826286315918
But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror	26.846567153930664
Julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel	1.097825050354004
Yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to Emmanuel	58.77968215942383
She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson   French had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter	97.16677856445312
You must go then mademoiselle said Emmanuel	91.6769027709961
Go there murmured Julie	136.068115234375
Yes I will accompany you	86.59269714355469
But did you not read that I must be alone said Julie	267.49755859375
And you shall be alone replied the young man	106.5599136352539
I will await you at the corner of the Rue du Muse and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy I will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me	158.57791137695312
Then Emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that I should obey this invitation	91.92414093017578
Did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it	52.2673454284668
But what danger threatens him then Emmanuel she asked	105.09130096435547
Emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him reply	128.99813842773438
Listen he said today is the 5th of September is it not	547.5371704101562
Today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay	95.5493392944336
Yes we know that	246.65872192382812
Well then continued Emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house	333.8428649902344
What will happen then	86.86990356445312
Why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt	128.40328979492188
Oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	84.8586196899414
During this time Madame Morrel had told her son everything	307.53857421875
The young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	58.13273239135742
He was thunderstruck	329.3175048828125
Then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain	165.56700134277344
While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father	38.62932586669922
Instead of going direct to his study M	122.80121612548828
Morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	40.07793426513672
Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant	52.82651901245117
He remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat	1.0720648765563965
Maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on Morrels breast	97.523681640625
Father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat	107.4744644165039
Oh this is what I feared said Morrel	37.6247444152832
Father father in Heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for	57.51941680908203
Maximilian replied Morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	146.58717346191406
Come and I will explain to you	60.70839309692383
And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study while Maximilian followed him trembling as he went	96.81104278564453
Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger	191.66549682617188
In this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his affairs	226.45773315429688
Morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 francs	167.5325469970703
All he possessed was 15257 francs	73.15340423583984
Read said Morrel	75.41093444824219
The young man was overwhelmed as he read	154.94989013671875
Morrel said not a word	226.48072814941406
What could he say What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures	237.48291015625
And have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments pause	173.44522094726562
I have replied Morrel	155.89874267578125
You have no money coming in on which you can rely	122.62596130371094
You have exhausted every resource	105.489990234375
And in half an hour said Maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored	150.96095275878906
Blood washes out dishonor said Morrel	68.5628433227539
You are right father I understand you	10.593899726867676
Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said There is one for you and one for methanks	87.2488021850586
Morrel caught his hand	393.62158203125
Your motheryour sister Who will support them	115.19841766357422
A shudder ran through the young mans frame	172.77603149414062
Father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live	124.32870483398438
Yes I do so bid you answered Morrel it is your duty	69.364990234375
You have a calm strong mind Maximilian	29.852441787719727
Maximilian you are no ordinary man	120.50685119628906
I make no requests or commands I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself	385.1806640625
The young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	100.55184173583984
Be it so then my father he said extending his hand to Morrel die in peace my father I will live	356.40240478515625
Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but Maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	148.0203399658203
You know it is not my fault said Morrel	176.44410705566406
20057 m	219.0717010498047
Maximilian smiled	184.76473999023438
I know father you are the most honorable man I have ever known	57.67879867553711
Good my son	230.4339599609375
And now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister	133.3025665283203
My father said the young man bending his knee bless me Morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said	46.13908004760742
Oh yes yes I bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me The edifice which misfortune has destroyed Providence may build up again	128.12548828125
On seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you	115.93490600585938
To you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me	241.0701446533203
Then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	270.4844055175781
Go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and fructify	248.25555419921875
Reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office My father died because he could not do what I have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what I should do	185.4607391357422
My father my father cried the young man why should you not live	46.0028190612793
If I live all would be changed if I live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if I live I am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagementsin fact only a bankrupt	253.36268615722656
If on the contrary I die remember Maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man	88.52385711669922
Living my best friends would avoid my house dead all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	28.98255729675293
Living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say I am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word	43.05940628051758
The young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned	100.42303466796875
And now said Morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away	67.7392807006836
Will you not see my sister once more asked Maximilian	1.0551865100860596
A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	17.791885375976562
Morrel shook his head	160.04296875
I saw her this morning and bade her adieu	311.5436706542969
Have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired Maximilian in a faltering voice	30.451602935791016
Yes my son and a sacred command	94.76071166992188
Say it my father	126.04974365234375
The house of Thomson   French is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishnessit is not for me to read mens heartshas had any pity for me	91.1811294555664
Its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287500 francs I will not say granted but offered me three months	226.2873992919922
Let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man	124.2209701538086
Father I will said Maximilian	129.42782592773438
And now once more adieu said Morrel	209.34461975097656
Go leave me I would be alone	114.8594970703125
You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom	206.20706176757812
The young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution	65.90474700927734
Hear me Maximilian said his father	493.4894104003906
Suppose I were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew I must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now Go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame	516.7881469726562
Yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said Be it so my father	940.977294921875
And he rushed out of the study	4695.78271484375
When his son had left him Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	54.02675247192383
After a moments interval Cocles appeared	125.86534881591797
It was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him	79.48546600341797
This thoughtthe house of Morrel is about to stop paymentbent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done	110.38794708251953
My worthy Cocles said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	125.27658081054688
When the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of Thomson   Frencharrives announce his arrival to me	70.45555114746094
Cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself	58.503665924072266
Morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	51.923683166503906
The hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	179.1171875
What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words	159.37660217285156
He was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	141.39004516601562
To form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to heaven	209.8971710205078
The minute hand moved on	61.54065704345703
The pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters name	44.54480743408203
Then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	122.694580078125
It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter	61.68146896362305
Then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	152.96739196777344
He took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol	104.99794006347656
At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heartstrings	202.03909301757812
He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study opened	22.52777862548828
Morrel did not turn roundhe expected these words of Cocles The agent of Thomson   French	187.32862854003906
He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth	32.97501754760742
Suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters voice	213.1363983154297
He turned and saw Julie	64.39593505859375
The pistol fell from his hands	146.59458923339844
My father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved And she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse	62.20722961425781
20061 m	64.18804931640625
Saved my child said Morrel what do you mean	166.48248291015625
Yes savedsaved See see said the young girl	54.714256286621094
Morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself	127.7618179321289
At one end was the receipted bill for the 287000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment Julies Dowry	92.76676177978516
Morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	203.28590393066406
At this moment the clock struck eleven	237.70846557617188
He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	58.30354690551758
Explain my child he said Explain my child he said explainwhere did you find this purse	71.82341003417969
In a house in the Alles de Meilhan No	365.90802001953125
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor	95.33403015136719
But cried Morrel this purse is not yours Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning	175.8593292236328
And did you go alone asked Morrel after he had read it	31.448352813720703
Emmanuel accompanied me father	120.75678253173828
He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Muse but strange to say he was not there when I returned	70.01361083984375
Monsieur Morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs Monsieur Morrel	90.72379302978516
It is his voice said Julie	29.653284072875977
At this moment Emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	531.944580078125
The Pharaon he cried the Pharaon	491.11328125
Whatwhatthe Pharaon Are you mad Emmanuel You know the vessel is lost	54.28921890258789
The Pharaon sirthey signal the Pharaon The Pharaon is entering the harbor	80.53592681884766
Morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheardof fabulous facts	93.64876556396484
But his son came in	29.332971572875977
Father cried Maximilian how could you say the Pharaon was lost The lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port	37.4907341003418
20063 m	67.57037353515625
My dear friends said Morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven Impossible impossible	65.23944854736328
But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond	27.678556442260742
Ah sir exclaimed Cocles what can it meanthe Pharaon	251.79818725585938
Come dear ones said Morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence	1.1310032606124878
They all went out and on the stairs met Madame Morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study	151.19638061523438
In a moment they were at the Canebire	87.36737060546875
There was a crowd on the pier	94.97947692871094
All the crowd gave way before Morrel	65.51296997070312
The Pharaon the Pharaon said every voice	19.39034080505371
And wonderful to see in front of the tower of SaintJean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters The Pharaon Morrel   Son of Marseilles	73.69795227050781
She was the exact duplicate of the other Pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo	52.964942932128906
She cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was Captain Gaumard giving orders and good old Penelon making signals to M	101.36053466796875
To doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	115.31596374511719
As Morrel and his son embraced on the pierhead in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face halfcovered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentrybox watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone	44.174564361572266
Be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds	114.69420623779297
20064 m	86.22196197509766
And with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hidingplace and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted Jacopo Jacopo Jacopo	127.79350280761719
Then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards Morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies	105.41658020019531
And now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart I have been Heavens substitute to recompense the goodnow the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked	198.81033325195312
At these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea	57.273807525634766
Chapter 31	240.37338256835938
Italy Sinbad the Sailor	142.26040649414062
Towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of Paris the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz dpinay were at Florence	176.58087158203125
They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year and that Franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy should act as cicerone to Albert	56.89474868774414
As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo or the Campo Vaccino they wrote to Signor Pastrini the proprietor of the Htel de Londres Piazza di Spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them	48.521514892578125
Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem	108.38703918457031
They accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left Albert started for Naples	79.40753936767578
As for Franz he remained at Florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited Corsica the cradle of Bonaparte to visit Elba the waitingplace of Napoleon	114.24690246582031
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crewTo the Island of Elba	47.618900299072266
The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at PortoFerrajo	96.2348403930664
He traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and reembarked for Marciana	283.4259033203125
Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded	157.22616577148438
The sport was bad Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper	201.87538146972656
Ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport	115.65364837646484
Do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea	46.629146575927734
Well what is this island	112.50086975097656
The Island of Monte Cristo	49.47222137451172
But I have no permission to shoot over this island	43.55549621582031
Your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited	170.60360717773438
Ah indeed said the young man	26.049945831298828
A desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity	250.26434326171875
It is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation	410.8625183105469
To whom does this island belong	27.801345825195312
To Tuscany	32.6690559387207
What game shall I find there	55.411712646484375
Thousands of wild goats	68.48583221435547
Who live upon the stones I suppose said Franz with an incredulous smile	375.6092224121094
No but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks	579.1603393554688
Where can I sleep	17425.232421875
On shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you likewe can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars	103.9759292602539
As Franz had sufficient time and his apartments at Rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition	183.58084106445312
Upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone	135.6488494873047
Well asked he what now Is there any difficulty in the way	117.08821105957031
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port	54.519371032714844
What do you mean	204.03941345214844
Monte Cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica Sardinia and Africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn	75.82621002197266
The deuce That puts a different face on the matter	58.46094512939453
Six days Why that s as long as the Almighty took to make the world Too long a waittoo long	155.7259979248047
But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo	60.93739700317383
Oh I shall not cried Franz	105.71634674072266
Nor I nor I chorused the sailors	22.01625633239746
Then steer for Monte Cristo	219.62867736816406
The captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	19.072599411010742
Franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the conversation	26.987014770507812
Gaetano said he to the captain you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats	19.916542053222656
Yes your excellency and it is true	181.58477783203125
I knew there were smugglers but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat	91.213134765625
Your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII	176.09335327148438
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of Rome	46.57764434814453
Has not your excellency heard that the French charg daffaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri	120.24195098876953
Oh yes I heard that	83.83184814453125
Well then if like us your excellency lived at Leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an English yacht that was expected at Bastia at PortoFerrajo or at Civita Vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	240.1025848388672
Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest	136.10003662109375
But asked Franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French Sardinian or Tuscan governments	100.99551391601562
Why said Gaetano with a smile	81.45390319824219
Yes why	41.77799987792969
Because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyones neck a fourandtwentypound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessels bottom and then they leave her	15.24801254272461
At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	23.60561180114746
First one gunl goes under then the other	41.720130920410156
Then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	173.91322326660156
All at once there s a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the deck	54.26072311401367
Soon the water rushes out of the scupperholes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea	35.90731430053711
Do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port	231.2600860595703
It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition Franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back	147.8495635986328
He was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness	53.05255126953125
Calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust	59.52629470825195
Bah said he I have travelled through Sicily and CalabriaI have sailed two months in the Archipelago and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate	56.02341842651367
I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied Gaetano but you questioned me and I have answered that s all	119.83663940429688
Yes and your conversation is most interesting and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for Monte Cristo	184.5562286376953
The wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage	37.432518005371094
As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices	77.72322845458984
As for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone visible	287.4164123535156
They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant Adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow	54.21427536010742
Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark	52.5076789855957
Fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the Tuscan Archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity Franz was not without uneasinessCorsica had long since disappeared and Monte Cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	114.1957015991211
An hour had passed since the sun had set when Franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor	39.7420539855957
What is this light asked he	243.88365173339844
Hush said the captain it is a fire	23.094633102416992
But you told me the island was uninhabited	54.95271682739258
I said there were no fixed habitations on it but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers	55.646522521972656
And for pirates	96.07386779785156
And for pirates returned Gaetano repeating Franzs words	102.910400390625
It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us	82.01396179199219
But this fire continued Franz	86.43260192871094
It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire	183.7925567626953
Oh that goes for nothing said Gaetano	23.41961669921875
If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from Pianosa but only from the sea	88.38727569580078
You think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors	1.0848982334136963
That is what we must find out returned Gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star	57.78833770751953
How can you find out	13.870150566101074
You shall see	1006.13232421875
Gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land	43.17085266113281
The pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it	12.683900833129883
Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest	51.94309616088867
All this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken	251.00518798828125
Gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult	114.1341323852539
As for Franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly	153.99168395996094
During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	2847.89306640625
This track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	36.169490814208984
Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board	134.05555725097656
Well exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison	15.696091651916504
They are Spanish smugglers said he they have with them two Corsican bandits	109.34193420410156
And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers	60.31724166870117
Alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	44.7375602722168
Very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you ca nt refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea	43.33584213256836
This costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcreature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption	55.089664459228516
Ah said Franz then you are a smuggler occasionally Gaetano	453.2445068359375
Your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably	32.98042678833008
Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo	60.30763626098633
Oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs	32.80228042602539
And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land	94.87835693359375
Nothing at all smugglers are not thieves	33.76898956298828
But these two Corsican bandits said Franz calculating the chances of peril	53.24515914916992
It is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities	70.96941375732422
How so	64.7603988647461
Because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a Corsicans nature to revenge himself	1.128934621810913
What do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said Franz continuing his investigation	86.90371704101562
I mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain	13.622007369995117
Well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits	201.87307739257812
Do you think they will grant it	19.236949920654297
Without doubt	158.1569061279297
How many are they	34.70185852050781
Four and the two bandits make six	65.69894409179688
Just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to Monte Cristo	340.1672058105469
Yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions	249.4120635986328
By all means be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses I do more than permit I exhort you	101.23451232910156
Silence then said Gaetano	10.35521125793457
Everyone obeyed	136.78114318847656
For a man who like Franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one	27.42045021057129
He was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	257.301025390625
On the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	99.59651184082031
The history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand	144.79913330078125
The sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves	51.27280807495117
Through the darkness Franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated	226.9385528564453
The blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around	191.18380737304688
Gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus	44.876853942871094
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landingplace their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the newcomers were and what were their intentions	83.80870819091797
They soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting	79.66166687011719
When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried Who comes there in Sardinian	62.87214660644531
Franz coolly cocked both barrels	111.72875213623047
Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him	131.56390380859375
Will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain	13.648512840270996
My name must rest unknown replied Franz merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for pleasure	83.5008773803711
As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks	20.73186683654785
Not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied Franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other	155.6732940673828
The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said Saccommodi	91.9657974243164
The Italian saccommodi is untranslatable it means at once Come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master	89.89124298095703
It is like that Turkish phrase of Molires that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance	70.41551208496094
The sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land Gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came Franz	161.29441833496094
One of his guns was swung over his shoulder Gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	44.83256912231445
The boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out	174.45858764648438
Not that way if you please	86.48941802978516
Gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way	81.35806274414062
They advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentryboxes	138.68679809570312
Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles	18.729291915893555
Franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of Monte Cristo	243.38746643066406
As for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	79.5174560546875
He mentioned this to Gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by	50.29094314575195
Besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice	89.26551055908203
You are a born diplomat returned Franz go and try	115.84565734863281
Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire	72.66844177246094
Franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air	247.09274291992188
Well said Franz anything newdo they refuse	31.547895431518555
On the contrary returned Gaetano the chief who was told you were a young Frenchman invites you to sup with him	6351.67919921875
Well observed Franz this chief is very polite and I see no objectionthe more so as I bring my share of the supper	37.35130310058594
Oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house	29.873502731323242
His house Has he built one here then	263.657958984375
No but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say	323.10394287109375
You know this chief then	118.01947784423828
I have heard talk of him	104.72722625732422
Favorably or otherwise	32.08537292480469
The deuceand what is this condition	138.3376007080078
That you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you	34.372135162353516
Franz looked at Gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	321.49261474609375
Ah replied he guessing Franzs thought I know this is a serious matter	166.3525848388672
What should you do in my place	112.95966339111328
I who have nothing to loseI should go	1.020900845527649
20075 m	158.303955078125
You would accept	99.9111099243164
Yes were it only out of curiosity	100.041015625
There is something very peculiar about this chief then	416.047119140625
Listen said Gaetano lowering his voice I do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was near	1497.158935546875
What do they say	108.4036865234375
That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is nothing	27.349075317382812
What nonsense said Franz reseating himself	249.072998046875
It is no nonsense it is quite true	152.94223022460938
Cama the pilot of the Saint Ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales	237.46434020996094
Do you know observed Franz that with such stories you make me think of Ali Babas enchanted cavern	84.77996063232422
I tell you what I have been told	125.39348602294922
Then you advise me to accept	107.22793579101562
Oh I do nt say that your excellency will do as you please I should be sorry to advise you in the matter	252.24461364746094
Franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted	130.25733947753906
Gaetano departed with the reply	100.60172271728516
Franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	104.79810333251953
He turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible	200.98855590820312
Never mind that returned the sailor I know their vessel	84.03304290771484
Is it a very beautiful vessel	236.1254119873047
I would not wish for a better to sail round the world	111.55482482910156
Of what burden is she	87.12407684326172
About a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	264.5382080078125
She is what the English call a yacht	153.91952514648438
Where was she built	1.0700074434280396
I know not but my own opinion is she is a Genoese	155.44741821289062
And how did a leader of smugglers continued Franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa	107.72407531738281
I did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor	816.5025024414062
No but Gaetano did I thought	243.994140625
Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone	70.51799774169922
And if this person be not a smuggler who is he	142.60760498046875
A wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure	114.88189697265625
Come thought Franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree	255.43385314941406
What is his name	41.88682174682617
If you ask him he says Sinbad the Sailor but I doubt if it be his real name	108.57279205322266
Sinbad the Sailor	350.2679443359375
And where does he reside	80.30139923095703
On the sea	30.347379684448242
What country does he come from	163.13674926757812
I do not know	120.92422485351562
Have you ever seen him	49.329776763916016
What sort of a man is he	221.94447326660156
Your excellency will judge for yourself	142.37550354003906
Where will he receive me	112.32923126220703
No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of	42.818843841552734
Have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace	68.41604614257812
Oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word	152.59767150878906
Decidedly muttered Franz this is an Arabian Nights adventure	1.0594191551208496
His excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel	92.1552963256836
He was accompanied by two of the yachts crew	104.55961608886719
Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him	158.36459350585938
Without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion	176.5157928466797
Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage	345.1509094238281
He promised	241.98008728027344
Then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel	66.6528091430664
After going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow Gaetano to goa refusal he could now comprehend	175.89102172851562
Presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed	142.2935791015625
At length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	153.5922393798828
There was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent French although with a foreign accent said	196.96258544921875
Welcome sir	142.75912475585938
I beg you will remove your bandage	122.3881607055664
It may be supposed then Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirtyeight to forty years of age dressed in a Tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle	182.07534790039062
Although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure Greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them	313.9211120605469
His pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	37.940467834472656
He was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the South had small hands and feet	82.37257385253906
But what astonished Franz who had treated Gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	42.58700942993164
The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold	29.813642501831055
In a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated	43.22883987426758
The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	95.91645050048828
Sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered I should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because I should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure	3256.087646484375
Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds	256.0903625488281
Ma foi my dear sir replied Franz make no apologies	143.32135009765625
I have always observed that they bandage peoples eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of Raoul in the Huguenots and really I have nothing to complain of for what I see makes me think of the wonders of the Arabian Nights	113.20915985107422
20079 m	96.97779083251953
Alas I may say with Lucullus if I could have anticipated the honor of your visit I would have prepared for it	51.67534637451172
But such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will	72.6533432006836
Ali is the supper ready	124.89473724365234
At this moment the tapestry moved aside and a Nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the diningroom	124.3576431274414
Now said the unknown to Franz I do not know if you are of my opinion but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another	81.15294647216797
Pray observe that I too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title	104.17259216308594
I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you	6.20837926864624
As for myself that I may put you at your ease I tell you that I am generally called Sinbad the Sailor	323.8730773925781
And I replied Franz will tell you as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin	1859.226806640625
That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good genius	47.01361083984375
Well then Signor Aladdin replied the singular Amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the diningroom your humble servant going first to show the way	138.09690856933594
At these words moving aside the tapestry Sinbad preceded his guest	1.105339765548706
Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him	230.05377197265625
The diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	43.38075637817383
These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were Sicily pineapples pomegranates from Malaga oranges from the Balearic Isles peaches from France and dates from Tunis	33.87892150878906
The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds a boars ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster	76.50605773925781
Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	70.66960906982422
The dishes were of silver and the plates of Japanese china	205.9490203857422
Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	70.8289794921875
Ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon	57.961509704589844
Yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it	60.14265060424805
He remembers that I saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders	310.775390625
Ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it	407.9930114746094
Would it be impertinent Signor Sinbad said Franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness	104.50792694091797
20081 m	238.34100341796875
Oh they are simple enough replied the host	90.78125762939453
It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the Bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third	88.25390625
I always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out I went to the Bey and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid doublebarreled gun which I knew he was very desirous of having	64.6472396850586
He hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devils punishment	236.2344207763672
But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I had shivered his highnesss yataghan to pieces the Bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis	225.98245239257812
This was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe	51.036102294921875
Franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief narrative	129.4752960205078
And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling	91.86253356933594
I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season	61.345706939697266
Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	92.25532531738281
You have suffered a great deal sir said Franz inquiringly	89.041015625
Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied What makes you suppose so	93.03215026855469
Everything answered Franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead	135.28025817871094
II live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	740.0181274414062
I am king of all creation	141.06996154785156
I am pleased with one place and stay there I get tired of it and leave it I am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish	47.84333801269531
Sometimes I amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law	112.13459777832031
Then I have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees	71.09452819824219
Ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there	170.39181518554688
Revenge for instance observed Franz	110.65303039550781
The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	198.73374938964844
And why revenge he asked	59.35096740722656
Because replied Franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it	72.42118072509766
Ah responded Sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth	46.5394287109375
You have not guessed rightly	176.26414489746094
Such as you see me I am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert and the man in the little blue cloak	60.63349151611328
And will that be the first time you ever took that journey	99.73519134521484
Yes it will	69.53985595703125
I must seem to you by no means curious but I assure you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so longit will happen one day or the other	38.06000518798828
20083 m	33.19979476928711
And do you propose to make this journey very shortly	38.43549346923828
I do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements	39.62747573852539
I should like to be there at the time you come and I will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at Monte Cristo	179.4016571044922
I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if I go there it will be in all probability incognito	63.25672912597656
The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice	68.02458190917969
Then Ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	318.1618957519531
Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover	111.76177978515625
The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franzs curiosity	107.78172302246094
He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him	53.29165267944336
He replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment	1.0302103757858276
You can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you	91.89315795898438
No I really can not	107.95903015136719
Well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter	54.61619186401367
But replied Franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth I do not feel any particular desire	77.38784790039062
Ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried Sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	153.79244995117188
Are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god taste this and the mines of Peru Guzerat and Golconda are opened to you	73.81707000732422
Are you a man of imaginationa poet taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie	99.41459655761719
Are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France Spain or England but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the feet of Satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth	78.7827377319336
Is it not tempting what I offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus look	13.776676177978516
At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	38.84124755859375
Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired	178.89141845703125
What then is this precious stuff	72.34452819824219
Did you ever hear he replied of the Old Man of the Mountain who attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste	108.50965118408203
Of course I have	52.108924865722656
Well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	53.719566345214844
In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by HassenbenSabah and in these gardens isolated pavilions	55.77336883544922
Into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says Marco Polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to Paradise in the midst of everblooming shrubs everripe fruit and everlovely virgins	63.513572692871094
What these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste	89.16150665283203
Then cried Franz it is hashish I know thatby name at least	59.837860107421875
That is it precisely Signor Aladdin it is hashishthe purest and most unadulterated hashish of Alexandriathe hashish of AbouGor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words A grateful world to the dealer in happiness	335.1044006347656
Do you know said Franz I have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies	38.788421630859375
Judge for yourself Signor Aladdinjudge but do not confine yourself to one trial	371.6641540527344
Like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous	78.0325698852539
There is a struggle in nature against this divine substancein nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain	61.328739166259766
Nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream	210.0917205810547
But what changes occur It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	43.801856994628906
When you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a Lapland winterto quit paradise for earthheaven for hell Taste the hashish guest of minetaste the hashish	170.50941467285156
Franzs only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth	79.28313446044922
Diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	240.699462890625
I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say	264.4378356933594
Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors	156.40513610839844
Tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants with assaftida and the Chinese eat swallows nests Eh no Well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	163.92767333984375
Let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes	143.48716735839844
They both arose and while he who called himself Sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant Franz entered still another apartment	123.46569061279297
It was simply yet richly furnished	27.288850784301758
It was round and a large divan completely encircled it	41.615211486816406
Divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavymaned lionskins from Atlas striped tigerskins from Bengal pantherskins from the Cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to Dante bearskins from Siberia foxskins from Norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed	10.60769271850586
Both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice	42.318992614746094
Each of them took one which Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee	148.71897888183594
There was a moments silence during which Sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	114.1552505493164
Ali brought in the coffee	163.84312438964844
How do you take it inquired the unknown in the French or Turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling As you please it is ready in all ways	15.043014526367188
I will take it in the Turkish style replied Franz	319.5064697265625
And you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an Oriental life	78.36988067626953
Ah those Orientals they are the only men who know how to live	45.351688385009766
As for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when I have completed my affairs in Paris I shall go and die in the East and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at Cairo Bagdad or Ispahan	70.92276000976562
20087 m	58.18281555175781
Ma foi said Franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for I feel eagles wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in fourandtwenty hours	72.66722869873047
Ah yes the hashish is beginning its work	394.01629638671875
Well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of Icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall	81.42268371582031
He then said something in Arabic to Ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance	116.17425537109375
As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him	53.19887161254883
All the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	152.76315307617188
His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailorssongs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken downhe saw the Island of Monte Cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or Amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city	118.49942016601562
At length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lips touch lips and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody	86.01778411865234
He descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind adreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from Sinbad his singular host to Ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure	68.12443542480469
They were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair	78.77661895751953
They were Phryne Cleopatra Messalina those three celebrated courtesans	133.6862335205078
Then among them glided like a pure ray like a Christian angel in the midst of Olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons	110.13326263427734
Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss	145.43026733398438
It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect	266.91387939453125
Lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to Franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpentlike embraces	40.090877532958984
The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream	96.75588989257812
Chapter 32	66.56737518310547
The Waking	146.07106018066406
When Franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	34.02969741821289
He thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	229.61122131347656
He stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous	274.38507080078125
The vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking	111.88917541503906
He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality	34.23006820678711
He found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky	15.321011543273926
The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water	72.18450164794922
There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver	28.666873931884766
He was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory	54.9958610534668
He recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish	51.80782699584961
It seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination	108.32111358642578
Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	116.57512664794922
Otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever	188.5465850830078
He went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said	94.24376678466797
The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to Malaga	104.29784393310547
So then Gaetano said Franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while I was asleep	332.469970703125
He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew	215.34954833984375
So saying Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of Corsica	514.6577758789062
Franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	132.2581329345703
Gaetano was not mistaken	488.6728820800781
At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spyglass in his hand	66.78369140625
He was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	53.69303512573242
Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	179.9377899169922
After a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then Franz heard a slight report	101.99645233154297
There do you hear observed Gaetano he is bidding you adieu	159.69268798828125
The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore	87.59032440185547
What are your excellencys orders inquired Gaetano	63.15407943725586
In the first place light me a torch	144.1073760986328
Ah yes I understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment	86.79678344726562
With much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and I will get you the torch you ask for	320.1665344238281
But I too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but I have always given it up	111.98423767089844
Giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency	166.65985107421875
Giovanni obeyed	62.34028625488281
Franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by Gaetano	146.46470642089844
He recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	31.647705078125
He saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	146.3613739013672
Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way	90.58515930175781
All was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless	31.401735305786133
At the end of this time he gave up his search and Gaetano smiled	50.541114807128906
When Franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon	29.397186279296875
He looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything	91.13287353515625
Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	69.41736602783203
He took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	50.74165344238281
These animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and Franz could not consider them as game	1.0545612573623657
Moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	201.79388427734375
Since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the Thousand and One Nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto	91.2400131225586
Then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids	39.0703010559082
The second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready	99.18372344970703
Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards Corsica	80.94001007080078
Why he remarked to Gaetano you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga while it seems he is in the direction of PortoVecchio	962.3255615234375
Do nt you remember said the patron I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands	65.43863677978516
True and he is going to land them added Franz	89.7100601196289
Precisely so replied Gaetano	76.1031723022461
Ah he is one who fears neither God nor Satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service	89.23823547363281
20093 m	25.600976943969727
But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said Franz	1193.726318359375
And what cares he for that replied Gaetano with a laugh or any authorities He smiles at them	94.83573913574219
Let them try to pursue him Why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere	126.92585754394531
It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad Franzs host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the Mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	57.105037689208984
As to Franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo	161.9707489013672
He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way	144.507568359375
At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of PortoVecchio	87.07349395751953
With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper Sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for Franz	65.2601089477539
The boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of Monte Cristo	66.09867858886719
When Franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at Rome	136.57154846191406
He set out and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mailcoach	32.5208854675293
An apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrinis hotel	152.7675323486328
But this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at Rome there are four great events in every yearthe Carnival Holy Week Corpus Christi and the Feast of St	54.78226089477539
All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the nexta sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which Franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	170.84188842773438
At last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel	41.62263488769531
On his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the Htel de Londres	22.52777862548828
Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini and asked for Albert de Morcerf	73.0127182006836
This plan succeeded and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to Albert when Morcerf himself appeared	36.015403747558594
The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	57.285064697265625
The two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage	56.914581298828125
The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged	185.1663055419922
Very good signor Pastrini said Franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days	157.2230224609375
As to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage	65.0988998413086
What as to the carriage exclaimed Albert	79.8227767944336
Come come Signor Pastrini no joking we must have a carriage	28.01810646057129
Sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all I can say	76.7352066040039
And when shall we know inquired Franz	54.96744155883789
Tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper	67.8881607055664
Oh the deuce then we shall pay the more that s all I see plainly enough	188.93060302734375
At Drakes or Aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirtyfive lire a day more for Sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it	27.584665298461914
I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage	40.603153228759766
Then they must put horses to mine	1860.063720703125
It is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter	89.2768783569336
There are no horses	119.5156478881836
Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	142.63705444335938
Do you understand that my dear Franzno horses he said but ca nt we have posthorses	46.899085998535156
They have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting	46.439937591552734
What are we to say to this asked Franz	65.9309310913086
I say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another	123.67964935302734
Is supper ready Signor Pastrini	28.379907608032227
Yes your excellency	59.65515899658203
Well then let us sup	53.74964904785156
But the carriage and horses said Franz	311.5549621582031
Be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them	119.06031799316406
Morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or welllined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six horses	237.25732421875
Chapter 33	92.52379608154297
Roman Bandits	229.19937133789062
The next morning Franz woke first and instantly rang the bell	54.698787689208984
The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered	112.2108154296875
Well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for Franz to question him I feared yesterday when I would not promise you anything that you were too latethere is not a single carriage to be hadthat is for the three last days	78.98722076416016
Yes returned Franz for the very three days it is most needed	63.74811553955078
What is the matter said Albert entering no carriage to be had	168.12098693847656
Just so returned Franz you have guessed it	151.2845001220703
Well your Eternal City is a nice sort of place	130.07945251464844
That is to say excellency replied Pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday to Tuesday evening but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you please	172.45602416992188
Ah that is something said Albert today is Thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday	73.1248779296875
Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied Franz which will make it still more difficult	71.67079162597656
My friend said Morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future	175.57595825195312
At least we can have a window	74.90279388427734
In the Corso	85.30693054199219
Ah a window exclaimed Signor Pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day	106.36766052246094
The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction	105.13245391845703
Well said Franz to Albert do you know what is the best thing we can do It is to pass the Carnival at Venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages	181.03025817871094
Ah the devil no cried Albert I came to Rome to see the Carnival and I will though I see it on stilts	1.0845603942871094
Bravo an excellent idea	41.906803131103516
We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes and we shall have complete success	71.37789154052734
Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning	82.96623229980469
Parbleu said Albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome like lawyers clerks	45.538089752197266
I hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes only I tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day	32.38372802734375
And as I am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said Franz I warn you that as I have been four times before at Rome I know the prices of all the carriages we will give you twelve piastres for today tomorrow and the day after and then you will make a good profit	144.203125
But excellencysaid Pastrini still striving to gain his point	26.624223709106445
Now go returned Franz or I shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one I offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault	94.63179016113281
Do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned Signor Pastrini with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat I will do all I can and I hope you will be satisfied	44.604366302490234
And now we understand each other	112.25116729736328
When do you wish the carriage to be here	53.26800537109375
In an hour	20.800077438354492
In an hour it will be at the door	288.50872802734375
An hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival	155.7877960205078
Excellency cried the cicerone seeing Franz approach the window shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace	62.0191535949707
Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	84.75691986083984
Franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the Htel de Londres was the palace	72.96653747558594
The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase	41.75981903076172
Franz and Albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind	28.14103889465332
Where do your excellencies wish to go asked he	230.08108520507812
To Saint Peters first and then to the Colosseum returned Albert	61.49938201904297
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peters and a month to study it	195.66722106933594
The day was passed at Saint Peters alone	169.42906188964844
Suddenly the daylight began to fade away Franz took out his watchit was halfpast four	66.55635833740234
They returned to the hotel at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight	46.56586837768555
He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him Saint Peters by daylight	89.79167938232422
When we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been	181.4558868408203
He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni thus they would behold the Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the Capitol the Forum the Arch of Septimus Severus the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Via Sacra	6.8709869384765625
They sat down to dinner	64.77300262451172
Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	90.0742416381836
At the end of the dinner he entered in person	44.69082260131836
Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	33.84661865234375
Excellency said Pastrini I am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that I came	285.414794921875
Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked Albert lighting his cigar	448.7170104980469
No and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at Rome things can or can not be done when you are told anything can not be done there is an end of it	53.20603561401367
It is much more convenient at Pariswhen anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly	66.62989807128906
That is what all the French say returned Signor Pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason I do not understand why they travel	51.71589660644531
But said Albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel	63.15724182128906
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder their walk on the Boulevard de Gand and the Caf de Paris	38.227073669433594
It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters	39.93896484375
Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	38.49951934814453
But said Franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may I beg to know what it was	81.27574157714844
20099 m	76.08785247802734
Ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely	66.87349700927734
I have	121.56340789794922
You intend visiting Il Colosseo	27.61334228515625
You mean the Colosseum	475.5657043457031
It is the same thing	135.05068969726562
You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni	141.03585815429688
These are my words exactly	154.91073608398438
Well this route is impossible	1.2193939685821533
Very dangerous to say the least	50.208229064941406
Dangerousand why	84.04297637939453
On account of the famous Luigi Vampa	106.18077850341797
Pray who may this famous Luigi Vampa be inquired Albert he may be very famous at Rome but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris	41.98283386230469
What do you not know him	303.5126037597656
I have not that honor	162.5125732421875
You have never heard his name	52.30101013183594
Well then he is a bandit compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere children	213.3609161376953
Now then Albert cried Franz here is a bandit for you at last	114.1262435913086
I forewarn you Signor Pastrini that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin	189.04541015625
Once upon a time Well go on	179.2964630126953
Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many Frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	62.386348724365234
Excellency said he gravely addressing Franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest I	92.63936614990234
Albert does not say you are a liar Signor Pastrini said Franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut I will believe all you say so proceed	143.02928161621094
But if your excellency doubt my veracity	46.9831428527832
Signor Pastrini returned Franz you are more susceptible than Cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	20.689733505249023
Come sit down and tell us all about this Signor Vampa	71.72775268554688
I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastrilla	60.99574279785156
Well what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo and to reenter by the Porta San Giovanni	76.2203598022461
20101 m	31.437040328979492
This replied Signor Pastrini that you will go out by one but I very much doubt your returning by the other	1.1253187656402588
Why asked Franz	420.0746765136719
Because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates	37.25234603881836
On your honor is that true cried Albert	119.72109985351562
Count returned Signor Pastrini hurt at Alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions I do not say this to you but to your companion who knows Rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at	94.45831298828125
My dear fellow said Albert turning to Franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and doublebarrelled guns	230.48770141601562
Luigi Vampa comes to take us and we take himwe bring him back to Rome and present him to his holiness the Pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the Carnival in the carriage and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol and proclaim us like Curtius and Horatius Cocles the preservers of their country	80.39039611816406
Whilst Albert proposed this scheme Signor Pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to describe	84.90925598144531
And pray asked Franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage	153.47964477539062
Not out of my armory for at Terracina I was plundered even of my huntingknife	51.82379913330078
And you	36.20900344848633
I shared the same fate at Aquapendente	161.7509307861328
Do you know Signor Pastrini said Albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own	81.83309173583984
Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to Franz as the only one likely to listen with attention	210.528564453125
Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits	137.66244506835938
What cried Albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance	68.07449340820312
No for it would be useless	85.7192153930664
What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you	165.5360565185547
Eh parbleuthey should kill me	38.89109802246094
The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say Your friend is decidedly mad	141.23863220214844
My dear Albert returned Franz your answer is sublime and worthy the Let him die of Corneille only when Horace made that answer the safety of Rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive	68.09526824951172
Albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma Christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words	191.7548065185547
Well Signor Pastrini said Franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this Luigi Vampa	466.05108642578125
Is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short Describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like Jean Sbogar or Lara we may recognize him	186.37606811523438
You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for I knew him when he was a child and one day that I fell into his hands going from Ferentino to Alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me	67.48127746582031
Let us see the watch said Albert	104.88199615478516
Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Brguet bearing the name of its maker of Parisian manufacture and a counts coronet	302.7036437988281
Here it is said he	220.00326538085938
Peste returned Albert I compliment you on it I have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 francs	129.96165466308594
Let us hear the history said Franz motioning Signor Pastrini to seat himself	64.61454010009766
Your excellencies permit it asked the host	1.055194616317749
Pardieu cried Albert you are not a preacher to remain standing	122.40514373779297
The host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi Vampa	112.75016784667969
You tell me said Franz at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a childhe is still a young man then	167.31851196289062
A young man he is only twoandtwentyhe will gain himself a reputation	43.65076446533203
What do you think of that Albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous	248.3730010986328
Yes and at his age Alexander Csar and Napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him	65.93866729736328
So continued Franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty	94.20269775390625
Scarcely so much	88.24691772460938
Is he tall or short	59.2491455078125
Of the middle heightabout the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to Albert	72.03087615966797
Thanks for the comparison said Albert with a bow	41.63357162475586
Go on Signor Pastrini continued Franz smiling at his friends susceptibility	67.21803283691406
To what class of society does he belong	99.31822204589844
He was a shepherdboy attached to the farm of the Count of SanFelice situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri he was born at Pampinara and entered the counts service when he was five years old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at Rome	75.13226318359375
When quite a child the little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity	111.39154052734375
One day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of Palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called Borgo he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it	41.79560470581055
The child accepted joyfully	88.19719696044922
Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from Palestrina to Borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary	158.340576171875
At the end of three months he had learned to read	101.21978759765625
This was not enoughhe must now learn to write	157.3795623779297
The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three alphabetsone large one middling and one small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write	361.7535095214844
The same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus	188.58740234375
The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began	52.54551315307617
At the end of three months he had learned to write	84.32119750976562
The curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	213.95884704589844
This demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus	9.762139320373535
The curate related the incident to the Count of SanFelice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month	148.34141540527344
With this Luigi purchased books and pencils	53.572349548339844
He applied his imitative powers to everything and like Giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees	32.7076301574707
Then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that Pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	65.4115219116211
20105 m	281.8558044433594
A girl of six or seventhat is a little younger than Vampatended sheep on a farm near Palestrina she was an orphan born at Valmontone and was named Teresa	90.25563049316406
The two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the Count of SanFelices flock from those of Baron Cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning	93.2790756225586
The next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together	73.6307144165039
Vampa was twelve and Teresa eleven	44.741912841796875
And yet their natural disposition revealed itself	75.06436920166016
Beside his taste for the fine arts which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	187.80300903320312
None of the lads of Pampinara Palestrina or Valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion	1398.18115234375
His disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships	53.21744155883789
Teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended	56.23664855957031
Teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess	237.19985961914062
The two piastres that Luigi received every month from the Count of SanFelices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome were expended in earrings necklaces and gold hairpins	106.06686401367188
So that thanks to her friends generosity Teresa was the most beautiful and the bestattired peasant near Rome	101.57312774658203
The two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters	84.6402816772461
Thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province	68.03843688964844
Teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics	72.40287780761719
Then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position	107.34468078613281
One day the young shepherd told the counts steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the Sabine mountains and prowl around his flock	46.76641082763672
The steward gave him a gun this was what Vampa longed for	62.47428894042969
This gun had an excellent barrel made at Brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an English rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside	162.88327026367188
This however was nothing to a sculptor like Vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	66.16997528076172
But nothing could be farther from his thoughts	124.6125259399414
For a long time a gun had been the young mans greatest ambition	118.9884033203125
In every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared	404.1350402832031
From this moment Vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a markthe trunk of some old and mossgrown olivetree that grew on the Sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand	342.5741882324219
20107 m	63.7744140625
One evening a wolf emerged from a pinewood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead	139.5853729248047
Proud of this exploit Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm	96.7020263671875
These exploits had gained Luigi considerable reputation	459.4057312011719
The man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will	41.90637969970703
He was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa	110.082763671875
And yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	199.26522827148438
Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a days separation	86.9098892211914
Teresa was sixteen and Vampa seventeen	120.5960693359375
About this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be much spoken of	168.3788299560547
The brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of Rome	119.33238983154297
Sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers	35.479156494140625
The celebrated Cucumetto pursued in the Abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of Naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the Garigliano like Manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno	82.64419555664062
He strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone whom he hoped to surpass	44.703590393066406
Many young men of Palestrina Frascati and Pampinara had disappeared	101.31767272949219
Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto	127.1490249633789
After some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him	1.1888821125030518
One day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of Frosinone	57.0553092956543
The bandits laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings	169.55247497558594
When their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost	289.9472961425781
The young girls lover was in Cucumettos troop his name was Carlini	86.52216339111328
When she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe but Carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her	118.05353546142578
However as he was a favorite with Cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	77.73838806152344
He took Cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	80.36241912841797
There he told the chief allhis affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins	320.3409423828125
20109 m	43.67697525024414
It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting	141.26551818847656
Cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	277.86273193359375
Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in Ritas favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom	51.050987243652344
Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to Ritas father at Frosinone	88.80950164794922
Carlini flew joyfully to Rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres	145.9508819580078
Twelve hours delay was all that was grantedthat is until nine the next morning	78.22610473632812
The instant the letter was written Carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger	369.0990905761719
He found a young shepherd watching his flock	76.597900390625
The natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life	113.54937744140625
The boy undertook the commission promising to be in Frosinone in less than an hour	64.9952392578125
Carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence	138.2264862060547
He found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them	76.9880599975586
He inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter	38.20756149291992
A cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end	130.25379943847656
He repeated his question	149.88853454589844
One of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with Orvietto saying To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair Rita	137.0694122314453
At this moment Carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came	87.60177612304688
After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto	140.3624725341797
At the sight of Carlini Cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand	351.8461608886719
The two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	49.3580436706543
A terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees Carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	89.2027587890625
Rita lay between them	98.91285705566406
The moon lighted the group	25.040260314941406
Well said Cucumetto have you executed your commission	153.80859375
Yes captain returned Carlini	104.42861938476562
At nine oclock tomorrow Ritas father will be here with the money	53.05729675292969
It is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste	9.30868148803711
Now as I am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her	81.85225677490234
You have determined then to abandon her to the common law said Carlini	67.890625
Why should an exception be made in her favor	58.824180603027344
I thought that my entreaties	82.58306121826172
What right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception	45.841983795166016
It is true	96.4556884765625
But never mind continued Cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come	23.06456184387207
Carlinis teeth clenched convulsively	130.22119140625
Now then said Cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming	131.15277099609375
I follow you	651.9224853515625
20111 m	191.15036010742188
Cucumetto departed without losing sight of Carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on Carlinis part	149.11813354492188
He was standing his arms folded near Rita who was still insensible	208.79640197753906
Cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now Rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it	15.869950294494629
He continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself	20.24740982055664
Let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief	428.1773376464844
Their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence	40.05483627319336
The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons	1.2468899488449097
The names of all including Carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio	82.60247802734375
He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face	177.6920928955078
A large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely	56.94169998168945
Diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh	94.25535583496094
Captain said he just now Carlini would not drink your health when I proposed it to him propose mine to him and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me	149.26040649414062
Everyone expected an explosion on Carlinis part but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it	131.89248657226562
Your health Diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least	134.00123596191406
Then sitting down by the fire My supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite	671.9220581054688
Well done Carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while Diavolaccio disappeared	94.21441650390625
Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened	42.50402069091797
The bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	31.605539321899414
They turned round and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms	403.0625
Her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground	212.0688934326172
As they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio	50.06355667114258
This apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of Carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly	136.48880004882812
Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid Rita at the captains feet	194.02365112304688
Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit	212.8882598876953
A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Ritas left breast	45.95997619628906
Everyone looked at Carlini the sheath at his belt was empty	53.912384033203125
Ah ah said the chief I now understand why Carlini stayed behind	325.3180847167969
All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	226.0526123046875
No other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what Carlini had done	135.10671997070312
Now then cried Carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me	115.47306823730469
No returned the chief she is thine	62.37820053100586
Carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight	120.4168930053711
Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire	709.8142700195312
At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	46.169944763183594
It was Ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in person	123.76820373535156
Here said he to Cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child	38.08194351196289
But the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow	107.29923248291016
The old man obeyed	77.64984893798828
They both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight	49.526283264160156
Cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	90.34088134765625
There said he demand thy child of Carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions	128.7613525390625
The old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	182.2527313232422
At length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend	105.270751953125
As he approached Carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	50.27722930908203
A woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became visible	140.27374267578125
The old man recognized his child and Carlini recognized the old man	88.54508972167969
I expected thee said the bandit to Ritas father	52.9556999206543
Wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on Rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom	37.470314025878906
A ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead	1478.310302734375
Cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit I loved her therefore I slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole band	83.49872589111328
The old man spoke not and grew pale as death	351.65142822265625
Now continued Carlini if I have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	79.60877227783203
Thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son	139.2466583251953
20115 m	476.9537048339844
Carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss father	407.6068115234375
These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept	120.92809295654297
Now said the old man aid me to bury my child	77.57186889648438
Carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose	645.3817138671875
When the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave	114.10077667236328
Then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	5.249363422393799
Then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled	176.24440002441406
Then extending his hand the old man said I thank you my son and now leave me alone	269.3602600097656
Yet replied Carlini	34.59080505371094
Leave me I command you	128.624755859375
Carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest	160.05311584472656
It had been resolved the night before to change their encampment	94.21549987792969
An hour before daybreak Cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march	104.68463134765625
But Carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of Ritas father	237.69520568847656
He went toward the place where he had left him	66.16063690185547
He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters grave	1.0623751878738403
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other	145.00550842285156
But he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the Roman carbineers Carlini was killed	89.1120376586914
There was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders	130.5745086669922
That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlinis rear when he fell	28.4737491607666
On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it	298.8861389160156
They told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	42.298030853271484
Thus from Fondi to Perusia everyone trembles at the name of Cucumetto	76.37425231933594
These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between Luigi and Teresa	57.464698791503906
The young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but Vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowlingpiece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree	131.4844512939453
Time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age	432.7003479003906
They were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	61.85082244873047
One day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	215.50466918945312
When he came within hearing he exclaimed	99.35829162597656
I am pursued can you conceal me	459.1269836425781
They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former	146.9095001220703
Vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by Teresa	118.57595825195312
Instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck	95.31135559082031
The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them	213.1558074951172
They had seen no one	21.308317184448242
That is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief	85.72676849365234
Cucumetto cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment	87.067138671875
Yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him	84.51280212402344
The two young persons exchanged looks	95.08963775634766
The brigadier had a moments hope	51.22731399536133
Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married	170.7188262939453
Yes it is very annoying said Vampa but we have not seen him	52.15501022338867
Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	61.32160568237305
Vampa then removed the stone and Cucumetto came out	216.2286834716797
Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley	73.5931625366211
He had read in the countenances of Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them	341.5252685546875
But Vampa raised his head proudly as to Teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	4.629002094268799
Cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from Teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of Eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors	27.973726272583008
Several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto	282.17315673828125
The time of the Carnival was at hand	115.4350814819336
The Count of SanFelice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in Rome were invited	45.25299835205078
Teresa had a great desire to see this ball	50.68678283691406
Luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	48.7161979675293
This was granted	201.13177490234375
The ball was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter Carmela whom he adored	100.8601303100586
Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela	171.43899536132812
On the evening of the ball Teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beadsshe was in the costume of the women of Frascati	147.12393188476562
Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time	36.79277038574219
They both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants	144.1156768798828
The festa was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the gardenwalks	46.15336990356445
At each crosspath was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased	50.7445182800293
Carmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino	21.723127365112305
Her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of Turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of Indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels	70.74185943603516
Two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of Nettuno and the other as a woman of La Riccia	366.7615051269531
Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world	554.96044921875
They were attired as peasants of Albano Velletri CivitaCastellana and Sora	123.321533203125
We need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	218.15675354003906
Carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	108.5667953491211
Carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions	144.86660766601562
The Count of SanFelice pointed out Teresa who was hanging on Luigis arm in a group of peasants	55.66515350341797
Will you allow me father said Carmela	90.8408432006836
Certainly replied the count are we not in Carnival time	305.7587585449219
Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to Teresa	168.0579833984375
The young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to Teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts daughter	139.92376708984375
Teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at Luigi who could not refuse his assent	134.33358764648438
Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and Teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille	62.444091796875
Certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very different character from that of Carmela and her companions and Teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waistgirdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain	71.13916015625
Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind	33.51814270019531
It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body	99.65741729736328
He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	51.08015441894531
When they spoke although Teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the goodlooking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination	74.55703735351562
Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time	1639.3798828125
Luigi was jealous	6.022733211517334
He felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition Teresa might escape him	2048.2001953125
The young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	59.912174224853516
We have said that Teresa was handsome but this is not all Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies	75.7078857421875
She had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the Count of SanFelices daughter we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not jealous of her	222.9872283935547
And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where Luigi awaited her	35.37702178955078
Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at Luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	147.46014404296875
Thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers arm	333.11614990234375
The quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition Carmela alone objecting to it but the Count of SanFelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded	23.04194450378418
One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared	78.67301177978516
The truth was that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed Teresa toward another part of the garden	58.19602584838867
Teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him	81.5541000366211
She herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her	34.85515594482422
Why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	8579.171875
However to Teresas great astonishment Luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening	138.85638427734375
When the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa indoors he took Teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said	46.047855377197266
Teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young Countess of SanFelice	398.8818054199219
I thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that I would give half my life for a costume such as she wore	372.8020935058594
And what said your cavalier to you	97.38822174072266
He said it only depended on myself to have it and I had only one word to say	731.2317504882812
He was right said Luigi	168.12057495117188
Do you desire it as ardently as you say	703.7009887695312
Well then you shall have it	165.13485717773438
The young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips	130.1621551513672
As Luigi spoke thus he left her	220.55441284179688
Teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh	53.77916717529297
20121 m	161.7412109375
That night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	176.57431030273438
The Villa of SanFelice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carmela	144.38909912109375
Awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames	164.60952758789062
She then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grassplot where she fainted	109.3368148803711
When she recovered her father was by her side	291.9655456542969
All the servants surrounded her offering her assistance	340.51708984375
An entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured	78.02571868896484
Her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	91.29045867919922
Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him	99.79602813720703
As the count was immensely rich excepting the danger Carmela had runand the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortunethe loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle	50.630714416503906
The next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	50.47498321533203
Luigi arrived first	93.98719024658203
He came toward Teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening	67.23877716064453
The young girl was very pensive but seeing Luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion	405.6548767089844
Luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	25.26125144958496
Then he paused	183.999755859375
The young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly	10.349617958068848
Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter	206.91525268554688
Yes replied Teresa with astonishment but I was mad to utter such a wish	261.30120849609375
And I replied Very well you shall have it	43.59367752075195
Yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi but of course your reply was only to please me	179.67312622070312
I have promised no more than I have given you Teresa said Luigi proudly	100.04159545898438
Go into the grotto and dress yourself	24.454111099243164
At these words he drew away the stone and showed Teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by Luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume	59.707550048828125
Teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking Luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressingroom	269.8619079589844
Luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes	67.55339050292969
When he saw Luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him	36.50822448730469
Luigi was not mistaken	48.025516510009766
The traveller who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged Luigi to be his guide	76.5445556640625
Luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	40.67510223388672
In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the crossroads	153.20652770996094
On arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow	50.2740364074707
That is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake	69.818115234375
And here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money	56.09574890136719
Thank you said Luigi drawing back his hand I render a service I do not sell it	27.814289093017578
Well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift	130.3224639892578
Ah yes that is another thing	46.527523040771484
Then said the traveller take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings	840.3729248046875
And then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between Albano and CivitaCastellana	94.32243347167969
I accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins	124.30973815917969
For a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre	36.732757568359375
What is your name inquired the traveller	56.74459457397461
Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied Alexander King of Macedon	109.0755615234375
And yours	48.31465148925781
I said the traveller am called Sinbad the Sailor	80.02900695800781
Franz dpinay started with surprise	31.51878547668457
Sinbad the Sailor he said	62.04909133911133
Yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his own	56.785301208496094
Well and what may you have to say against this name inquired Albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth I must confess	123.14037322998047
Franz said no more	75.54751586914062
The name of Sinbad the Sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening	181.90672302246094
Proceed said he to the host	571.169677734375
Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	92.34806060791016
As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	59.47428512573242
He listened to know whence this sound could proceed	105.79092407226562
A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	109.1611099243164
The cry proceeded from the grotto	44.25103759765625
He bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller	163.71575927734375
Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear	132.61898803710938
He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa as Nessus the centaur carried Deianira	418.6329040527344
This man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	179.69857788085938
Vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	247.95599365234375
The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired	32.86698913574219
The ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with Teresa in his arms	79.80899810791016
The young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death	378.8927001953125
Vampa then rushed towards Teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed	95.1491928100586
Fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome Teresa	89.02471160888672
When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man	42.92271041870117
He had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death	136.7789306640625
His eyes remained open and menacing	88.60675811767578
Vampa approached the corpse and recognized Cucumetto	109.45878601074219
From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of Teresa and had sworn she should be his	38.46949005126953
From that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart	104.97691345214844
Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary Teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover	95.46577453613281
Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress	113.14812469482422
Ah said hegood good You are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself	266.8128356933594
20125 m	368.756591796875
Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of SanFelices daughter	47.299137115478516
Vampa took Cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn Teresa remained outside	458.7162170410156
If a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thinga shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with earrings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies	50.696956634521484
He would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of Florian and would have declared on reaching Paris that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill	91.86467742919922
At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa	110.47941589355469
He wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a Roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridgebox worked with gold and red and green silk skyblue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	84.88318634033203
Teresa uttered a cry of admiration	34.49898147583008
Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Lopold Robert or Schnetz	45.28611373901367
He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumetto	86.61900329589844
The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips	1.0330857038497925
Now he said to Teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be	20.774930953979492
Oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically	69.71492004394531
And follow me wherever I go	68.46757507324219
To the worlds end	63.89376449584961
Then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose	45.99867630004883
The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god	269.610595703125
They went towards the forest and soon entered it	315.2796325683594
We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to Vampa he therefore went forward without a moments hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half	184.77249145507812
At the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest	66.16969299316406
A torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	351.0057678222656
Vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks	296.72796630859375
Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion	47.589752197265625
Suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa	128.94007873535156
Not another step he said or you are a dead man	44.17450714111328
What then said Vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while Teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other	36.19187927246094
Who are you inquired the sentinel	117.7776870727539
I am Luigi Vampa shepherd of the SanFelice farm	49.0777702331543
What do you want	104.60973358154297
I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca Bianca	137.8645782470703
Follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first	59.99433898925781
Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before Teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before	61.1318359375
At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop	1.0691627264022827
The two young persons obeyed	1090.7947998046875
Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal	39.19478988647461
Good said the sentry you may now go on	38.655059814453125
Luigi and Teresa again set forward as they went on Teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees	50.1651496887207
The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcanoan extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome	46.94662094116211
Teresa and Luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	58.68012619018555
Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel	91.77742004394531
What has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefs absence	93.38019561767578
I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherds life was Vampas reply	34.92855453491211
Ah I understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks	76.19347381591797
Welcome cried several bandits from Ferrusino Pampinara and Anagni who had recognized Luigi Vampa	237.69520568847656
Yes but I came to ask something more than to be your companion	67.48358917236328
And what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment	123.7905044555664
I come to ask to be your captain said the young man	73.18495178222656
The bandits shouted with laughter	45.35359191894531
And what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant	50.47587203979492
I have killed your chief Cucumetto whose dress I now wear and I set fire to the villa SanFelice to procure a weddingdress for my betrothed	60.497093200683594
An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain vice Cucumetto deceased	131.023681640625
20129 m	72.12435913085938
Well my dear Albert said Franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa	43.8930549621582
I say he is a myth replied Albert and never had an existence	223.37757873535156
And what may a myth be inquired Pastrini	13.7198486328125
The explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied Franz	643.3215942382812
And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome	34.968055725097656
And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example	31.624557495117188
Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him	42.060298919677734
Why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the coast	55.970947265625
They seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at Giglio Giannutri or Monte Cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at Albano Tivoli or La Riccia	136.38601684570312
And how does he behave towards travellers	157.3643341064453
Alas his plan is very simple	82.80873107910156
It depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours grace	103.01163482666016
At the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account	85.16837310791016
Well Albert inquired Franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall	36.5510368347168
Quite so said Albert if the way be picturesque	35.95227813720703
The clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared	62.931053161621094
Excellencies said he the coach is ready	116.89708709716797
Well then said Franz let us to the Colosseum	142.79507446289062
By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets your excellencies	80.72366333007812
By the streets morbleu by the streets cried Franz	44.1285514831543
Ah my dear fellow said Albert rising and lighting his third cigar really I thought you had more courage	44.04927062988281
So saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage	153.04078674316406
20131 m	551.2372436523438
Chapter 34	53.1171875
The Colosseum	81.63074493408203
Franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	102.70269012451172
The road selected was a continuation of the Via Sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum	89.56170654296875
This itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up	74.8519515991211
Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	4.839130878448486
One fact more than the rest brought his friend Sinbad the Sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and Pastrinis account of Vampas having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at PortoVecchio for the sole purpose of landing them	113.82868957519531
The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Htel de Londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino Civita Vecchia Ostia and Gata as on those of Corsica Tuscany and Spain and further Franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of Tunis and Palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended	15.4701566696167
But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead	84.5519027709961
The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance	316.8968811035156
The usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at Rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monumentnay almost to each part of a monument	1111.857421875
It may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum that wonder of all ages which Martial thus eulogizes	49.09725570678711
Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Csars and the many voices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument	93.87567138671875
As for Albert and Franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	64.35990142822266
Thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	443.3271179199219
Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime	593.8893432617188
Scarcely therefore had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning Albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the Lions Den the Hall of the Gladiators and finishing with Csars Podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded Franz ascended a halfdilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin	90.05508422851562
Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a restingplace and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui	266.49151611328125
All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended	77.7332763671875
There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat	59.48849868774414
Conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness	215.72467041015625
The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like Franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides	121.13550567626953
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person	277.8072204589844
By a sort of instinctive impulse Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	85.46490478515625
About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars	111.59132385253906
Around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings	104.70809936523438
The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	93.26738739013672
He wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	47.83756637573242
The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth	61.26043701171875
20135 m	64.41519165039062
From the imperfect means Franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	214.20579528808594
Some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	79.50043487548828
The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere costume	500.2628479003906
I beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the Roman dialect but I do nt think I m many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran	224.89137268066406
Say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest Tuscan tis I who am too soon	123.13368225097656
But even if you had caused me to wait a little while I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours	61.321781158447266
Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man I came here direct from the Castle of St	260.4263916015625
Angelo and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo	89.36700439453125
And who is Beppo	117.90889739990234
Oh Beppo is employed in the prison and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle	88.4365234375
Indeed You are a provident person I see	68.32560729980469
Why you see no one knows what may happen	34.101585388183594
Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison	15.116032600402832
Briefly what did you learn	78.53646850585938
That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great festivals	77.63200378417969
One of the culprits will be mazzolato3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	45.17951965332031
The other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato4 and he your excellency is poor Peppino	66.50008392333984
The fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example	42.842777252197266
But Peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions	102.95594787597656
Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes	146.1112518310547
But mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator	573.6332397460938
Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them with	70.65485382080078
My good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act	82.4549789428711
Perhaps I am but one thing I have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	54.86424255371094
I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity	143.0589599609375
And what do you mean to do	86.86324310302734
To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner	39.027122497558594
That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours	151.6773681640625
And what is your excellencys project	101.69889068603516
Just this	51.74237823486328
I will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison	101.9941177368164
And do you feel sure of succeeding	14.329780578613281
Pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in French	263.66424560546875
What did your excellency say inquired the other	23.415931701660156
I said my good fellow that I would do more singlehanded by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included	158.899169921875
Leave me then to act and have no fears for the result	259.15008544921875
At least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail	46.44869613647461
None whatever	104.28417205810547
Take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I seek	30.4417667388916
Remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in	36.2607307434082
And what of that Is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute subdivided into sixty seconds Now in 86400 seconds very many things can be done	19.8066349029541
And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not	74.0880355834961
Oh that is very easily arranged	53.165802001953125
I have engaged the three lower windows at the Caf Rospoli should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it	61.740379333496094
And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution	81.92378997802734
Send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and I will give it to him	75.06007385253906
His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred	25.88142967224121
Your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not	53.44663619995117
Nay I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak	63.240142822265625
Well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another	172.69424438476562
Have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for I may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when I in my turn may require your aid and influence	152.4296112060547
Let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what I have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of	1399.2310791015625
Hush interrupted the stranger I hear a noise	1523.6871337890625
Tis some travellers who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight	48.285736083984375
Twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however I may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby	80.74433898925781
Well then if you obtain the reprieve	120.22320556640625
The middle window at the Caf Rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross	50.296783447265625
And if you fail	57.3574104309082
Then all three windows will have yellow draperies	341.8333740234375
And then	1.0454856157302856
And then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess	119.68804931640625
We understand each other perfectly then	32.69578170776367
Adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you	131.3971405029297
Saying these words the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to Franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps	109.9423828125
The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends name	185.4541015625
Franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent	27.735321044921875
In ten minutes after the strangers had departed Franz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert after the manner of Pliny and Calpurnius touching the ironpointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators	67.71419525146484
Franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred	340.58544921875
One of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	70.69387817382812
It was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that Franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum	218.4239501953125
And the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer Sinbad the Sailor	40.991329193115234
20139 m	108.78153228759766
Under any other circumstances Franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	186.3105010986328
As we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity	172.42205810546875
In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep	39.84543228149414
Slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject	49.06736755371094
Worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	27.4429874420166
Like a genuine Frenchman Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina and Franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day	173.1929168701172
At five oclock Albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at Rome	116.10635375976562
Yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to effect	708.0338745117188
Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina and also what performers appeared in it	1.0604643821716309
The opera of Parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were Coselli Moriani and La Specchia	40.784828186035156
The young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of Lucia di Lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of Italy	84.84090423583984
Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the Bouffes and had shared a lower box at the Opera	85.81539916992188
Still in spite of this Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure	284.6783752441406
Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his selflove immensely piqued to think that Albert de Morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	188.85386657714844
And the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous loveaffairs	361.3282165527344
Alas poor Albert None of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely Genoese Florentines and Neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France that they are faithful even in their infidelity	177.47218322753906
Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	83.7288589477539
Albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscounta recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of 50000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris	78.13282775878906
It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling observation	106.16315460205078
Albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the Carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	36.162052154541016
The Carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice	52.63960647583008
With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	123.97693634033203
The box taken by Albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants	118.17169952392578
Another motive had influenced Alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival	272.50994873046875
These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	120.4030532836914
Totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful operaglass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	26.663978576660156
The truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival with the Holy Week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	83.04872131347656
The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of Morianis a wellexecuted recitative by Coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of La Specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation	160.27047729492188
Towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	1.1056110858917236
The quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily	80.60511779785156
Do you know the woman who has just entered that box	94.66117095947266
Yes what do you think of her	43.999149322509766
Oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion And such magnificent hair Is she French	122.0616683959961
No a Venetian	52.722564697265625
And her name is	132.4976806640625
Countess G	83.22611999511719
Ah I know her by name exclaimed Albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty	374.5829162597656
I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villeforts ball	90.0618667602539
Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence asked Franz	168.8664093017578
My dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box	116.69576263427734
Why I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask	94.36360168457031
At that instant the countess perceived Franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head	155.66119384765625
Upon my word said Albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess	80.1095199584961
You are mistaken in thinking so returned Franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersI mean that of judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more	165.5583953857422
Is there indeed my good fellow Pray tell me is it sympathy of heart	64.78016662597656
No of taste continued Franz gravely	48.150543212890625
And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced	212.80299377441406
By the countesss visiting the Colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone	73.54955291748047
You were with her then	33.88322830200195
I was	154.48834228515625
And what did you say to her	111.97472381591797
Oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument	113.51559448242188
Upon my word cried Albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead All I can say is if ever I should get such a chance the living should be my theme	64.01254272460938
20143 m	50.79591369628906
And you will probably find your theme illchosen	74.50923919677734
But said Albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	107.345703125
Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks	195.83578491210938
Certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage	373.5831298828125
What a confounded long time this first act lasts	19.73455810546875
I believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it	142.87461853027344
Oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale	123.0748062133789
How exquisitely Coselli sings his part	150.7816619873047
But what an awkward inelegant fellow he is	98.5169906616211
Well then what do you say to La Specchia Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting	49.87019729614258
Why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to Malibran and Sontag such singers as these do nt make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others	93.99449920654297
At least you must admire Morianis style and execution	120.85102081298828
I never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womans	85.72718048095703
My good friend said Franz turning to him while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please	40.7938232421875
The curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way	44.084205627441406
Franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of Alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by Albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	55.87316131591797
This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	53.12267303466797
At the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the Italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	60.13562774658203
Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	106.00537872314453
Franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him Franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so	20.256168365478516
The countess in reply bowed gracefully to Albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to Franz then inviting Albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended Franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair	110.00987243652344
Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	57.908939361572266
Franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up Alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the audience	67.20950317382812
Sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire	318.157958984375
Behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish	233.5774383544922
Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	116.24927520751953
All I can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance	155.52392578125
Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant	135.65194702148438
And what do you think of her personal appearance	60.750701904296875
Oh I consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what Medora must have been	11.112196922302246
Franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company	213.99537658691406
The curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic artone of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass	89.72144317626953
The ballet was called Poliska	3496.898681640625
However much the ballet might have claimed his attention Franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra	1.6984963417053223
Of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams	360.552001953125
The ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience	140.42117309570312
Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps	47.61001205444336
The overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leaders bow across his violin Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on	50.89519500732422
The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though Franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature	58.85257339477539
The curtain rose and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage	114.39288330078125
Most of my readers are aware that the second act of Parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina while sleeping betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo	178.1781005859375
The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance	168.5674591064453
This duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti	105.92827606201172
Franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it	260.8177185058594
Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor Franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	935.5468139648438
The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	174.66700744628906
All doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at Rome	82.30488586425781
The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of Franzs former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened	344.4117736816406
Countess returned Franz totally unheeding her raillery I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the Albanian lady opposite I must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband	78.04127502441406
Nay answered the countess I know no more of him than yourself	105.76535034179688
Perhaps you never before noticed him	51.997108459472656
What a questionso truly French Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love	137.12738037109375
True replied Franz	81.57953643798828
All I can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	79.58763122558594
How ghastly pale he is	95.11050415039062
Oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said Franz	156.4236297607422
Then you know him almost screamed the countess	57.25901412963867
Oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what	166.9799346923828
I fancy I have seen him before and I even think he recognizes me	138.74717712402344
And I can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him	405.843505859375
The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving	1023.9473266601562
inquired Franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor	160.8535614013672
20147 m	103.13504028320312
Why that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form	11.954665184020996
This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	60.42072677612305
I must positively find out who and what he is said Franz rising from his seat	1.503700613975525
No no cried the countess you must not leave me	226.8431396484375
I depend upon you to escort me home	173.0398712158203
Oh indeed I can not permit you to go	143.4560546875
Is it possible whispered Franz that you entertain any fear	90.30255126953125
Ill tell you answered the countess	71.29431915283203
Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them	43.706947326660156
The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us	99.88448333740234
Oh he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect The coalblack hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burningthe same ghastly paleness	75.44934844970703
Then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	228.21743774414062
She is a foreignera stranger	958.1921997070312
Nobody knows who she is or where she comes from	185.06338500976562
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts	303.499267578125
I entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor shall	125.83174896240234
For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself	71.2708969116211
Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons	1.8773757219314575
Listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	116.70849609375
I am going home	30.363426208496094
I have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera	151.92478942871094
Now I can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it	144.00221252441406
There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm	129.7581787109375
It was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and Franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	95.99089813232422
Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	281.57611083984375
Upon arriving at her hotel Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants	76.2261734008789
Excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and I longed to be alone that I might compose my startled mind	45.10171127319336
Franz essayed to smile	109.87001037597656
Nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and I am sure it does not spring from your heart	93.63890075683594
However promise me one thing	33.37743377685547
What is it	120.2338638305664
Promise me I say	102.86526489257812
I will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is	88.57672119140625
I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going	96.33553314208984
Where he comes from I am ignorant but I can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt	115.35210418701172
Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said Franz	18.5467529296875
Well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	412.252685546875
There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards	210.93923950195312
For heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me	79.64275360107422
Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror	228.1518096923828
And now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	109.999755859375
For my own part I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my eyes	113.46353912353516
So saying the countess quitted Franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine	63.15766525268555
Upon his return to the hotel Franz found Albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	147.0308074951172
My dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you Why I did not expect to see you before tomorrow	43.37570571899414
My dear Albert replied Franz I am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian women	90.49562072753906
I should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time	32.07594299316406
Upon my soul these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them aright	171.4740753173828
Why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them home	120.33699798583984
Why if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever	59.53333282470703
And the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as Dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	235.81114196777344
Besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed	213.07887268066406
At what At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl Now for my part I met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from	193.15032958984375
I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmirably dressed	49.88829803466797
Indeed I feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate Paris tailorprobably Blin or Humann	97.51322937011719
He was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding	28.353384017944336
Franz smiled for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion	197.0470428466797
Well that tends to confirm my own ideas said Franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason	40.936668395996094
Did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words	39.39033889770508
I did but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect	96.09562683105469
I knew that from the mixture of Greek words	72.23263549804688
I do nt know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was ratherrather strong in Greek	54.98251724243164
He spoke the Romaic language did he	86.04613494873047
I think so	80.35747528076172
That settles it murmured Franz	96.86959075927734
Tis he past all doubt	90.64647674560547
What do you say	343.55963134765625
Nothing nothing	21.62333869934082
But tell me what were you thinking about when I came in	168.73529052734375
Oh I was arranging a little surprise for you	43.37622833251953
Of what nature	116.42607879638672
Why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage	66.81959533691406
Certainly and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one	149.69895935058594
Now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain	229.70660400390625
Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination	81.1539535522461
I tell you what M	36.56955337524414
Franz cried Albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now	50.77398681640625
And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert	174.73048400878906
Well then hearken to me	89.83849334716797
I listen	903.16552734375
You agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question	133.2040252685547
I do	88.4139175415039
Neither can we procure horses	1.086280345916748
True we have offered any sum but have failed	170.26463317871094
Well now what do you say to a cart I dare say such a thing might be had	93.52688598632812
Very possibly	85.15237426757812
And a pair of oxen	115.57768249511719
As easily found as the cart	135.17251586914062
Then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed	190.51222229003906
The cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by Lopold Robert	215.06211853027344
It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento	37.52553939819336
Our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a Madonna	1461.701416015625
Well said Franz this time M	224.94166564941406
Albert I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea	22.076566696166992
And quite a national one too replied Albert with gratified pride	122.8263931274414
A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	20.568382263183594
Ha ha ye Romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city	50.500587463378906
But you do nt know us when we ca nt have one thing we invent another	16.52261734008789
And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody	96.56258392333984
Only to our host	20.08163833618164
Upon my return home I sent for him and I then explained to him what I wished to procure	349.4120178222656
He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I desired	197.03501892089844
One thing I was sorry for when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity	89.02810668945312
And where is he now	116.0870361328125
Our host	156.62449645996094
Gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late	41.54524230957031
Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight	52.62372970581055
Oh I expect him every minute	42.994991302490234
At this instant the door opened and the head of Signor Pastrini appeared	8.898528099060059
Permesso inquired he	50.90761184692383
Certainlycertainly cried Franz	23.746273040771484
Come in my host	36.223751068115234
Now then asked Albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen	354.0861511230469
Better than that replied Signor Pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself	51.45541000366211
Take care my worthy host said Albert better is a sure enemy to well	36.9791145324707
Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded selfconfidence	11.13442325592041
But what have you done asked Franz	655.7776489257812
Speak out there s a worthy fellow	18.65037727355957
Your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves	78.27790069580078
I should think we did know it exclaimed Albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of Paris	148.58253479003906
When then the Count of Monte Cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli	209.47622680664062
The friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	18.438905715942383
But do you think asked Albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger	2.047576904296875
What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo asked Franz of his host	632.1798706054688
A very great nobleman but whether Maltese or Sicilian I can not exactly say but this I know that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold mine	185.9103546142578
It seems to me said Franz speaking in an undertone to Albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	77.14240264892578
He would have writtenor	156.0393829345703
At this instant someone knocked at the door	37.965797424316406
Come in said Franz	50.34495162963867
A servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlords hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said	16.65261459350586
Please to deliver these from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and M	177.7982177734375
Franz dpinay	42.81501388549805
The Count of Monte Cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him	76.9779281616211
Faith Franz whispered Albert there is not much to find fault with here	64.24323272705078
Tell the count replied Franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him	18.840723037719727
The servant bowed and retired	1307.358642578125
That is what I call an elegant mode of attack said Albert You were quite correct in what you said Signor Pastrini	401.69158935546875
The Count of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the world	183.28231811523438
Then you accept his offer said the host	44.463924407958984
Of course we do replied Albert	130.87083435058594
Still I must own I am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapersit would have produced such an effect And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo Rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme I do nt know but what I should have held on by my original plan	83.2431869506836
What say you Franz	152.8115234375
Oh I agree with you the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided me	97.40382385253906
The truth was that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the Transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffledup individual proved as Franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom	98.31698608398438
Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce	101.40621948242188
The next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe friend the Count of Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time	162.06414794921875
Eight oclock found Franz up and dressed while Albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep	50.905731201171875
The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness	107.63406372070312
Pray Signor Pastrini asked Franz is not some execution appointed to take place today	171.66665649414062
Yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late	227.13027954101562
Oh no answered Franz I had no such intention and even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle I might have done so from Monte Pincio could I not	43.70372772216797
Ah exclaimed mine host I did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves	1.0913382768630981
Very possibly I may not go answered Franz but in case I feel disposed give me some particulars of todays executions	348.9264831542969
What particulars would your excellency like to hear	46.68157958984375
Why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die	59.100215911865234
That happens just lucky your excellency Only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas	95.4927749633789
What are they	165.3292999267578
Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment	33.2248649597168
The reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere repentance	54.47837829589844
And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked Franz somewhat incredulously	40.14936828613281
Oh dear no your excellency I have not time for anybodys affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but I make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc	88.31485748291016
Upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part Signor Pastrini cried Franz	36.58729934692383
Why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel	78.98804473876953
I see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I go	76.75837707519531
Meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas	273.43902587890625
Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber I have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment	129.1754150390625
Then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to Franz who read as follows	71.5002212524414
The public is informed that on Wednesday February 23rd being the first day of the Carnival executions will take place in the Piazza del Popolo by order of the Tribunal of the Rota of two persons named Andrea Rondolo and Peppino otherwise called Rocca Priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named Don Csar Torlini canon of the church of St	23.47591781616211
John Lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit Luigi Vampa and his band	80.7926254272461
The firstnamed malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato	87.2420654296875
The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes	294.1080322265625
This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosseum	68.58887481689453
No part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	106.39115142822266
In all probability therefore the Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as Sinbad the Sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome as he had already done at PortoVecchio and Tunis	102.57177734375
Time was getting on however and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day	321.91290283203125
The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour	43.66442108154297
Now my excellent Signor Pastrini said Franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo	79.16961669921875
Most assuredly replied he	95.40860748291016
The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser and I can answer for his having been up these two hours	164.8220672607422
Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly	128.56907653808594
20155 m	114.73173522949219
Oh I am quite sure	349.89251708984375
I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an error	42.61671447753906
Well then if it be so are you ready Albert	120.71785736083984
Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy	150.4099884033203
Yes let us do so	174.6697540283203
The landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said	48.6027946472168
I signori Francesi	179.72239685058594
The domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	132.781982421875
They passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawingroom	108.76374816894531
The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment	343.69598388671875
Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room	200.5200653076172
If your excellencies will please to be seated said the man I will let the count know that you are here	250.1061553955078
And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portires	171.60845947265625
As the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter	69.2861557006836
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	73.74818420410156
Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey	68.40518188476562
Well said Franz to his friend what think you of all this	175.8751678466797
Why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stockjobber who has speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds or some prince travelling incog	29.762069702148438
Hush hush replied Franz we shall ascertain who and what he ishe comes	363.3348083496094
As Franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men	50.64821243286133
Albert instantly rose to meet him but Franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina but also his extraordinary host of Monte Cristo	28.634357452392578
20157 m	905.7060546875
Chapter 35	51.39751052856445
La Mazzolata	94.58753204345703
Gentlemen said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but I feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and I have held myself at your disposal	43.011802673339844
Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times count returned Albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us	76.02548217773438
Indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down	11.901708602905273
It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini that I did not sooner assist you in your distress	50.98075866699219
He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as I am I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors	145.82574462890625
As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services	35.13257598876953
The two young men bowed	69.93506622314453
Franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the counts manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum	208.30723571777344
He resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count	62.751861572265625
Moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on Franz who had nothing to conceal	346.84429931640625
However he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	77.08309173583984
Count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace	28.524166107177734
Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo	32.275718688964844
Ah said the count negligently looking attentively at Morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo	48.53532028198242
Yes returned Franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	69.4535903930664
Stay I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps I can render you this slight service also	72.63643646240234
He extended his hand and rang the bell thrice	1.1732075214385986
Did you ever occupy yourself said he to Franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants I have	71.28408813476562
When I ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus I do not waste a minute or a word	339.9154052734375
Here he is	241.35250854492188
A man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him	276.9785461425781
It was evident he had his orders	24.86802864074707
Monsieur Bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo as I ordered you yesterday	23.276338577270508
Yes excellency returned the steward but it was very late	95.22380828857422
Did I not tell you I wished for one replied the count frowning	86.7576904296875
And your excellency has one which was let to Prince Lobanieff but I was obliged to pay a hundred	180.29653930664062
That will dothat will do Monsieur Bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements	168.18954467773438
You have the window that is sufficient	32.702152252197266
Give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it	83.18949890136719
The steward bowed and was about to quit the room	165.3609161376953
Ah continued the count be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution	39.92640686035156
There is no need to do that said Franz taking out his tablets for I saw the account and copied it down	162.8726348876953
Very well you can retire M	123.45645141601562
Bertuccio I need you no longer	161.26527404785156
Let us know when breakfast is ready	123.3193588256836
These gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will I trust do me the honor to breakfast with me	130.58570861816406
But my dear count said Albert we shall abuse your kindness	87.96778106689453
Not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	87.21336364746094
You will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at Paris	50.41096496582031
Bertuccio lay covers for three	141.31422424316406
He then took Franzs tablets out of his hand	227.848388671875
We announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of February will be executed Andrea Rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated Don Csar Torlini canon of the church of St	163.26731872558594
John Lateran and Peppino called Rocca Priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his band	81.2956314086914
Hum The first will be mazzolato the second decapitato	23.739213943481445
Yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony	96.38001251220703
Really said Franz	76.83179473876953
Yes I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men	265.5267639160156
For Andrea Rondolo asked Franz	64.49546813964844
No replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for Peppino called Rocca Priori	124.35906219482422
You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple	65.83919525146484
The mandaa6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	248.18370056152344
Ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of European punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty	293.3404846191406
Really count replied Franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world	96.95295715332031
There are at least few that I have not seen said the count coldly	467.9637145996094
And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles	100.54287719726562
My first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity	87.420166015625
Curiositythat is a terrible word	106.02024841308594
Why so In life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation As for myself I can assure you of one thingthe more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation	223.09231567382812
I do not quite understand you replied Franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch	184.1265869140625
Listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other	59.774749755859375
If a man had by unheardof and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrotheda being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breastdo you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain	179.80580139160156
Yes I know said Franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant	35.80641555786133
I will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death	138.66932678222656
But are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks the augers of the Persians the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society Answer me do not these crimes exist	128.7226104736328
Yes answered Franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated	145.6584014892578
Ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance A man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart	311.9766845703125
And remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world	81.28628540039062
No no continued the count had I to avenge myself it is not thus I would take revenge	26.96845245361328
Then you disapprove of duelling You would not fight a duel asked Albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory	103.85967254638672
Oh yes replied the count understand me I would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger I have gradually acquired I should be almost certain to kill my man	322.6859436035156
Oh I would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture I would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the Orientalists sayour masters in everythingthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities	217.592529296875
But said Franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	151.08740234375
Hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught	294.3580322265625
Yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic French Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	206.48187255859375
What matters this punishment as long as he is avenged On my word I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the Carnival gentlemen how did it arise Ah I recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready	217.73794555664062
As he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying	74.2240219116211
Al suo commodo	338.50543212890625
The two young men arose and entered the breakfastroom	263.4758605957031
During the meal which was excellent and admirably served Franz looked repeatedly at Albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookerythat is the worst in the world	115.4305648803711
As for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food	193.1132049560547
This brought back to Franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire	20.407817840576172
At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch	49.356197357177734
Well said the count what are you doing	40.48556900024414
You must excuse us count returned Franz but we have still much to do	113.18087768554688
What may that be	58.96268081665039
We have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them	436.67669677734375
Do not concern yourself about that we have I think a private room in the Piazza del Popolo I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there	84.42301940917969
After the execution cried Franz	95.98457336425781
Before or after whichever you please	77.63218688964844
Opposite the scaffold	18.503328323364258
The scaffold forms part of the fte	82.90481567382812
Count I have reflected on the matter said Franz I thank you for your courtesy but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace and I leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo	50.50624465942383
But I warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count	334.0653076171875
You will describe it to me replied Franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it	41.612613677978516
I have more than once intended witnessing an execution but I have never been able to make up my mind and you Albert	220.00558471679688
I replied the viscountI saw Castaing executed but I think I was rather intoxicated that day for I had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern	287.2836608886719
Besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	89.55201721191406
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked How do they execute at Rome and you reply I do not know And besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son	60.848690032958984
Diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father	182.3446044921875
If you went to Spain would you not see the bullfights Well suppose it is a bullfight you are going to see Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men	62.942848205566406
Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said Come despatch the dying	165.33087158203125
Shall you go then Albert asked Franz	189.7069549560547
Ma foi yes like you I hesitated but the counts eloquence decides me	1.263521671295166
Let us go then said Franz since you wish it but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo I wish to pass through the Corso	534.345947265625
Is this possible count	102.08617401123047
On foot yes in a carriage no	232.0032958984375
I will go on foot then	163.9157257080078
Is it important that you should go that way	99.4744873046875
Yes there is something I wish to see	53.49528503417969
Well we will go by the Corso	56.32810974121094
We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo by the Via del Babuino for I shall be glad to pass myself through the Corso to see if some orders I have given have been executed	125.92772674560547
Excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you	74.50192260742188
Ah yes returned the count I know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre table	104.5595703125
I will be with you directly	59.97995376586914
The young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	252.57054138183594
Albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Caf de Paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros	50.54938507080078
Well asked Franz what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo	77.75321960449219
What do I think said Albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion I think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like Brutus of the Stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars	24.3421688079834
Such was Alberts opinion of the count and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it	60.675140380859375
But said he did you observe one very singular thing	34.96809387207031
How attentively he looked at you	84.42092895507812
At me	80.6489028930664
Albert reflected	78.7297592163086
Ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising I have been more than a year absent from Paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial	30.342206954956055
The first opportunity you have undeceive him I beg and tell him I am nothing of the kind	35.08183670043945
Franz smiled an instant after the count entered	43.1859245300293
I am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	60.67268371582031
The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo and we will go another and if you please by the Corso	123.11553955078125
Take some more of these cigars M	32.12542724609375
de Morcerf	23.432769775390625
With all my heart returned Albert Italian cigars are horrible	366.9738464355469
When you come to Paris I will return all this	65.73028564453125
I will not refuse I intend going there soon and since you allow me I will pay you a visit	46.90910339355469
Come we have not any time to lose it is halfpast twelvelet us set off	252.66812133789062
All three descended the coachman received his masters orders and drove down the Via del Babuino	44.74060821533203
While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli palaces Franzs attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant	94.27558135986328
Which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume	79.66455841064453
The three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put	59.62020492553711
Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	48.05362319946289
The side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross	27.04302978515625
The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	74.11029815673828
The three windows were still untenanted	35.3142204284668
Preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags	8.293911933898926
The masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors	28.35234832763672
Franz Albert and the count continued to descend the Corso	81.21976470947266
As they approached the Piazza del Popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del Babuino del Corso and di Ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaa	60.77263259887695
At the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his master	122.83184814453125
The window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pincio	71.62477111816406
It consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone	54.20240783691406
On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin	62.09849166870117
20167 m	56.97850036621094
As you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends I have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour	40.74662780761719
Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre	69.70674133300781
It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the Roman mandaa is formed on almost the same model as the French instrument	51.833282470703125
7 The knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference	63.18694305419922
Two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal	20.30642318725586
Their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	28.654335021972656
One of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion	39.308170318603516
These two men were the executioners assistants	119.40587615966797
At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow	125.89896392822266
The prisoners transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	63.64008712768555
A double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet	148.0891876220703
All the rest of the square was paved with heads	46.047855377197266
Many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view	137.09274291992188
The Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a particolored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue	12.894065856933594
What the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death	41.479557037353516
And yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	82.8246078491211
It was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the Carnival	1.055395245552063
Suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	61.621612548828125
A brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	79.58308410644531
20169 m	885.0693359375
Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	31.864545822143555
He was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledgehammer	118.4704360961914
This man was the executioner	58.736759185791016
He had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	45.27606201171875
Behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first Peppino and then Andrea	74.91211700439453
Each was accompanied by two priests	52.85795211791992
Neither had his eyes bandaged	78.01336669921875
Peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	41.46295166015625
Andrea was supported by two priests	167.14906311035156
Each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them	39.195899963378906
At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him	32.548587799072266
He looked at Alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	98.4211654663086
The count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	75.65967559814453
His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal	90.05598449707031
And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as Franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity	68.9962158203125
However the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible	252.9215087890625
Peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear	83.25894927978516
Andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty	14.989754676818848
In prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious	108.1334228515625
I thought said Franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution	102.68045806884766
I told you true replied he coldly	88.73507690429688
And yet here are two culprits	46.175899505615234
Yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live	153.68447875976562
If the pardon is to come there is no time to lose	28.479921340942383
And see here it is said the count	174.4153289794922
At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the mandaa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper	74.78987121582031
The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed all	3.796088695526123
The chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand Heaven be praised and his Holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners	21.742345809936523
A pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon	96.23957061767578
At this cry Andrea raised his head	159.12533569335938
Pardon for whom cried he	53.3221321105957
Peppino remained breathless	34.263912200927734
A pardon for Peppino called Rocca Priori said the principal friar	51.3996696472168
And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him	84.19652557373047
For Peppino cried Andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged	52.16447448730469
Why for him and not for me We ought to die together	41.50883102416992
I was promised he should die with me	103.76150512695312
You have no right to put me to death alone	59.216609954833984
I will not die aloneI will not	19.21782875061035
And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	188.63040161132812
The executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him	36.179161071777344
What is going on asked Franz of the count for as all the talk was in the Roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	105.61536407470703
Do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellowsufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of	71.60346221923828
Oh man manrace of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do I recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves	46.424869537353516
Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming He ought to diehe shall dieI will not die alone	98.36377716064453
Look look cried the count seizing the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious	67.25137329101562
Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance	128.94261169433594
Do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him It was that another partook of his punishmentthat another partook of his anguishthat another was to die before him Lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy	74.17926788330078
But manman whom God created in his own imageman upon whom God has laid his first his sole commandment to love his neighborman to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughtswhat is his first cry when he hears his fellowman is saved A blasphemy	47.863895416259766
Honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation	61.98988723754883
And the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh	193.30604553222656
However the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness	55.11228942871094
The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against Andrea and twenty thousand voices cried Put him to death put him to death	57.112770080566406
Franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	150.24826049804688
What are you doing said he	39.094825744628906
Do you pity him If you heard the cry of Mad dog you would take your gunyou would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	153.7596893310547
And yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish	19.667892456054688
No nolook look	83.43997955322266
20172 m	16.313316345214844
The recommendation was needless	19.028600692749023
Franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	98.20907592773438
The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees	3.796088695526123
During this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple	21.742345809936523
A dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back	79.13368225097656
The executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	52.95610427856445
At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound	243.55348205566406
This time Franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat	63.26674270629883
Albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the windowcurtains	44.80112075805664
The count was erect and triumphant like the Avenging Angel	39.176673889160156
Chapter 36	59.024261474609375
The Carnival at Rome	100.89991760253906
When Franz recovered his senses he saw Albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume	553.8038940429688
He glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	64.85054016113281
The bell of Monte Citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the Carnival was ringing a joyous peal	62.264652252197266
Well asked he of the count what has then happened	24.94456672668457
Nothing replied the count only as you see the Carnival has commenced	376.7403564453125
Make haste and dress yourself	113.84089660644531
In fact said Franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream	6.462138652801514
It is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you	54.05580520629883
Yes that I have suffered but the culprit	18.087675094604492
That is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate	31.466209411621094
But Peppinowhat has become of him	102.53744506835938
Peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion	82.33625030517578
He profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	145.33766174316406
Decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal	32.06016159057617
But dress yourself see M	176.33804321289062
de Morcerf sets you the example	116.5276107788086
Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots	88.40603637695312
Well Albert said Franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels Come answer frankly	98.56956481933594
Ma foi no returned Albert	31.9501895904541
But I am really glad to have seen such a sight and I understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion	19.244606018066406
20175 m	56.70945739746094
Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed	619.7085571289062
It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel Come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves	150.13002014160156
Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	284.7461242675781
He assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face	56.35873794555664
Their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets	218.77011108398438
They fell into the line of carriages	25.46865463256836
It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place	27.604251861572266
Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the Piazza del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry	20.81109046936035
A crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	378.20623779296875
From every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists Transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh	13.460695266723633
Franz and Albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present	175.88900756835938
They saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	39.7540168762207
A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged	1.0986857414245605
He rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of	49.79620361328125
20177 m	38.878963470458984
The strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young mens minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld	204.080078125
As for the Count of Monte Cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved	36.643310546875
Imagine the large and splendid Corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags	55.479820251464844
At these balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsRomans Italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius	30.286930084228516
Lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers	40.753440856933594
In the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesgigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from mens shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in Callots Temptation of St	19.059293746948242
Anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends	66.1343002319336
This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome	162.31178283691406
At the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal	115.42220306396484
Franz looked upthey were opposite the Rospoli Palace	11385.984375
At the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which Franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the Argentina	231.5890350341797
Gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows	30.83134651184082
In the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants	169.7191162109375
We have forgotten to mention that the counts coachman was attired in a bearskin exactly resembling Odrys in The Bear and the Pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed	5.243785858154297
Franz thanked the count for his attention	142.71194458007812
As for Albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him	77.64839935302734
Unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo the other ascended towards the Palazzo di Venezia	97.93368530273438
Ah my dear fellow said he to Franz you did not see	78.10370635986328
Therethat calash filled with Roman peasants	118.58228302001953
Well I am convinced they are all charming women	46.76179504394531
How unfortunate that you were masked Albert said Franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments	313.64117431640625
Oh replied he half laughing half serious I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other	41.958274841308594
But in spite of Alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman peasants	23.306537628173828
At one of these encounters accidentally or purposely Alberts mask fell off	26.817909240722656
He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	50.89908981323242
Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets	132.1340789794922
Albert seized it and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered Albert to retain it	12.445605278015137
Albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	13.982218742370605
Well said Franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure	44.351959228515625
Laugh if you pleaseI really think so	51.523624420166016
So I will not abandon this bouquet	40.95576095581055
Pardieu returned Franz laughing in token of your ingratitude	389.91900634765625
The jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to Albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his buttonhole	41.80679702758789
Bravo bravo said Franz things go wonderfully	117.41702270507812
Shall I leave you Perhaps you would prefer being alone	55.593162536621094
No replied he I will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	27.332075119018555
If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and I shall know what I have to do	228.3251953125
On my word said Franz you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as Ulysses and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind	6862.447265625
Albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets	74.30394744873047
Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited	117.3608627319336
At this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	120.29878997802734
The file on the Corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared	156.6515350341797
Franz and Albert were opposite the Via delle Muratte the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli Palace and stopped at the door of the hotel	37.33116149902344
Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his guests	43.348052978515625
Franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but Pastrini reassured him by saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the Rospoli Palace	182.95486450195312
The count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the Argentina	135.44615173339844
Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a tailor	49.49928665161133
A tailor said the host and for what	335.6471862792969
To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes returned Albert	80.14688873291016
The host shook his head	130.8932342529297
To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow I ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a French demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button	16.078887939453125
Then I must give up the idea	92.79424285888672
No we have them readymade	33.863868713378906
Leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied	44.24024963378906
My dear Albert said Franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see lItalienne   Alger	41.83198165893555
Agreed returned Albert but remember Signor Pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for	73.27304077148438
The host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes	173.37741088867188
Albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	42.33873748779297
The two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristos table and that of Signor Pastrini	47.76300811767578
Truth compelled Franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrinis side	28.55561637878418
During dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage	47.97573471069336
Albert and Franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the counts kindness	102.38969421386719
The servant understood them	17.3919734954834
His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion	76.39862060546875
They resolved to profit by the counts courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained	142.13104248046875
20181 m	80.15480041503906
This precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the counts box	41.48310470581055
During the first act the Countess G entered	60.01860427856445
Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to Franz	89.79505920410156
Her operaglass was so fixedly directed towards them that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the Italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess	33.31137466430664
Scarcely had they entered when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor	14.852975845336914
Albert in his turn sat behind	35.6120719909668
Well said she hardly giving Franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord Ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world	253.28875732421875
Without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned Franz I can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day	178.48165893554688
All day	144.03497314453125
Yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box	126.49024200439453
You know him then	97.07549285888672
Yes and no	185.4381866455078
How so	81.23278045654297
It is a long story	121.02759552001953
Tell it to me	192.73171997070312
It would frighten you too much	135.77671813964844
So much the more reason	39.92848205566406
At least wait until the story has a conclusion	73.91657257080078
Very well I prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance Did anyone introduce you to him	10.340657234191895
No it was he who introduced himself to us	50.17432403564453
Last night after we left you	72.00536346435547
Through what medium	56.952537536621094
The very prosaic one of our landlord	116.1469497680664
He is staying then at the Htel de Londres with you	135.30877685546875
Not only in the same hotel but on the same floor	73.00262451171875
What is his name for of course you know	75.29326629638672
The Count of Monte Cristo	118.05049133300781
That is not a family name	38.967864990234375
No it is the name of the island he has purchased	29.07044792175293
And he is a count	259.35455322265625
A Tuscan count	205.38668823242188
Well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest Venetian families	129.9427490234375
What sort of a man is he	75.01509857177734
Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf	65.02716827392578
You hear M	86.7139663696289
de Morcerf I am referred to you said the countess	65.88841247558594
We should be very hard to please madam returned Albert did we not think him delightful	1.0501693487167358
A friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy	67.48072814941406
Come observed the countess smiling I see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid being confounded with M	82.49009704589844
de Rothschild and you have seen her	123.41171264648438
20183 m	176.79217529296875
The beautiful Greek of yesterday	174.7401580810547
No we heard I think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible	80.5786361694336
When you say invisible interrupted Albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains	59.3203239440918
Where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	80.09164428710938
At the Rospoli Palace	1.1791625022888184
The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace	24.38273048400879
Did you pass through the Corso	61.435367584228516
Well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross Those were the counts windows	90.50572204589844
Why he must be a nabob	97.0850830078125
Do you know what those three windows were worth	90.0416030883789
Two or three hundred Roman crowns	34.92329406738281
Two or three thousand	49.964046478271484
The deuce	91.73501586914062
Does his island produce him such a revenue	57.77384948730469
It does not bring him a bajocco	22.865205764770508
Then why did he purchase it	17.198341369628906
For a whim	90.98246765136719
He is an original then	92.33251190185547
In reality observed Albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at Paris and a frequenter of the theatres I should say he was a poor devil literally mad	53.93789291381836
This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or Anthony	20.860074996948242
At this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom Franz gave up his seat to him	45.04082107543945
This circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	143.99066162109375
Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied	40.781978607177734
The next morning at nine oclock he entered Franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fte days	57.698055267333984
Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressa jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat	208.20187377929688
This picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	46.108802795410156
The Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal Franz complimented Albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction	57.691314697265625
They were thus engaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered	138.09532165527344
20185 m	25.306690216064453
Gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable	28.028671264648438
I come to say that today and for the remainder of the Carnival I leave the carriage entirely at your disposal	95.75308227539062
The host will tell you I have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way	105.79803466796875
Make use of it I pray you for your pleasure or your business	23.047691345214844
The young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them	100.02336883544922
The Count of Monte Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	187.069580078125
He was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries	321.5697326660156
A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures	118167.2578125
A few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry	84.13251495361328
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini	41.81884002685547
They told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy	64.61925506591797
Albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge	40.72212600708008
The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	39.19108200073242
At halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of Franz and Albert	105.23858642578125
Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his buttonhole	45.838157653808594
At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the Corso by the Via Vittoria	70.73818969726562
At the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to Albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his	66.71491241455078
Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his buttonhole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also	155.56065368652344
The day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared	106.48249816894531
It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between Albert and the fair peasant continued all day	130.25369262695312
In the evening on his return Franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	153.39015197753906
At each previous visit he had made to Rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of St	55.00629806518555
Peters successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues	139.43348693847656
He did not then think of the Carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one can not incline ones self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI	13.7935791015625
On his return from the Vatican Franz carefully avoided the Corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation	76.19979858398438
At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed	84.71122741699219
The harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	20.45171356201172
She was charming	42.68406295776367
Franz congratulated Albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	70.24129486083984
He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy	1.169018030166626
He had made up his mind to write to her the next day	103.26372528076172
Franz remarked while he gave these details that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it	20.201549530029297
He insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished	76.17465209960938
Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	40.70802307128906
Albert attributed to Franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask	26.851350784301758
Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity	65.58222961425781
He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over Italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share Franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	152.7305908203125
He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli Palace	34.617652893066406
The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle	120.26810455322266
This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	48.29492950439453
The evening was no longer joy but delirium	59.228126525878906
Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner	148.453857421875
Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	46.59379577636719
Albert was not deceived for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner	51.25331497192383
Well said he was I mistaken	64.24666595458984
She has answered you cried Franz	81.26644134521484
This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe	186.33590698242188
Franz took the letter and read	69.31578826904297
Tuesday evening at seven oclock descend from your carriage opposite the Via dei Pontefici and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your torch from you	57.60057830810547
When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rosecolored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized	116.5911865234375
Until then you will not see me	1737.98828125
Constancy and Discretion	2875.921875
Well asked he when Franz had finished what do you think of that	56.20683670043945
I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance	154.4103546142578
I think so also replied Albert and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Braccianos ball	33.531978607177734
Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker	42.19452667236328
Take care Albert said Franz	72.67450714111328
All the nobility of Rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there	46.29436492919922
Whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned Albert	64.38844299316406
You have read the letter	96.1052017211914
You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in Italy This is the name of the lower class	87.46691131591797
Well read the letter again	120.60630798339844
Look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography	233.6255645751953
The writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable	205.87998962402344
You are born to good fortune said Franz as he returned the letter	125.25729370117188
Laugh as much as you will replied Albert I am in love	105.51806640625
You alarm me cried Franz	66.1739501953125
I see that I shall not only go alone to the Duke of Braccianos but also return to Florence alone	117.57915496826172
If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said Albert I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks at least	99.87567138671875
I adore Rome and I have always had a great taste for archology	331.89453125
20189 m	61.46092224121094
Come two or three more such adventures and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the Academy	63.52726745605469
Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready	49.09585189819336
Alberts love had not taken away his appetite	92.32384490966797
He hastened with Franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	48.183837890625
After dinner the Count of Monte Cristo was announced	48.02313232421875
They had not seen him for two days	446.17230224609375
Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia	46.016963958740234
He had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	47.016658782958984
He was charming	33.514225006103516
Whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else	43.41777801513672
The man was an enigma to Franz	133.09849548339844
The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	101.67454528808594
On his side however great Franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it	51.841644287109375
The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre and were told they were all let	138.67872619628906
In consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his visit	110.31959533691406
Franz and Albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the Palli Theatre the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it	62.97614288330078
This assurance determined the two friends to accept it	17.957782745361328
Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	101.56591033935547
He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor	115.08689880371094
Truly a Byronic hero Franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfreds shoulders or beneath Laras helmet	188.40342712402344
His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	213.4698944091797
The count was no longer young	81.84351348876953
He was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	45.03166580200195
And to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	317.2216491699219
Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man	116.54727935791016
Franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering	32.77256774902344
He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there	187.29226684570312
And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was there	32.576133728027344
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing	68.18357849121094
The Countess G wished to revive the subject of the count but Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of Alberts demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days	36.40196228027344
As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated Albert on his success	73.12052154541016
They promised upon separating to meet at the Duke of Braccianos ball to which all Rome was invited	72.20745849609375
The heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after	28.00454330444336
At length Tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the Carnival	1.0386847257614136
On Tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as Lent begins after eight at night	35.57225799560547
On Tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the Carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement	66.57283020019531
From two oclock till five Franz and Albert followed in the fte exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	209.2742462158203
The ftes are veritable pleasure days to the Italians	19.838348388671875
The author of this history who has resided five or six years in Italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries	52.42530822753906
Albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume	22.565269470214844
A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	34.23316192626953
In order that there might be no confusion Franz wore his peasants costume	74.15239715576172
As the day advanced the tumult became greater	49.4740104675293
There was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move	34.34465408325195
It was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	166.19630432128906
At three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin	292.4278259277344
The races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the Carnival	13.870150566101074
At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	441.10418701171875
All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter	34.53388214111328
The pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard	413.37017822265625
A detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the barberi	20.901948928833008
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear	17.991411209106445
Almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning	51.6094856262207
Then the Castle of Saint Angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won	45.502811431884766
Immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the Corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	266.58746337890625
A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	197.30909729003906
The sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene	110.40242767333984
The moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two very serious problems to grapple withfirst how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others	73.28111267089844
The moccoletto is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from God	64.63549041748047
But he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	88.67599487304688
The moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light	53.45705032348633
But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccolettothe gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans	246.48316955566406
Everyone hastened to purchase moccolettiFranz and Albert among the rest	127.63346862792969
The night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of Moccoletti repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	64.0917739868164
It was a signal	113.40318298339844
At the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo and mounting from the Piazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia	108.09516906738281
It seemed like the fte of Jackolanterns	75.22593688964844
It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it	154.53123474121094
Suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world	184.97303771972656
The facchino follows the prince the Transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting	74.18514251708984
Had old olus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and Aquilo the heirpresumptive to the throne	106.01245880126953
This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the Corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible	449.1866760253906
Every five minutes Albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	1.133068323135376
The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici	3.6204442977905273
Albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand	87.59503936767578
Two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but Albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of San Giacomo	133.34320068359375
The steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others torches	495.4411926269531
Franz followed Albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step	94.41423034667969
Instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance	473.9183654785156
Franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw Albert disappear arminarm with the peasant girl	93.01933288574219
He watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello	27.34386444091797
Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment	37.98848342895508
It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	90.45722198486328
Franz found himself in utter darkness	94.87925720214844
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	46.625396728515625
The Carnival was over	71.38452911376953
20193 m	146.3577423095703
Chapter 37	49.890830993652344
The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian	451.6636962890625
In his whole life perhaps Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment	209.09500122070312
It seemed as though Rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb	741.8701782226562
By a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	938.55078125
The distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the Htel de Londres	22.24727439880371
Dinner was waiting but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon Franz sat down without him	81.19123077392578
Signor Pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	207.8357696533203
The sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in Franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness	58.75606155395508
He therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything	350.339599609375
Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible	95.42267608642578
He ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel	115.53607940673828
At eleven oclock Albert had not come back	251.21148681640625
Franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Braccianos	73.61046600341797
The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most delightful in Rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the Colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their ftes have a European celebrity	321.95098876953125
Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion	52.59124755859375
Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello	171.5586395263672
Then he has not returned said the duke	83.11860656738281
I waited for him until this hour replied Franz	135.62814331054688
And do you know whither he went	106.67501068115234
No not precisely however I think it was something very like a rendezvous	169.12612915039062
Diavolo said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late is it not countess	423.0551452636719
These words were addressed to the Countess G who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia the dukes brother	80.08866882324219
I think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight	604.5657958984375
I am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome	96.49188995361328
Ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of Rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball	87.8753433227539
Our friend Albert de Morcerf countess whom I left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this evening said Franz and whom I have not seen since	148.84327697753906
And do nt you know where he is	70.95783996582031
Not at all	305.54962158203125
Is he armed	126.53126525878906
He is in masquerade	54.65298080444336
You should not have allowed him to go said the duke to Franz you who know Rome better than he does	99.49787139892578
You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied Franz and then moreover what could happen to him	456.8204650878906
Who can tell The night is gloomy and the Tiber is very near the Via Macello	40.7603759765625
Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	269.99591064453125
I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here duke said Franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return	94.72140502929688
Ah replied the duke here I think is one of my servants who is seeking you	237.0108184814453
The duke was not mistaken when he saw Franz the servant came up to him	87.2055892944336
Your excellency he said the master of the Htel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcerf	310.8287353515625
A letter from the viscount exclaimed Franz	106.39013671875
And who is the man	164.46768188476562
I do not know	80.59050750732422
Why did he not bring it to me here	140.93218994140625
The messenger did not say	188.96636962890625
And where is the messenger	1.2205735445022583
He went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you	69.1790542602539
Oh said the countess to Franz go with all speedpoor young man Perhaps some accident has happened to him	240.74813842773438
I will hasten replied Franz	83.63397216796875
Shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess	77.13063049316406
Yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise I can not answer as to what I may do myself	899.8568115234375
Be prudent in any event said the countess	41.36288833618164
Oh pray be assured of that	168.654541015625
Franz took his hat and went away in haste	31.238767623901367
He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two oclock fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano which is on one side in the Corso and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the Htel de Londres	32.78647994995117
As he came near the hotel Franz saw a man in the middle of the street	285.8594665527344
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert	63.85118865966797
The man was wrapped up in a large cloak	21.742345809936523
He went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him	164.08392333984375
What wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	181.75222778320312
Are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired Franz from the Viscount of Morcerf	171.53680419921875
Your excellency lodges at Pastrinis hotel	37.64868927001953
I do	82.53215789794922
Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount	74.9436264038086
I am	103.33721923828125
Your excellencys name	20.6547794342041
Is the Baron Franz dpinay	36.53519821166992
20199 m	37.495792388916016
Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed	101.62928771972656
Is there any answer inquired Franz taking the letter from him	87.6916732788086
Yesyour friend at least hopes so	38.05692672729492
Come upstairs with me and I will give it to you	179.28158569335938
I prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	178.31808471679688
And why	51.44109344482422
Your excellency will know when you have read the letter	146.1861572265625
Shall I find you here then	57.17655944824219
Franz entered the hotel	22.657556533813477
On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini	43.3401985168457
Well said the landlord	247.14801025390625
Wellwhat responded Franz	69.9233627319336
You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of Franz	229.96875
Yes I have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me	89.77348327636719
Light the candles in my apartment if you please	203.17959594726562
The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light	104.8711929321289
The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read Alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it	108.81452178955078
It was written and signed by Albert	67.5190658569336
Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained	139.9224395751953
It was thus worded	129.58116149902344
My dear Fellow	127.92037963867188
The moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocketbook which you will find in the square drawer of the secrtaire add your own to it if it be not sufficient	599.8776245117188
Run to Torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer	39.44465637207031
It is urgent that I should have this money without delay	50.58732604980469
I do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me	48.72426223754883
Your friend	25.653400421142578
Albert de Morcerf	38.49958419799805
I now believe in Italian banditti	30.80405044555664
Below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in Italian	79.39822387695312
Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il Conte Alberto avr cessato di vivere	16.214441299438477
Luigi Vampa	83.67310333251953
If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the Count Albert will have ceased to live	1208.2647705078125
This second signature explained everything to Franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him	139.51016235351562
Albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe	358.75762939453125
There was no time to lose	39.61027526855469
He hastened to open the secrtaire and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of credit	136.94371032714844
There were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three thousand	210.74903869628906
As to Franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at Florence and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left	244.181884765625
Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required	180.5991668701172
True he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torlonia	1699.1077880859375
He was therefore about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind	189.10826110839844
He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo	186.83432006835938
Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini when that worthy presented himself	360.69866943359375
My dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within	203.23385620117188
Yes your excellency he has this moment returned	123.01607513427734
Is he in bed	37.13681411743164
I should say no	89.9453125
Then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience	80.14898681640625
Signor Pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said	122.4634017944336
The count awaits your excellency	56.327789306640625
Franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count	30.982826232910156
He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	78.77800750732422
The count came towards him	37.79201889038086
Well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me It would be very kind of you	109.07296752929688
No I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter	236.46017456054688
A serious matter said the count looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be	55.69746398925781
Are we alone	200.5001678466797
Yes replied the count going to the door and returning	91.26942443847656
Franz gave him Alberts letter	11709.8427734375
Read that he said	94.34281921386719
The count read it	22.287904739379883
Well well said he	82.37928771972656
Did you see the postscript	161.2029266357422
I did indeed	77.81455993652344
Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte Alberto avr cessato di vivere	36.6973762512207
Luigi Vampa	55.915462493896484
What think you of that inquired Franz	153.448974609375
Have you the money he demands	102.3673324584961
Yes all but eight hundred piastres	130.202880859375
The count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to Franz I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself	422.7046813964844
You see on the contrary I come to you first and instantly replied Franz	3370.595703125
And I thank you have what you will and he made a sign to Franz to take what he pleased	2456.149658203125
Is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to Luigi Vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count	54.7863655090332
Judge for yourself replied he	120.04488372802734
The postscript is explicit	49.45476531982422
I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said Franz	182.3953094482422
How so returned the count with surprise	39.0965690612793
If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa I am sure he would not refuse you Alberts freedom	98.75106811523438
What influence can I possibly have over a bandit	90.98429107666016
Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten	34.516448974609375
What is that	42.103702545166016
Have you not saved Peppinos life	144.02108764648438
Well well said the count who told you that	208.7804718017578
No matter I know it	156.94252014160156
The count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	114.64570617675781
And if I went to seek Vampa would you accompany me	214.64166259765625
If my society would not be disagreeable	150.12179565429688
Be it so	74.80168151855469
It is a lovely night and a walk without Rome will do us both good	55.03434371948242
Shall I take any arms	21.8315486907959
For what purpose	119.51068878173828
Any money	196.5345001220703
It is useless	57.6705207824707
Where is the man who brought the letter	73.44819641113281
In the street	302.9947814941406
He awaits the answer	113.47381591796875
I must learn where we are going	51.056087493896484
I will summon him hither	81.95293426513672
It is useless he would not come up	130.4967041015625
To your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine	555.0514526367188
The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner	34.37696838378906
The man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street	136.01161193847656
Salite said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	51.81063461303711
The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room	127.06175231933594
Ah it is you Peppino said the count	44.27446746826172
But Peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with kisses	1.0454856157302856
Ah said the count you have then not forgotten that I saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago	311.5154113769531
20203 m	50.787715911865234
No excellency and never shall I forget it returned Peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	77.1850814819336
Never That is a long time but it is something that you believe so	69.75192260742188
Rise and answer	124.6739273071289
Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz	22.74702262878418
Oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	64.41242980957031
You allow me to give you this title continued the count in French it is necessary to excite this mans confidence	579.75439453125
You can speak before me said Franz I am a friend of the counts	77.96509552001953
Good returned Peppino	82.5091781616211
I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me	239.7493896484375
How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigis hands	47.94463348388672
Excellency the Frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was Teresa	55.54093551635742
The chiefs mistress	47.40342712402344
The Frenchman threw her a bouquet Teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage	85.87274932861328
What cried Franz was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants	107.65311431884766
It was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied Peppino	135.25193786621094
Well said the count	279.770263671875
Well then the Frenchman took off his mask Teresa with the chiefs consent did the same	32.347408294677734
The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous Teresa gave him oneonly instead of Teresa it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giacomo	18.269166946411133
What exclaimed Franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him	45.84666061401367
Was a lad of fifteen replied Peppino	80.97467041015625
But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived Beppo has taken in plenty of others	99.39776611328125
And Beppo led him outside the walls said the count	88.3758544921875
Exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello	62.945457458496094
Beppo got in inviting the Frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice	60.41574478149414
He gallantly offered the righthand seat to Beppo and sat by him	74.23096466064453
Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	115.4343032836914
The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same	134.72657775878906
At the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the Almo surrounded the carriage	57.33332061767578
The Frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled Beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield	74.10908508300781
They made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St	152.15213012695312
Well said the count turning towards Franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	1.1716585159301758
What do you say to it	81.82829284667969
Why that I should think it very amusing replied Franz if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert	159.81349182128906
And in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence	86.18690490722656
And shall we go and find him inquired Franz	372.0466613769531
Oh decidedly sir	259.58380126953125
He is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of St	65.10939025878906
I was never in them but I have often resolved to visit them	34.32372283935547
Well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better	73.36163330078125
Have you a carriage	60.466609954833984
That is of no consequence I always have one ready day and night	49.711273193359375
Always ready	164.74765014648438
I am a very capricious being and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night I resolve on starting for some particular point and away I go	75.33251190185547
The count rang and a footman appeared	31.055604934692383
Order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters	1.0208989381790161
You need not awaken the coachman Ali will drive	111.0000228881836
In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door	89.72012329101562
The count took out his watch	113.40306854248047
Halfpast twelve he said	409.03125
We might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels	100.00214385986328
Are you still resolved to accompany me	215.29470825195312
More determined than ever	35.80134582519531
Well then come along	110.0473403930664
Franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by Peppino	98.21464538574219
At the door they found the carriage	63.41204833984375
Ali was on the box in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo	95.85797119140625
Franz and the count got into the carriage	340.923583984375
Peppino placed himself beside Ali and they set off at a rapid pace	115.71680450439453
Ali had received his instructions and went down the Corso crossed the Campo Vaccino went up the Strada San Gregorio and reached the gates of St	91.78079223632812
Then the porter raised some difficulties but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way	70.8824234008789
The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way and bordered with tombs	63.48238754272461
From time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Peppino	43.92878723144531
A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped Peppino opened the door and the count and Franz alighted	52.14739990234375
In ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there	54.024173736572266
He then took Peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and Peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage	65.77069091796875
Five minutes elapsed during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	67.25310516357422
Now said the count let us follow him	111.50909423828125
Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley	42.11680603027344
They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity	109.76622009277344
Ought we to go on asked Franz of the count or should we pause	102.15376281738281
Let us go on Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming	259.49407958984375
One of the two men was Peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout	82.3763427734375
Franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	127.50638580322266
Your excellency said Peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand	105.26433563232422
Go on then replied the count	49.84184646606445
They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass	57.75225067138672
Peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened	13.691474914550781
Peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	60.38734436035156
The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him closely	34.18511962890625
The passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	218.25311279296875
They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by Who comes there At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel	30.178831100463867
A friend responded Peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed	114.6703109741211
Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	138.318603515625
Franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	229.0208740234375
Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs	199.1278839111328
Down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	90.19767761230469
The count laid his hand on Franzs shoulder	103.53895568847656
Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	263.0791320800781
Exceedingly replied Franz	43.66914749145508
Come with me then	136.24053955078125
Peppino put out the torch	64.65697479248047
Peppino obeyed and Franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since Peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall	72.12261199951172
They advanced silently the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark	80.74359893798828
Franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	73.98251342773438
Three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door	74.05455017089844
These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken	346.83538818359375
In the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them	65.32122802734375
A lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow	263.0647277832031
A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated him	56.16678237915039
This was the chief of the band Luigi Vampa	147.67666625976562
Around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach	32.81114196777344
At the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	18.258455276489258
When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards Vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps	19.4278621673584
Who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his chief	14.556954383850098
At this challenge Vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	28.29360008239746
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count	52.589630126953125
Well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear Vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony	146.35494995117188
20207 m	43.44025802612305
Ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said Your pardon your excellency but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that I did not really recognize you	129.01617431640625
It seems that your memory is equally short in everything Vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them	10.141345024108887
What conditions have I forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it	137.68832397460938
Was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friends should be respected by you	33.80872344970703
And how have I broken that treaty your excellency	117.85487365722656
You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount Albert de Morcerf	105.21675872802734
Well continued the count in a tone that made Franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friendsthis young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfthis young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet I repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger	42.73622131347656
Why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look	12.420124053955078
Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands By heavens if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency I would blow his brains out with my own hand	35.360198974609375
20211 m	145.36212158203125
Well said the count turning towards Franz I told you there was some mistake in this	95.14193725585938
Are you not alone asked Vampa with uneasiness	655.1553344726562
I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word	50.633853912353516
Come your excellency the count added turning to Franz here is Luigi Vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed	142.3058624267578
Franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him	24.929685592651367
Welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened	170.1668243408203
But said Franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscountI do not see him	132.6848907470703
Nothing has happened to him I hope said the count frowningly	82.98367309570312
The prisoner is there replied Vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and I will go myself and tell him he is free	78.96631622314453
The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Alberts prison and Franz and the count followed him	224.47921752929688
What is the prisoner doing inquired Vampa of the sentinel	34.929019927978516
Ma foi captain replied the sentry I do not know for the last hour I have not heard him stir	153.9214324951172
Come in your excellency said Vampa	36.64352035522461
The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door	110.57992553710938
Then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber	85.8682861328125
Come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning	340.8764343261719
Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage	115.72425079345703
You are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends	22.20701026916504
Then going to Albert he touched him on the shoulder saying Will your excellency please to awaken	99.02838134765625
Albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes	129.453369140625
Oh said he is it you captain You should have allowed me to sleep	19.428014755249023
I had such a delightful dream	3060.229248046875
I was dancing the galop at Torlonias with the Countess G	187.35166931152344
Then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped	27.54395866394043
Halfpast one only said he	107.91059112548828
Why the devil do you rouse me at this hour	92.50142669677734
To tell you that you are free your excellency	757.1705932617188
My dear fellow replied Albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future Napoleons maxim Never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on I should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life	211.31436157226562
So then they have paid my ransom	66.40919494628906
No your excellency	99.52203369140625
Well then how am I free	27.584022521972656
A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you	94.97368621826172
Come hither	211.85382080078125
Yes hither	158.9728240966797
Really Then that person is a most amiable person	2311.214111328125
Albert looked around and perceived Franz	80.138671875
What said he is it you my dear Franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed	83.74650573730469
No not I replied Franz but our neighbor the Count of Monte Cristo	488.5428771972656
Oh my dear count said Albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and I hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it	110.00174713134766
The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for Franz he was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	36.073280334472656
My dear Albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonias	118.32743835449219
You may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to Signor Luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman	33.42434310913086
You are decidedly right and we may reach the Palazzo by two oclock	43.03900146484375
Signor Luigi continued Albert is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency	47.94449234008789
None sir replied the bandit you are as free as air	51.7874755859375
Well then a happy and merry life to you	176.89817810058594
Come gentlemen come	1.0970466136932373
And Albert followed by Franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand	57.06001663208008
Peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch	42.53407669067383
What are you going to do inquired the count	1145.0218505859375
I will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency	84.70027923583984
And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors	134.60462951660156
On reaching the door he bowed	297.2865295410156
And now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred	96.1385269165039
No my dear Vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them	177.34132385253906
20214 m	56.7415885925293
Gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever I may be you shall be welcome	56.49739074707031
Franz and Albert bowed	58.32170104980469
The count went out first then Albert	37.465415954589844
Franz paused for a moment	92.45419311523438
Has your excellency anything to ask me said Vampa with a smile	173.52662658691406
Yes I have replied Franz I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered	122.31587219238281
Csars Commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work	86.45914459228516
Well are you coming asked Albert	167.57737731933594
Yes replied Franz here I am and he in his turn left the caves	122.54927062988281
They advanced to the plain	124.033935546875
Ah your pardon said Albert turning round will you allow me captain	36.15713882446289
And he lighted his cigar at Vampas torch	103.71832275390625
Now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may	172.2797088623047
I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccianos	185.26504516601562
They found the carriage where they had left it	22.741676330566406
The count said a word in Arabic to Ali and the horses went on at great speed	36.29083251953125
It was just two oclock by Alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancingroom	100.7106704711914
Their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on Alberts account ceased instantly	74.7647705078125
Madame said the Viscount of Morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine	22.541093826293945
And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	152.9132843017578
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to Albert	98.33109283447266
Chapter 38	1.0714051723480225
The Rendezvous	25.208600997924805
The first words that Albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged	190.4695281982422
Franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to Alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	56.785301208496094
My dear count said Albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as I live I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life	76.02667236328125
My very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions	51.14959716796875
You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between usbut you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take	21.04588508605957
Upon my word said Albert I deserve no credit for what I could not help namely a determination to take everything as I found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself	103.85055541992188
All that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and I now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections I can in any way serve you My father the Comte de Morcerf although of Spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of France and Madrid and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal	45.64186477661133
Monsieur de Morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what I expected from you and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is madenay I will go still further and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands	50.668827056884766
Oh pray name it	101.89752197265625
I am wholly a stranger to Parisit is a city I have never yet seen	74.8377456665039
Is it possible exclaimed Albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world I can scarcely credit it	39.004356384277344
Nevertheless it is quite true still I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability I should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea	110.40727233886719
So distinguished an individual as yourself cried Albert could scarcely have required an introduction	90.26087951660156
You are most kind but as regards myself I can find no merit I possess save that as a millionaire I might have become a partner in the speculations of M	206.1759796142578
Aguado and M	6.8406243324279785
Rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution	128.34715270996094
Your offer however smooths all difficulties and I have only to ask you my dear M	247.5909423828125
de Morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in France to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or a native of CochinChina	30.671659469604492
Oh that I do and with infinite pleasure answered Albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to Paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear Franz do not smile I beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of Parisian society	78.40247344970703
Connected by marriage you mean said Franz laughingly	60.45646286010742
Well never mind how it is answered Albert it comes to the same thing in the end	241.5687255859375
Perhaps by the time you return to Paris I shall be quite a sober staid father of a family A most edifying representative I shall make of all the domestic virtuesdont you think so But as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please	112.74075317382812
Then it is settled said the count and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated	26.850788116455078
Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinxlike smile	40.537322998046875
But tell me now count exclaimed Albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind	202.93162536621094
I pledge you my honor returned the count that I mean to do as I have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris	35.99476623535156
When do you propose going thither	52.090938568115234
Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself	58.91277313232422
Certainly I have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as I can get there	72.54349517822266
Nay said the Count I will give you three months ere I join you you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties	91.49165344238281
And in three months time said Albert you will be at my house	74.69866943359375
Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements	34.057621002197266
Day for day hour for hour said Albert that will suit me to a dot	55.29869079589844
So be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the 21st of February and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten oclock	354.1672058105469
Now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon	154.02854919433594
Capital exclaimed Albert your breakfast shall be waiting	172.15530395507812
Where do you live	38.09901809692383
27 Rue du Helder	113.32268524169922
Have you bachelors apartments there I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience	37.83971405029297
I reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building	167.1551055908203
Quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down No	102.35508728027344
27 Rue du Helder 21st May halfpast ten in the morning	107.30281829833984
Now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself	152.57168579101562
Shall I see you again ere my departure asked Albert	33.04425048828125
That depends when do you leave	161.31826782226562
Tomorrow evening at five oclock	60.44233703613281
In that case I must say adieu to you as I am compelled to go to Naples and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning	124.92731475830078
And you baron pursued the count addressing Franz do you also depart tomorrow	157.6894989013672
For France	41.30034255981445
No for Venice I shall remain in Italy for another year or two	70.07978057861328
Then we shall not meet in Paris	227.8007049560547
I fear I shall not have that honor	101.10638427734375
Well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey	62.692588806152344
It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse	80.04769897460938
20219 m	70.8939208984375
Let us understand each other said Albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at No	55.32353591918945
27 in the Rue du Helder on the 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality	164.5925750732422
The 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning Rue du Helder No	129.96803283691406
27 replied the count	98.12644958496094
The young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room	144.61062622070312
What is the matter asked Albert of Franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful	120.7894287109375
I will confess to you Albert replied Franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions	57.99617385864258
My dear fellow exclaimed Albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness Why you must have lost your senses	117.07246398925781
Whether I am in my senses or not answered Franz that is the way I feel	94.2815170288086
Listen to me Franz said Albert I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us	49.28016662597656
Have you anything particular against him	1.2594844102859497
Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither	17.17235565185547
I have	53.43487548828125
And where	194.04095458984375
Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you	471.8893127441406
I promise	131.2412872314453
Upon your honor	21.742345809936523
Upon my honor	78.66824340820312
Then listen to me	55.17892074584961
Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two Corsican bandits with them	55.099308013916016
He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the Thousand and One Nights	62.72203826904297
He recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward PortoVecchio	100.80752563476562
Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum between the count and Vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	460.02154541015625
At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed	161.02508544921875
Albert listened with the most profound attention	174.43446350097656
Well said he when Franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related The count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own	335.1326904296875
Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement	74.46082305908203
Now by way of having a restingplace during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookerywhich has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many yearsand obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name	144.60614013671875
Just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of	54.932254791259766
But said Franz the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel	1050.4456787109375
Why really the thing seems to me simple enough	25.23458480834961
Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part I protest that should I ever go to Corsica my first visit ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of Colomba if I could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men I admire greatly	47.17683792114258
Still persisted Franz I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person	102.28701782226562
How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians	44.121604919433594
My good friend as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24000 livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly I should never have been estimated in France proving most indisputably added Albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country	78.71481323242188
Talking of countries replied Franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy Certainly these are questions that in your place I should like to have answered	47.401180267333984
My dear Franz replied Albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him	50.72578048706055
Was not that nearly what you said	61.41518783569336
20222 m	31.061100006103516
It was	61.29970932006836
Well then did he ask you Who is M	71.90623474121094
Albert de Morcerf how does he come by his namehis fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native Tell me did he put all these questions to you	276.0456848144531
I confess he asked me none	41.79265594482422
No he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa where I can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern I did not very particularly care to remain	105.91191101074219
Now then Franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse My good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such coldblooded policy	286.9962463378906
And this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on Alberts side	68.0799789428711
Well said Franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation	104.5154037475586
Still in spite of all you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage	67.16580200195312
He is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	91.57838439941406
If my vote and interest can obtain it for him I will readily give him the one and promise the other	32.35694122314453
And now my dear Franz let us talk of something else	47.510860443115234
Come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to St	148.03939819335938
Franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men parted	65.82550811767578
Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris and Franz dpinay to pass a fortnight at Venice	50.78901290893555
But ere he entered his travelling carriage Albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo on which beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf he had written in pencil	75.22589874267578
27 Rue du Helder on the 21st May halfpast ten A	111.23139953613281
Chapter 39	110.34595489501953
The Guests	96.60440826416016
In the house in the Rue du Helder where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion	109.11739349365234
Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	72.2388687133789
Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden	46.632347106933594
Between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf	87.0141372680664
A high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance	100.3105239868164
A small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	39.725215911865234
It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for Albert	1.8754334449768066
There were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage	83.1069107055664
By means of the two windows looking into the street Albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare	166.85919189453125
Then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierges door and which merits a particular description	128.6612548828125
It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another story	443.8705139160156
This door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the Arabian Nights opening at the Sesame of Ali Baba it was wo nt to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	24.446502685546875
At the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right Alberts breakfastroom looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden	179.68511962890625
Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate	26.09136199951172
On the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	363.4653015136719
The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan for the use of smokers	173.42677307128906
The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken	5.153049468994141
Above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitionsa pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for preeminence	203.1488800048828
There were collected and piled up all Alberts successive caprices huntinghorns bassviols flutesa whole orchestra for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxinggloves broadswords and singlesticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time Albert de Morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education i	116.74796295166016
fencing boxing and singlestick and it was here that he received Grisier Cooks and Charles Leboucher	282.3992919921875
The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases Lucca della Robbia faences and Palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat Henry IV	35.117401123046875
or Sully Louis XIII	33.98024368286133
or Richelieufor two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleurdelis of France on an azure field evidently came from the Louvre or at least some royal residence	23.824134826660156
Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath Persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of Chandernagor	526.56689453125
What these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections	93.09210205078125
In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefsduvre of Beethoven Weber Mozart Haydn Grtry and Porpora	39.08489990234375
On the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers Malay creeses maces battleaxes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flamecolored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open	49.0774040222168
This was Alberts favorite lounging place	395.02801513671875
However the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs	53.523704528808594
There on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco knownfrom the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico to Latakiawas exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of German pipes of chibouques with their amber mouthpieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers	92.34902954101562
Albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling	132.20587158203125
At a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named John and who only spoke English all Alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts chasseur also	70.40412902832031
This valet whose name was Germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to Albert	2.5534210205078125
Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention	93.04439544677734
How did these letters come said he	105.31021881103516
One by the post Madame Danglars footman left the other	38.95609664916992
Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box	59.84952926635742
Wait then during the day tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera I will sup with her as she wishes	58.047637939453125
Take her six bottles of different wineCyprus sherry and Malaga and a barrel of Ostend oysters get them at Borels and be sure you say they are for me	111.32543182373047
At what oclock sir do you breakfast	28.40057945251465
20227 m	71.54800415039062
What time is it now	20.12946891784668
A quarter to ten	64.96582794189453
Very well at half past ten	38.186004638671875
Debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the ministerand besides Albert looked at his tablets it is the hour I told the count 21st May at half past ten and though I do not much rely upon his promise I wish to be punctual	222.86094665527344
Is the countess up yet	37.762603759765625
If you wish I will inquire	136.86373901367188
Yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three oclock and that I request permission to introduce someone to her	21.066688537597656
The valet left the room	562.81396484375
Albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new toothpowder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of Paris muttering	94.16712951660156
These papers become more and more stupid every day	199.4501190185547
A moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced M	69.89109802246094
Lucien Debray	122.84626007080078
A tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eyeglass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a halfofficial air without smiling or speaking	40.80475616455078
Goodmorning Lucien goodmorning said Albert your punctuality really alarms me	257.9368591308594
What do I say punctuality You whom I expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast Has the ministry resigned	12.387263298034668
No my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us	30.79286003112793
Ah true you drive Don Carlos out of Spain	17.206642150878906
No no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	51.34737777709961
We take him to the other side of the French frontier and offer him hospitality at Bourges	398.3406677246094
At Bourges	48.11235046386719
Yes he has not much to complain of Bourges is the capital of Charles VII	55.184364318847656
Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the Bourse and M	81.7129898071289
Danglars I do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million	64.25328063964844
And you another order for I see you have a blue ribbon at your buttonhole	1.0454856157302856
Yes they sent me the order of Charles III	99.72001647949219
returned Debray carelessly	517.8310546875
Come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it	44.37934494018555
Oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	47.02775955200195
It looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up	81.85025787353516
And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt	172.56130981445312
It is for that reason you see me so early	24.16670036315918
Because you have the order of Charles III	205.8338623046875
and you wish to announce the good news to me	91.12284088134766
No because I passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	47.4681396484375
I returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour	42.8511962890625
At the Bois de Boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at oncetwo enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of Carlorepublican alliance	40.093780517578125
I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here I am	69.59352111816406
I am hungry feed me I am bored amuse me	98.24185943603516
It is my duty as your host returned Albert ringing the bell while Lucien turned over with his goldmounted cane the papers that lay on the table	63.85669708251953
Germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit	329.6174011230469
In the meantime my dear Lucien here are cigarscontraband of coursetry them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves	892.77783203125
Peste I will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable	73.85984802246094
Besides that does not concern the home but the financial department	69.20416259765625
Address yourself to M	31.39388084411621
Humann section of the indirect contributions corridor A	138.92030334472656
On my word said Albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge	148.04286193847656
Take a cigar	46.35057067871094
Really my dear Albert replied Lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standhow happy you are to have nothing to do	37.493934631347656
You do not know your own good fortune	56.34646224975586
And what would you do my dear diplomatist replied Morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing What private secretary to a minister plunged at once into European cabals and Parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battlefields with his sword and his victories possessing fiveandtwenty thousand francs a year besides your place a horse for which ChteauRenaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockeyclub and other diversions can you not amuse yourself Well I will amuse you	201.54298400878906
By introducing to you a new acquaintance	53.02470779418945
A man or a woman	1.8878616094589233
A man	3055.44091796875
I know so many men already	105.24520874023438
But you do not know this man	15.384852409362793
Where does he come fromthe end of the world	38.073524475097656
Farther still perhaps	92.56121063232422
The deuce I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him	37.58314514160156
Oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen	17.64976692199707
Are you hungry	48.09409713745117
Humiliating as such a confession is I am	47.07080078125
But I dined at M	26.841333389282227
de Villeforts and lawyers always give you very bad dinners	482.92279052734375
You would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that	5716.3994140625
Ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones	54.74249267578125
Yes but we do not invite people of fashion	200.71578979492188
If we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home I assure you	140.73904418945312
Well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit	37.16086196899414
Your Spanish wine is excellent	145.80279541015625
You see we were quite right to pacify that country	106.68650817871094
Yes but Don Carlos	48.1002082824707
Well Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen	104.00299072265625
You will then obtain the Golden Fleece if you are still in the ministry	119.55862426757812
I think Albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning	50.88626480102539
Well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but I hear Beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time	172.04885864257812
About what	60.811798095703125
About the papers	48.77360916137695
My dear friend said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do I ever read the papers	60.17277145385742
Then you will dispute the more	106.00796508789062
Beauchamp announced the servant	65.01216125488281
Come in come in said Albert rising and advancing to meet the young man	97.67125701904297
Here is Debray who detests you without reading you so he says	42.657989501953125
He is quite right returned Beauchamp for I criticise him without knowing what he does	56.41996383666992
Goodday commander	82.2072982788086
Ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	106.88907623291016
And what do they say of it in the world	431.34320068359375
In which world we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838	137.31361389160156
In the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders	37.21781921386719
They say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue	117.94252014160156
Come come that is not bad said Lucien	72.99353790283203
Why do you not join our party my dear Beauchamp With your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years	172.3670654296875
I only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will hold office for six months	249.7150421142578
My dear Albert one word for I must give poor Lucien a respite	96.68338775634766
Do we breakfast or dine I must go to the Chamber for our life is not an idle one	1.961243987083435
You only breakfast I await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table	58.87281036376953
Chapter 40	36.32832336425781
The Breakfast	131.0734405517578
And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said Beauchamp	132.5474853515625
A gentleman and a diplomatist	244.267822265625
Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist	158.08030700683594
I shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars	245.34352111816406
I shall take a cutlet on my way to the Chamber	144.36343383789062
Do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a Montmorency and the diplomatist a Metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow Debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit	17.88368797302246
Be it so I will stay I must do something to distract my thoughts	47.416099548339844
You are like Debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous	69.06217956542969
Ah you do not know with what I am threatened	153.4290008544922
I shall hear this morning that M	926.7333984375
Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies and at his wifes this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France	390.75115966796875
The devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that	61.231407165527344
I understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity	94.86613464355469
Do not run down M	88.1571273803711
Danglars speeches said Debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition	59.79205322265625
Pardieu that is exactly the worst of all	189.1759033203125
I am waiting until you send him to speak at the Luxembourg to laugh at my ease	97.7232894897461
My dear friend said Albert to Beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of Spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning	48.62179183959961
Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and Mlle	85.22118377685547
Eugnie Danglars I can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me Vicomte you know I give my daughter two millions	97.50945281982422
Ah this marriage will never take place said Beauchamp	34.111873626708984
The king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a msalliance	394.8771667480469
The Viscount of Morcerf can only we d a marchioness	58.766929626464844
But two million francs make a nice little sum replied Morcerf	62.335594177246094
It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Rpe	171.8468475341797
Never mind what he says Morcerf said Debray do you marry her	56.030975341796875
You marry a moneybag label it is true well but what does that matter It is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it	84.73614501953125
You have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than M	160.85971069335938
de Guise had who so nearly became King of France and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany	75.23877716064453
On my word I think you are right Lucien said Albert absently	66.92063903808594
To be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardthat is he can be	71.57894897460938
Do not say that Debray returned Beauchamp laughing for here is ChteauRenaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban his ancestor through your body	67.59669494628906
He will sully it then returned Lucien for I am lowvery low	130.6551513671875
Oh heavens cried Beauchamp the minister quotes Branger what shall we come to next	60.71036148071289
de ChteauRenaudM	216.41796875
Maximilian Morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests	170.61044311523438
Now then to breakfast said Beauchamp for if I remember you told me you only expected two persons Albert	38.66265106201172
Morrel muttered AlbertMorrelwho is he	20.274639129638672
But before he had finished M	24.099985122680664
de ChteauRenaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all overthat is with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemarttook Alberts hand	53.108970642089844
My dear Albert said he let me introduce to you M	136.45587158203125
Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis my friend and what is morehowever the man speaks for himselfmy preserver	93.11416625976562
Salute my hero viscount	57.56480026245117
And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten	31.931758880615234
A rich uniform half French half Oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor	97.52489471435547
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	94.76897430419922
Monsieur said Albert with affectionate courtesy the count of ChteauRenaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also	214.64370727539062
Well said interrupted ChteauRenaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me	69.52294158935547
What has he done asked Albert	136.28408813476562
Oh nothing worth speaking of said Morrel M	149.28260803222656
de ChteauRenaud exaggerates	67.13113403320312
Not worth speaking of cried ChteauRenaud life is not worth speaking ofthat is rather too philosophical on my word Morrel	246.861328125
It is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once	115.23077392578125
We gather from all this baron that Captain Morrel saved your life	1.2509634494781494
Exactly so	39.849212646484375
On what occasion asked Beauchamp	182.06588745117188
Beauchamp my good fellow you know I am starving said Debray do not set him off on some long story	22.31850814819336
Well I do not prevent your sitting down to table replied Beauchamp ChteauRenaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast	289.8187255859375
Gentlemen said Morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and I expect someone else	1039.2515869140625
Ah true a diplomatist observed Debray	14.876898765563965
Diplomat or not I do nt know I only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had I been king I should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had I been able to offer him the Golden Fleece and the Garter	182.48300170898438
Well since we are not to sit down to table said Debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it	39.549598693847656
You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa	43.34840393066406
It is a road your ancestors have traced for you said Albert gallantly	49.4517822265625
Yes but I doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the Holy Sepulchre	185.72755432128906
You are quite right Beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	42.439884185791016
It was only to fight as an amateur	26.702363967895508
I can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom I had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor Franz dpinay	53.7670783996582
Ah true said Debray you did fight some time ago about what	139.54502868652344
20235 m	71.89057159423828
The devil take me if I remember returned ChteauRenaud	85.76934051513672
But I recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols that had been given to me	58.25596618652344
In consequence I embarked for Oran and went from thence to Constantine where I arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege	99.84143829345703
I retreated with the rest for eightandforty hours	109.00849151611328
I endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold	39.92595672607422
Poor bruteaccustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia	145.78424072265625
That s why you want to purchase my English horse said Debray you think he will bear the cold better	190.15426635742188
You are mistaken for I have made a vow never to return to Africa	165.37417602539062
You were very much frightened then asked Beauchamp	125.54879760742188
Well yes and I had good reason to be so replied ChteauRenaud	57.758975982666016
I was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	69.8819351196289
Six Arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	44.35234069824219
I shot two with my doublebarrelled gun and two more with my pistols but I was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why I now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and I already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre	6.9447455406188965
He had assigned himself the task of saving a mans life that day chance caused that man to be myself	50.54560089111328
When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti	203.40225219726562
Yes said Morrel smiling it was the 5th of September the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power I endeavor to celebrate it by some	65.0419921875
20237 m	73.7945785522461
Heroic action interrupted ChteauRenaud	51.53499984741211
I was chosen	80.49288940429688
But that is not allafter rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like St	247.24325561523438
Martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with meguess what	48.198978424072266
A Strasbourg pie asked Beauchamp	18.263248443603516
No his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite	53.283626556396484
It was very hard	121.49299621582031
The horse said Morcerf laughing	78.21696472167969
No the sacrifice returned ChteauRenaud ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger	47.511192321777344
Not for a stranger said Debray but for a friend I might perhaps	40.36067581176758
I divined that you would become mine count replied Morrel besides as I had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us	113.83460235595703
The history to which M	14.099544525146484
Morrel alludes continued ChteauRenaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	76.67314147949219
What time do you breakfast Albert	36.10491180419922
At halfpast ten	289.25048828125
Precisely asked Debray taking out his watch	30.431201934814453
Oh you will give me five minutes grace replied Morcerf for I also expect a preserver	33.53101348876953
Of whom	54.11310958862305
Of myself cried Morcerf parbleu do you think I can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads Our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at tableat least I hope sotwo benefactors of humanity	65.96350860595703
What shall we do said Debray we have only one Monthyon prize	86.57746887207031
Well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said Beauchamp that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the dilemma	165.40887451171875
And where does he come from asked Debray	75.3252944946289
You have already answered the question once but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second time	30.917903900146484
Really said Albert I do not know when I invited him three months ago he was then at Rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone	86.68155670166016
And you think him capable of being exact demanded Debray	393.6304016113281
I think him capable of everything	326.8984375
Well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left	68.99151611328125
I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest	43.73992156982422
I beg pardon interrupted Beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us	1.9045026302337646
Yes and for a most curious one	56.261566162109375
Go on then for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning and I must make up for it	164.62734985351562
I was at Rome during the last Carnival	128.56668090820312
We know that said Beauchamp	289.3117370605469
Yes but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits	186.123046875
There are no bandits cried Debray	23.293914794921875
Yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for I found them ugly enough to frighten me	235.53314208984375
Come my dear Albert said Debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes and that like Madame de Maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story	84.39363861083984
Say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be	45.042564392089844
And I say to you fabulous as it may seem I tell it as a true one from beginning to end	123.38082122802734
The brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian	82.03046417236328
I know it said ChteauRenaud I narrowly escaped catching a fever there	273.88818359375
And I did more than that replied Morcerf for I caught one	159.18931579589844
I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4000 Roman crownsabout 24000 francs	65.36678314208984
Unfortunately I had not above 1500	54.01675796508789
I was at the end of my journey and of my credit	20.37029457092285
I wrote to Franzand were he here he would confirm every wordI wrote then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being and Signor Luigi Vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word	169.90567016601562
But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns said ChteauRenaud	43.82427215576172
A man whose name is Franz dpinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them	22.659711837768555
No he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you	90.48544311523438
Ah this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus a Perseus freeing Andromeda	44.51774597167969
No he is a man about my own size	50.578651428222656
Armed to the teeth	49.80243682861328
He had not even a knittingneedle	75.29707336425781
But he paid your ransom	33.10514831542969
He said two words to the chief and I was free	208.21141052246094
And they apologized to him for having carried you off said Beauchamp	40.74595642089844
Just so	193.95013427734375
Why he is a second Ariosto	344.9623718261719
No his name is the Count of Monte Cristo	112.45722198486328
There is no Count of Monte Cristo said Debray	945.8109130859375
I do not think so added ChteauRenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly	38.726234436035156
Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo	73.74241638183594
He comes possibly from the Holy Land and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea	52.985076904296875
I think I can assist your researches said Maximilian	179.33656311035156
Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean an atom in the infinite	291.9826354980469
Precisely cried Albert	176.44906616210938
Well he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tuscany	176.69677734375
He is rich then	54.21261978149414
I believe so	60.752872467041016
But that ought to be visible	855.7239990234375
That is what deceives you Debray	78.10533905029297
I do not understand you	53.15764236450195
Have you read the Arabian Nights	57.57295227050781
What a question	202.0831298828125
Well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds They seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the Indies	113.65447998046875
Which means	191.14334106445312
Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen	48.312015533447266
He has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor and has a cave filled with gold	140.9953155517578
And you have seen this cavern Morcerf asked Beauchamp	164.11936950683594
No but Franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	158.82264709472656
Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet	323.0867004394531
Only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues	60.68720245361328
The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to sayAre you mad or are you laughing at us	50.71294021606445
And I also said Morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penelon	121.43734741210938
Ah cried Albert it is very lucky that M	109.57685852050781
Morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth	428.1783447265625
My dear Albert said Debray what you tell us is so extraordinary	106.25948333740234
Ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no time	160.69195556640625
They are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel	133.74392700195312
Now you get angry and attack our poor agents	77.54856872558594
How will you have them protect you The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any	1518.8060302734375
Will you be ambassador Albert I will send you to Constantinople	2.524933338165283
No lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali the Sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me	75.08560180664062
You say very true responded Debray	90.9395751953125
Yes said Albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Cristo	45.4361686706543
Pardieu everyone exists	95.64415740966797
Doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and Greek mistresses	94.23131561279297
Have you seen the Greek mistress	184.4364013671875
I have both seen and heard her	67.72830200195312
I saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when I breakfasted with the count	66.81475067138672
He eats then	67.92568969726562
Yes but so little it can hardly be called eating	60.047943115234375
He must be a vampire	174.3592071533203
Laugh if you will the Countess G who knew Lord Ruthven declared that the count was a vampire	56.035865783691406
Ah capital said Beauchamp	74.47247314453125
For a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaserpent of the Constitutionnel	66.65017700195312
Wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said Debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable	160.4325714111328
Just so Lucien returned Morcerf you have described him feature for feature	118.56029510498047
Yes keen and cutting politeness	331.04827880859375
This man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution I thought I should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit	55.770259857177734
Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your blood asked Beauchamp	37.87430953979492
Or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birthright	104.22664642333984
Rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said Morcerf somewhat piqued	98.7442398071289
When I look at you Parisians idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race	56.514068603515625
I am highly flattered returned Beauchamp	74.11669158935547
At the same time added ChteauRenaud your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditti	261.27581787109375
There are no Italian banditti said Debray	69.755615234375
No vampire cried Beauchamp	55.29228210449219
No Count of Monte Cristo added Debray	237.6907958984375
There is halfpast ten striking Albert	201.86268615722656
20243 m	49.11321258544922
Confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued Beauchamp	14.166172981262207
But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo	169.77310180664062
The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerfs narrative had impressed them and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	72.46187591552734
He had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	24.605297088623047
The count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet	141.36793518066406
Every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first makers	17.600322723388672
He seemed scarcely fiveandthirty	40.15096664428711
But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn	60.53379821777344
The count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached Albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner	65.34854888916016
Punctuality said Monte Cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns I think but it is not the same with travellers	78.76549530029297
However I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in France where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions	20.38395881652832
My dear count replied Albert I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom I now present to you	19.856300354003906
They are the Count of ChteauRenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table M	274.59173583984375
Lucien Debray private secretary to the minister of the interior M	32.380226135253906
Beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the French government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in Italy since his paper is prohibited there and M	83.2992935180664
Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis	56.02034378051758
At this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks	60.385009765625
You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform	92.26887512207031
No one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased	76.11213684082031
You have never seen our Africans count said Albert	118.22879791259766
Never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again	28.458410263061523
Well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army	63.270999908447266
Oh M	58.82533264160156
de Morcerf interrupted Morrel	248.40855407714844
Let me go on captain	81.89636993408203
And we have just heard continued Albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although I have seen him today for the first time I request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend	30.73004913330078
At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion	105.4875259399414
Ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better	84.41919708251953
This exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what Albert was saying surprised everybody and especially Morrel who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder	158.99928283691406
But at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	168.81103515625
20245 m	221.9506072998047
Why should he doubt it said Beauchamp to ChteauRenaud	34.26114273071289
In reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo Albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being	114.07884979248047
What say you Morrel	282.5121765136719
Ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me	102.77877807617188
Gentlemen said Albert Germain informs me that breakfast is ready	50.7902717590332
My dear count allow me to show you the way	35.84012985229492
They passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	177.58494567871094
Gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may commit	442.52349853515625
I am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time I have ever been at Paris	137.65870666503906
The French way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian	60.23316955566406
I beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish too Italian or too Arabian	682.9981079101562
Now then let us breakfast	37.209407806396484
With what an air he says all this muttered Beauchamp decidedly he is a great man	46.340328216552734
A great man in his own country added Debray	40.29121398925781
A great man in every country M	53.586605072021484
Debray said ChteauRenaud	43.51828384399414
The count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest	76.18122863769531
Albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	58.849342346191406
My dear count said he I fear one thing and that is that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Spagna	112.9897232055664
I ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly	64.81233215332031
Did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples polenta at Milan olla podrida at Valencia pilau at Constantinople curry in India and swallows nests in China	31.619861602783203
I eat everywhere and of everything only I eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for I have not eaten since yesterday morning	25.30852699279785
What cried all the guests you have not eaten for fourandtwenty hours	301.7997131347656
No replied the count I was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near Nmes so that I was somewhat late and therefore I did not choose to stop	49.32638931274414
And you ate in your carriage asked Morcerf	139.33712768554688
No I slept as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to eat	66.00545501708984
But you can sleep when you please monsieur said Morrel	75.20308685302734
You have a recipe for it	41.56779098510742
An infallible one	52.7664909362793
That would be invaluable to us in Africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink	86.3600082397461
Yes said Monte Cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed	65.43111419677734
May we inquire what is this recipe asked Debray	510.498779296875
Oh yes returned Monte Cristo I make no secret of it	71.28038024902344
It is a mixture of excellent opium which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the Eastthat is between the Tigris and the Euphrates	35.08805465698242
These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills	38.46479034423828
Ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced	20.804351806640625
Ask Baron Franz dpinay I think he tasted them one day	83.79428100585938
Yes replied Morcerf he said something about it to me	1.0622365474700928
But said Beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you	75.7781753540039
Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued Beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage	61.72774887084961
No monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea	79.248779296875
This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	102.16033935546875
There were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	68.17473602294922
The casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	38.20064926147461
And is it your cook who prepares these pills asked Beauchamp	65.68748474121094
Oh no monsieur replied Monte Cristo I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar	59.53656768798828
I am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself	262.280517578125
This is a magnificent emerald and the largest I have ever seen said ChteauRenaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels	182.79225158691406
I had three similar ones returned Monte Cristo	68.4807357788086
I gave one to the Sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the Pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor Pius VII	25.21875
I kept the third for myself and I had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I intended	47.0823860168457
Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad	105.7154312133789
However the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief	30.557233810424805
And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked Debray	71.72734069824219
The Sultan the liberty of a woman replied the Count the Pope the life of a man so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne	10.848419189453125
And it was Peppino you saved was it not cried Morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon	56.500728607177734
Perhaps returned the count smiling	144.4934539794922
My dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said Morcerf	66.13814544677734
I had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the Arabian Nights a wizard of the Middle Ages but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence	19.67839813232422
For example here is Debray who reads and Beauchamp who prints every day A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St	74.49261474609375
Denis or the Faubourg St	18.366409301757812
Germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the Boulevard du Temple or in the Thermes de Julienand yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma the Campagna di Romana or the Pontine Marshes	45.47038650512695
Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St	61.8082160949707
Sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder	32.6716423034668
Ah said Monte Cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance	33.976524353027344
It was not I who made that promise cried Morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten	75.24824523925781
Pray speak of it for I shall not only I trust relate the little I do know but also a great deal I do not know	19.852521896362305
It seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened	64.08724975585938
20249 m	106.54568481445312
Well you promise me if I tell all I know to relate in your turn all that I do not know	99.1523666381836
That is but fair replied Monte Cristo	163.8507080078125
Well said Morcerf for three days I believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or Poppa while I was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and I say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl	11.102455139160156
What I know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as I was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the Catacombs of St	54.52327346801758
Sebastian where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Csars Commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oclock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankers at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist	61.302223205566406
The letter is still to be seen for it is in Franz dpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of M	57.840911865234375
Luigi Vampa	50.97356033325195
This is all I know but I know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	54.185638427734375
I assure you Franz and I were lost in admiration	50.65190505981445
Nothing more simple returned the count	269.50299072265625
I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten years	37.388755798339844
When he was quite a child and only a shepherd I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms	1658.5953369140625
In after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was I who captured him and a dozen of his band	73.37899017333984
I might have handed him over to Roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but I did nothing of the sortI suffered him and his band to depart	30.93401527404785
With the condition that they should sin no more said Beauchamp laughing	19.048786163330078
I see they kept their promise	73.90811157226562
No monsieur returned Monte Cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends	21.016845703125
Perhaps what I am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but I never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which I will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me	126.58484649658203
Bravo cried ChteauRenaud you are the first man I ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	162.2733917236328
Bravo count bravo	8.257943153381348
It is frank at least said Morrel	675.202880859375
But I am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed	93.31703186035156
How have I deviated from those principles monsieur asked Monte Cristo who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	65.31262969970703
Why it seems to me replied Morrel that in delivering M	61.45139694213867
de Morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society	116.38211059570312
Of which he is the brightest ornament said Beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne	36.366722106933594
My dear count cried Morcerf you are at faultyou one of the most formidable logicians I knowand you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist	14.786599159240723
Ah you call yourself Oriental a Levantine Maltese Indian Chinese your family name is Monte Cristo Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric Parisiansthat is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess	48.060604095458984
My dear vicomte returned Monte Cristo I do not see in all I have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies I have received	119.61930084228516
You were no stranger to me for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the Carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted	337.26885986328125
I will appeal to any of these gentlemen could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him Besides you know I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to France	49.1329231262207
You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word	73.56744384765625
I will keep it returned Morcerf but I fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons	203.10142517089844
Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our Chimborazo is Mortmartre our Himalaya is Mount Valrien our Great Desert is the plain of Grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans	99.75892639160156
We have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord	11.199536323547363
France is so prosaic and Paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eightyfive departmentsI say eightyfive because I do not include Corsicayou will not find then in these eightyfive departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp	45.65943145751953
There is but one service I can render you and for that I place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce youwith your name and your fortune and your talent Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received	96.97843170166016
I can be useful in one way onlyif knowledge of Parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here	56.29076385498047
I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as I shared yours at RomeI who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine	104.6077880859375
Ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage	114.37003326416016
May I congratulate you	87756.84375
The affair is still in projection	117.49195098876953
And he who says in projection means already decided said Debray	1.1138677597045898
No replied Morcerf my father is most anxious about it and I hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedMademoiselle Eugnie Danglars	41.95466613769531
Eugnie Danglars said Monte Cristo tell me is not her father Baron Danglars	211.07073974609375
Yes returned Morcerf a baron of a new creation	78.61983489990234
What matter said Monte Cristo if he has rendered the State services which merit this distinction	37.005271911621094
Enormous ones answered Beauchamp	52.19801712036133
Although in reality a Liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X	66.7580337524414
in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoatpocket but at his buttonhole	272.3326110839844
Ah interrupted Morcerf laughing Beauchamp Beauchamp keep that for the Corsaire or the Charivari but spare my future fatherinlaw before me	18.110002517700195
Then turning to Monte Cristo You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron	47.61853790283203
I do not know him returned Monte Cristo but I shall probably soon make his acquaintance for I have a credit opened with him by the house of Richard   Blount of London Arstein   Eskeles of Vienna and Thomson   French at Rome	209.677490234375
As he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel	154.0671844482422
If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel he was not mistakenMaximilian started as if he had been electrified	42.07896423339844
Thomson   French said he do you know this house monsieur	61.9862174987793
20253 m	81.71015167236328
They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world returned the count quietly	39.69013977050781
Can my influence with them be of any service to you	73.01188659667969
Oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless	116.23204803466797
This house in past years did ours a great service and has I know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service	83.78900909423828
I shall be at your orders said Monte Cristo bowing	54.1701774597168
But continued Morcerf   propos of Danglarswe have strangely wandered from the subject	232.9840850830078
We were speaking of a suitable habitation for the Count of Monte Cristo	37.41019058227539
Come gentlemen let us all propose some place	90.7388916015625
Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital	49.81913375854492
Faubourg SaintGermain said ChteauRenaud	64.99359130859375
The count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden	62.14902877807617
Bah ChteauRenaud returned Debray you only know your dull and gloomy Faubourg SaintGermain do not pay any attention to him countlive in the Chausse dAntin that s the real centre of Paris	36.35565185546875
Boulevard de lOpra said Beauchamp the second floora house with a balcony	43.87646484375
The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all Paris pass before him	156.47279357910156
You have no idea then Morrel asked ChteauRenaud you do not propose anything	88.32842254638672
Oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary I have one but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the Pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the Rue Meslay	70.99107360839844
You have a sister asked the count	53.665313720703125
Yes monsieur a most excellent sister	112.48612213134766
Nearly nine years	19.37822723388672
Happy asked the count again	81.07678985595703
As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied Maximilian	128.79598999023438
She married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesEmmanuel Herbaut	137.54074096679688
Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly	310.6035461425781
I live there during my leave of absence continued Maximilian and I shall be together with my brotherinlaw Emmanuel at the disposition of the Count whenever he thinks fit to honor us	84.98143768310547
One minute cried Albert without giving Monte Cristo the time to reply	113.42232513427734
Take care you are going to immure a traveller Sinbad the Sailor a man who comes to see Paris you are going to make a patriarch of him	155.99014282226562
20255 m	29.077531814575195
Oh no said Morrel my sister is fiveandtwenty my brotherinlaw is thirty they are gay young and happy	68.22390747070312
Besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so	61.54661560058594
Thanks monsieur said Monte Cristo I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but I can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared	134.71719360351562
What cried Morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for you	21.20808219909668
Was I so badly lodged at Rome said Monte Cristo smiling	69.98513793945312
Parbleu at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day	42.03019332885742
It is not that which deterred me replied Monte Cristo but as I determined to have a house to myself I sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it	50.8524169921875
But you have then a valet de chambre who knows Paris said Beauchamp	332.4403381347656
It is the first time he has ever been in Paris	1.0454856157302856
He is black and can not speak returned Monte Cristo	26.074155807495117
It is Ali cried Albert in the midst of the general surprise	1.0454856157302856
Yes Ali himself my Nubian mute whom you saw I think at Rome	186.74615478515625
Certainly said Morcerf I recollect him perfectly	114.84164428710938
But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything wrong	165.65869140625
Undeceive yourself monsieur replied Monte Cristo I am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as I wish	70.66114807128906
He knows my tastes my caprices my wants	79.4982681274414
He has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself	180.60354614257812
He will arrange everything for me	70.719970703125
He knew that I should arrive today at ten oclock he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrire de Fontainebleau	35.10224914550781
He gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert	13.721586227416992
Ah that is really original said Beauchamp	42.761558532714844
And very princely added ChteauRenaud	60.89295196533203
What do you not know your house asked Debray	139.30422973632812
No said Monte Cristo I told you I did not wish to be behind my time I dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door	346.50262451171875
The young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	101.69549560546875
We must content ourselves then said Beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	49.3323974609375
I in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him	181.1171112060547
Thanks monsieur returned Monte Cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre	1.069966197013855
Is your steward also a Nubian asked Debray	5491.92138671875
No he is a countryman of yours if a Corsican is a countryman of anyones	1562.2291259765625
But you know him M	89.40984344482422
de Morcerf	50.26780700683594
Is it that excellent M	31.0975341796875
Bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well	69.05964660644531
Yes you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact everything	102.28472900390625
I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some triflea stab with a knife for instance	109.46463012695312
And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said Debray	141.75465393066406
Of how much does he rob you every year	946.1726684570312
On my word replied the count not more than another	43.11714172363281
I am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so I keep him	111.517333984375
Then continued ChteauRenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the Champslyses you only want a mistress	92.11676788330078
Albert smiled	272.67449951171875
He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the counts box at the Argentina and Valle theatres	49.153594970703125
I have something better than that said Monte Cristo I have a slave	65.19501495361328
You procure your mistresses from the opera the Vaudeville or the Varits I purchased mine at Constantinople it cost me more but I have nothing to fear	58.025386810302734
But you forget replied Debray laughing that we are Franks by name and franks by nature as King Charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free	28.887178421020508
Who will tell her	106.0400619506836
The first person who sees her	23.25694465637207
She only speaks Romaic	112.5803451538086
That is different	36.089351654052734
But at least we shall see her said Beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes	124.00194549560547
Oh no replied Monte Cristo I do not carry brutalism so far	58.76409912109375
Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me	38.8915901184082
They had long since passed to dessert and cigars	258.1567687988281
My dear Albert said Debray rising it is halfpast two	189.77987670898438
Your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes	92.84783172607422
I must return to the ministers	85.79560089111328
I will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is	102.22830963134766
Take care returned Albert no one has been able to accomplish that	64.66561126708984
Oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose	113.53130340576172
And when you know will you tell me	127.04266357421875
I promise you	29.15020179748535
Au revoir Albert	102.61780548095703
Gentlemen good morning	33.39234161376953
As he left the room Debray called out loudly My carriage	34.15006637573242
Bravo said Beauchamp to Albert I shall not go to the Chamber but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M	523.6348876953125
For heavens sake Beauchamp returned Morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	58.91268539428711
Is he not peculiar	5.889016151428223
He is more than that replied ChteauRenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my life	337.6914367675781
Are you coming Morrel	99.43223571777344
Directly I have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay No	95.00688171386719
Be sure I shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing	36.548431396484375
And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChteauRenaud leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf	96.85504150390625
Chapter 41	82.60346221923828
The Presentation	62.431766510009766
When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo My dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelors apartment	97.20588684082031
You who are accustomed to the palaces of Italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live	67.12520599365234
As we pass from one room to another I will open the windows to let you breathe	22.351512908935547
Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground floor	58.818458557128906
Albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment	93.13330078125
Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected hereold cabinets Japanese porcelain Oriental stuffs Venetian glass arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin	65.85162353515625
Morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archology mineralogy and natural history	76.42489624023438
They descended to the first floor Albert led his guest into the salon	88.97713470458984
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by Dupr with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies Delacroixs Arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces aquarelles of Boulanger representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by Diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by Decamp as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa but more poetic pastels by Giraud and Mller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of Dauzats Travels in the East that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosquein a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past	55.192237854003906
Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him	43.402469635009766
From the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance	64.6340103149414
A single portrait signed by Lopold Robert shone in its carved and gilded frame	18.826580047607422
This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it	98.28876495361328
It was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes	198.70730590820312
She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	23.33754539489746
She was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky	115.21105194091797
The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders	79.4601821899414
Silence prevailed for an instant during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture	52.30580139160156
You have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admirably	120.69328308105469
Ah monsieur returned Albert I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this	69.63906860351562
You do not know my mother she it is whom you see here	445.5567932128906
She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago	215.24954223632812
This costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830	26.48673439025879
The countess had this portrait painted during the counts absence	180.3293914794922
She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of Lopold Robert could not overcome his dislike to it	93.32677459716797
It is true between ourselves that M	76.0096435546875
de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art	134.98153686523438
It is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease M	88.20699310302734
de Morcerf whose portrait by Gros I will also show you	307.57977294921875
Excuse my talking of family matters but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	51.21846389770508
The picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping	109.76402282714844
This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding	84.13347625732422
20261 m	22.886070251464844
Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart	52.3881950378418
Now said Albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are	29.277292251586914
Consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of M	89.64122772216797
de Morcerf he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom I announced your promised visit and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person	123.52552032470703
You are somewhat blas I know and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor who has seen so many others	62.6079216003418
However accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions	71.28323364257812
Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	104.8511962890625
Albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint M	76.38874816894531
and Madame de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo	32.182918548583984
Albert followed him with the count	129.04624938964844
When they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon	78.83181762695312
Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively	58.26580047607422
Azure seven merlets or placed bender said he	149.3844451904297
These are doubtless your family arms Except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them I am very ignorant of heraldryI a count of a fresh creation fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery of St	149.08314514160156
Stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been told that when you travel much it is necessary	115.28693389892578
Besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the customhouse officers	59.837799072265625
Excuse my putting such a question to you	68.70222473144531
It is not indiscreet returned Morcerf with the simplicity of conviction	25.4679012298584
You have guessed rightly	46.20096206665039
These are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my mothers	86.73787689208984
By her side I am Spanish but the family of Morcerf is French and I have heard one of the oldest of the south of France	211.63906860351562
Yes replied Monte Cristo these blazons prove that	80.17793273925781
Almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith	67.60572052001953
One of your ancestors had joined the Crusades and supposing it to be only that of St	80.7596206665039
Louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient	1.0454856157302856
It is possible said Morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which I made commentaries that would have greatly edified dHozier and Jaucourt	162.0285186767578
At present I no longer think of it and yet I must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government	219.3325958251953
Well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever	44.98484420776367
As for you viscount continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination	45.64857864379883
Yes you are at once from Provence and Spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue I so much admired on the visage of the noble Catalan	349.8339538574219
It would have required the penetration of dipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness	147.01943969726562
Morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon	39.59965515136719
In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait	1.2620187997817993
It was that of a man from five to eightandthirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the Saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of Charles III	37.222511291503906
which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of Greece and Spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	26.48159408569336
Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person	5.889016151428223
He was a man of forty to fortyfive years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion	63.75605392456055
He was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his buttonhole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged	74.33765411376953
He entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	30.229738235473633
Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	182.03958129882812
It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf	121.86270904541016
Father said the young man I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo the generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you	61.11860275268555
You are most welcome monsieur said the Count of Morcerf saluting Monte Cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude	58.79566192626953
As he said these words the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	81.31826782226562
Monte Cristo in taking the seat Morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there	128.7108917236328
The countess said Morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive	334.29461669921875
She will however be in the salon in ten minutes	31.900707244873047
It is a great honor to me returned Monte Cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in Paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja or in the mountains of Atlas a marshals staff to offer you	29.428709030151367
Oh replied Morcerf reddening slightly I have left the service monsieur	1.7243731021881104
Made a peer at the Restoration I served through the first campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont	39.33577346801758
I could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne But the Revolution of July was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	240.78924560546875
I tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battlefield you do not know how to manuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons	261.1742858886719
I have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	148.0496368408203
I have devoted myself to industry I study the useful arts	2003.75341796875
During the twenty years I served I often wished to do so but I had not the time	76.20248413085938
These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned Monte Cristo	46.662899017333984
A gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by stepthis is uncommon then become general peer of France commander of the Legion of Honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellowcreatures this indeed is praiseworthynay more it is sublime	131.29241943359375
20265 m	146.6514434814453
Albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm	60.53524398803711
Alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered Morcerfs brow we do not act thus in Italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives	109.5771713256836
But monsieur said the Count of Morcerf for a man of your merit Italy is not a country and France opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	39.834415435791016
France will not perhaps be always ungrateful	179.24183654785156
She treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers	50.88294219970703
Ah father said Albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport	154.4001922607422
That is the most just remark replied the stranger I ever heard made concerning myself	82.7053451538086
You have been free to choose your career observed the Count of Morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers	187.23583984375
Precisely monsieur replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze	137.3125
If I did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the counts manners I would have taken you to the Chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators	246.9619903564453
I shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but I have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and I will therefore wait	92.69512939453125
Ah here is my mother cried the viscount	80.84573364257812
Monte Cristo turned round hastily and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when Monte Cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded doorpost	71.47966003417969
She had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor	37.63823699951172
The latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking	85.65518951416016
Ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you	158.39088439941406
Are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	76.73312377929688
She thanked them both with a smile	46.79433059692383
No returned she but I feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation	62.72829055786133
Monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen I owe to you the life of my son and for this I bless you	248.93051147460938
Now I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you from the bottom of my heart	218.28890991210938
The count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than Mercds	45.210426330566406
Madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action	49.742191314697266
To save a man to spare a fathers feelings or a mothers sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity	77.79820251464844
At these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness Madame de Morcerf replied	1.1639456748962402
It is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and I thank God that things are thus	22.09271812438965
And Mercds raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them	89.31822967529297
de Morcerf approached her	82.20361328125
Madame said he	162.01206970214844
I have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and I pray you to do so also	34.36711883544922
The sitting commences at two it is now three and I am to speak	151.752685546875
Go then and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling	127.60753631591797
Monsieur continued she turning to Monte Cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us	99.10022735595703
Believe me madame I feel most grateful for your kindness but I got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and I am ignorant how I am installed in Paris which I scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude I know but one that may be appreciated	94.8557357788086
We shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that	81.99581146240234
Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent	819.5078735351562
I will not detain you monsieur continued the countess I would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate	101.14973449707031
My dear Count said Albert I will endeavor to return your politeness at Rome and place my coup at your disposal until your own be ready	606.8795776367188
A thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the Count of Monte Cristo but I suppose that M	67.66448974609375
Bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half I have given him and that I shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door	72.06014251708984
Albert was used to the counts manner of proceeding he knew that like Nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the counts orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house	112.36233520507812
Monte Cristo was not deceived	69.06926727294922
As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerfs antechamber a footman the same who at Rome had brought the counts card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him	49.03239822387695
It was a coup of Kollers building and with horses and harness for which Drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas	70.78900146484375
Monsieur said the count to Albert I do not ask you to accompany me to my house as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and I have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise	89.95838928222656
Give me therefore one more day before I invite you I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality	80.13252258300781
If you ask me for a day count I know what to anticipate it will not be a house I shall see but a palace	264.01904296875
You have decidedly some genius at your control	81.64058685302734
Ma foi spread that idea replied the Count of Monte Cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies	139.59048461914062
As he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left Madame de Morcerf	134.36895751953125
When Albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	77.95442962646484
Albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered	47.61043167114258
He could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flowerstands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantlepiece the countesss smellingbottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered	56.07954025268555
My dear mother have you been ill during my absence	67.39175415039062
No no Albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orangeflowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes	129.4990692138672
Then my dear mother said Albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber	203.63380432128906
You are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room	415.8610534667969
Was I pale Albert	100.887451171875
Yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself	84.78032684326172
Did your father speak of it inquired Mercds eagerly	57.91667175292969
No madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you	3414.94189453125
20269 m	181.42318725585938
Yes I do remember replied the countess	120.44503784179688
A servant entered summoned by Alberts ring of the bell	404.2618408203125
Take these flowers into the anteroom or dressingroom said the viscount they make the countess ill	126.50900268554688
The footman obeyed his orders	223.8407745361328
A long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed	124.60819244384766
What is this name of Monte Cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title	40.988224029541016
I believe mother it is merely a title	83.89966583251953
The count purchased an island in the Tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	210.244140625
You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of Florence Saint George Constantinian of Parma and even for the Order of Malta	131.5243377685547
Except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at Rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction	68.25983428955078
His manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as I could judge in the few minutes he remained here	115.32102966308594
They are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all I have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of Europethe English the Spanish and the German	173.79856872558594
The countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	92.17617797851562
You have seen my dear AlbertI ask the question as a motheryou have seen M	131.40797424316406
de Monte Cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be	58.42989730834961
What does he appear to be	113.1807632446289
Why you have just saida man of high distinction	113.88106536865234
I told you my dear mother he was esteemed such	191.89630126953125
But what is your own opinion Albert	100.99440002441406
I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but I think him a Maltese	37.94695281982422
I do not ask you of his origin but what he is	138.48141479492188
Ah what he is that is quite another thing	95.48921203613281
I have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what I think I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byrons heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some Manfred some Lara some Werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society	98.10558319091797
You say	87.08187866210938
I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the Mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag	113.50180053710938
Who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection	188.2818145751953
That is possible said the countess reflecting	113.6565933227539
Never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the Count of Monte Cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of Paris	186.12918090820312
Why this very morning in my rooms he made his entre amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting ChteauRenaud	34.780330657958984
And what do you suppose is the counts age inquired Mercds evidently attaching great importance to this question	1.579296588897705
Thirtyfive or thirtysix mother	265.5547180175781
So youngit is impossible said Mercds replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection	200.1618194580078
It is the truth however	114.03468322753906
Three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period I was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and I induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate	81.47962188720703
The age of this singular man who is of no age is then I am certain thirtyfive	489.9353942871094
Besides mother remark how vivid his eye how ravenblack his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkleshe is not only vigorous but also young	84.58512878417969
The countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts	119.07649230957031
And has this man displayed a friendship for you Albert she asked with a nervous shudder	67.63639068603516
I am inclined to think so	204.9865264892578
Why he pleases me in spite of Franz dpinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world	599.7274169921875
The countess shuddered	168.51129150390625
Albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances	14.427557945251465
Now you are a man and are able to give me advice yet I repeat to you Albert be prudent	79.42382049560547
Why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust	386.66754150390625
The count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	88.18096160888672
What then have I to fear from him	345.7930603027344
You are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life	147.01046752929688
How did your father receive him Albert It is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count	104.07860565185547
de Morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it	71.11833190917969
Nothing could be in better taste than my fathers demeanor madame said Albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years	1.1664528846740723
Each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added Albert with a laugh	184.73013305664062
And thus they parted the best possible friends and M	142.9695587158203
de Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers	67.76031494140625
The countess made no reply	453.2027893066406
She fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed	233.86676025390625
The young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome	57.32110595703125
Then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	113.51300048828125
This devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head I said at the time he would create a sensation here and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer	224.98843383789062
My mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable	42.219966888427734
He went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs	58.49677658081055
Most decidedly said he men are not equal and I must beg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers	50.42259979248047
Chapter 42	62.37828826904297
Monsieur Bertuccio	49.25776672363281
Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20000 francs apiece for his horses	69.07456970214844
The house Ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to Monte Cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the Champslyses	273.89813232421875
A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriagedrive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	78.34522247314453
This house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the Rue de Ponthieu	87.44573211669922
Even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hingesthey had seen the Count coming and at Paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning	157.298828125
The coachman entered and traversed the halfcircle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel	328.05615234375
The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriagewindow the one was Ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from Monte Cristo	675.4305419921875
The other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending	110.02991485595703
Thanks M	1.2632997035980225
Bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three steps of the portico and the notary	57.51360321044922
He is in the small salon excellency returned Bertuccio	5.889016151428223
And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house	133.69094848632812
Your excellency it is done already	151.86900329589844
I have been myself to the best engraver of the Palais Royal who did the plate in my presence	81.39539337158203
The first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the Baron Danglars Rue de la Chausse dAntin No	260.799072265625
7 the others are on the mantlepiece of your excellencys bedroom	47.50023651123047
Good what oclock is it	1071.572998046875
Four oclock	95.3018569946289
Monte Cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by Bertuccio who showed him the way	62.22309875488281
These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said Monte Cristo	76.4513168334961
I trust all this will soon be taken away	59.42071533203125
Bertuccio bowed	77.58285522460938
As the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	91.1920394897461
He was a simplelooking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener	98.54987335205078
You are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase monsieur asked Monte Cristo	74.86526489257812
Yes count returned the notary	106.1798095703125
Is the deed of sale ready	46.41189956665039
Yes count	75.70246887207031
Have you brought it	61.41606903076172
Here it is	68.40357971191406
Very well and where is this house that I purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to Bertuccio half to the notary	113.9408187866211
The steward made a gesture that signified I do not know	129.725830078125
The notary looked at the count with astonishment	661.2295532226562
What said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated	307.8711853027344
No returned the count	49.59234619140625
The count does not know	92.30355072021484
How should I know I have arrived from Cadiz this morning	344.72442626953125
I have never before been at Paris and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in France	222.4529266357422
Ah that is different the house you purchase is at Auteuil	27.01636505126953
At these words Bertuccio turned pale	58.94865417480469
And where is Auteuil asked the count	75.60315704345703
Close by here monsieur replied the notarya little beyond Passy a charming situation in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne	43.39247512817383
So near as that said the Count but that is not in the country	208.54010009765625
What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris M	38.27267074584961
I cried the steward with a strange expression	27.801345825195312
His excellency did not charge me to purchase this house	36.11485290527344
If his excellency will recollectif he will think	236.24368286132812
Ah true observed Monte Cristo I recollect now	89.2276840209961
I read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house	82.68657684326172
It is not yet too late cried Bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission I will find you a better at Enghien at FontenayauxRoses or at Bellevue	5.889016151428223
Oh no returned Monte Cristo negligently since I have this I will keep it	71.3052978515625
And you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee	164.14332580566406
It is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after	19.015180587768555
I suppose the count has the tastes of the day	97.86831665039062
To be sure returned Monte Cristo it is very convenient then	23.05506706237793
It is moreit is magnificent	91.09008026123047
Peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned Monte Cristo	36.32371520996094
The deed if you please Mr	342.4510498046875
And he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors	54.18922805786133
Bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsieur	176.01210021972656
The steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there	142.76470947265625
And now demanded the count are all the forms complied with	74.8938980102539
All sir	39.878562927246094
Have you the keys	38.749656677246094
They are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new possessions	45.812774658203125
Very well and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said I have no further need of you you may go	58.19138717651367
But observed the honest notary the count is I think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included	50.96872329711914
And your fee	23.19009780883789
Is included in this sum	16.17236328125
But have you not come from Auteuil here	277.32305908203125
Yes certainly	74.10050201416016
Well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	56.596588134765625
The notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client	104.6077880859375
See this gentleman out said the count to Bertuccio	62.26940155029297
And the steward followed the notary out of the room	58.6009407043457
Scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	205.46681213378906
After having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs	30.42641258239746
Auteuil Rue de la Fontaine No	61.587947845458984
28 it is indeed the same said he and now am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror However in an hour I shall know all	56.24064636230469
Bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong	94.95126342773438
The steward appeared at the door	67.84107971191406
Monsieur Bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in France	118.27305603027344
In some parts of Franceyes excellency	144.8596954345703
You know the environs of Paris then	125.18402862548828
No excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude	72.55300903320312
It is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for I wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information	265.0942077636719
To Auteuil cried Bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividI go to Auteuil	66.65319061279297
Well what is there surprising in that When I live at Auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service	134.4720916748047
Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer	4.351946830749512
Why what has happened to youare you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked Monte Cristo in the same tone that Louis XIV	114.81536102294922
pronounced the famous I have been almost obliged to wait	40.8636474609375
Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice	102.58171081542969
His excellencys horses	146.2823944091797
Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared	32.44517517089844
Your excellencys carriage is at the door said he	245.8378143310547
Well take your hat and gloves returned Monte Cristo	182.870361328125
Am I to accompany you your excellency cried Bertuccio	137.4650115966797
Certainly you must give the orders for I intend residing at the house	60.742820739746094
20277 m	31.814884185791016
It was unexampled for a servant of the counts to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat	71.15025329589844
Chapter 43	68.00765228271484
The House at Auteuil	26.994905471801758
Monte Cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer	1.0424320697784424
Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey	60.5123291015625
In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village	83.82588958740234
Bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed	24.16915512084961
Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine No	44.445068359375
28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order	505.6994934082031
Bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanRue de la Fontaine No	57.6131591796875
28 was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage	73.21000671386719
The carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door	29.384103775024414
Well said the count you do not get out M	14.057014465332031
Bertuccioyou are going to stay in the carriage then What are you thinking of this evening	50.88917922973633
Bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage	48.663631439208984
Knock said the count and announce me	75.44477844238281
Bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared	5.441009044647217
What is it asked he	146.17584228515625
It is your new master my good fellow said the footman	75.72067260742188
And he held out to the concierge the notarys order	39.80793380737305
The house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here	449.7990417480469
Yes my friend returned the count and I will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master	112.87432098388672
Oh monsieur said the concierge I shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all	110.59220886230469
What was the name of your old master said Monte Cristo	152.07249450683594
The Marquis of SaintMran	16.59883689880371
Ah I am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it	192.93603515625
The Marquis of SaintMran returned the count	149.28895568847656
The name is not unknown to me the Marquis of SaintMran and he appeared to meditate	56.009098052978516
An old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the Bourbons he had an only daughter who married M	70.24799346923828
de Villefort who had been the kings attorney at Nmes and afterwards at Versailles	1.0915937423706055
Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling	72.07117462158203
And is not this daughter dead demanded Monte Cristo I fancy I have heard so	74.66608428955078
Yes monsieur oneandtwenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times	456.7362060546875
Thanks thanks said Monte Cristo judging from the stewards utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it	63.78113555908203
Give me a light	39.4382438659668
Shall I accompany you monsieur	103.22232818603516
No it is unnecessary Bertuccio will show me a light	135.8559112548828
And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	29.90345573425293
Ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantlepiece and the shelves I have not got any candles	17.053606033325195
Take one of the carriagelamps Bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments	55.74561309814453
The steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey	64.9663314819336
They went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden	320.6238098144531
Ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	440.8720397949219
Light me M	25.83525848388672
Bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to	100.94004821777344
Monsieur replied Bertuccio it leads to the garden	1.0404788255691528
And pray how do you know that	25.498321533203125
It ought to do so at least	49.80198287963867
Well let us be sure of that	127.32048034667969
Bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	116.67855834960938
At the outer door the steward paused	59.112674713134766
Go on Monsieur Bertuccio said the count	21.76557159423828
But he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections	57.769134521484375
Well insisted the Count	105.3150405883789
No no cried Bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall	80.09642028808594
No monsieur it is impossible I can go no farther	31.928457260131836
What does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo	205.60284423828125
Why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at Auteuil and that purchasing it at Auteuil this house should be No	20.07443618774414
28 Rue de la Fontaine	152.4384765625
Oh why did I not tell you all I am sure you would not have forced me to come	86.70896911621094
I hoped your house would have been some other one than this as if there was not another house at Auteuil than that of the assassination	199.5682830810547
What what cried Monte Cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter Devil of a man Corsican that you arealways mysteries or superstitions	88.58998107910156
Come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me I hope	624.14501953125
Bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed	86.17704010009766
The door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity	65.61473083496094
The steward wished to turn to the left	184.5177001953125
No no monsieur said Monte Cristo	57.68083190917969
What is the use of following the alleys Here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards	29.840972900390625
Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand	169.0272979736328
Monte Cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	39.78498458862305
The steward could not restrain himself	122.6587142944336
Move monsieurmove away I entreat you you are exactly in the spot	43.170711517333984
What spot	69.7905502319336
Where he fell	27.205135345458984
20281 m	222.44412231445312
My dear Monsieur Bertuccio said Monte Cristo laughing control yourself we are not at Sartne or at Corte	94.38119506835938
This is not a Corsican maquis but an English garden badly kept I own but still you must not calumniate it for that	621.8193359375
Monsieur I implore you do not stay there	33.19611358642578
I think you are going mad Bertuccio said the count coldly	100.82156372070312
If that is the case I warn you I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum	98.17849731445312
Alas excellency returned Bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience	221.71102905273438
Alas excellency the evil has arrived	83.4141616821289
Bertuccio said the count I am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and I have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret	24.434907913208008
I knew you were a Corsican	34.469276428222656
I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and I overlooked that in Italy because in Italy those things are thought nothing of	308.219482421875
But in France they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge	61.332191467285156
Bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance	75.7936782836914
Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that at Rome he had bent upon the execution of Andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward	228.12722778320312
The Abb Busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in France in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities	2001.17822265625
Well I shall write to the abb I shall hold him responsible for his protgs misconduct and I shall soon know all about this assassination	87.32192993164062
Only I warn you that when I reside in a country I conform to all its code and I have no wish to put myself within the compass of the French laws for your sake	38.482017517089844
Oh do not do that excellency I have always served you faithfully cried Bertuccio in despair	77.96379089355469
I have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power I have done good	158.54396057128906
I do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	49.376041412353516
It is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man	98.0942153930664
But your excellency replied Bertuccio hesitatingly did not the Abb Busoni who heard my confession in the prison at Nmes tell you that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience	161.0840606689453
Yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward I concluded you had stolenthat was all	221.58029174804688
Oh your excellency returned Bertuccio in deep contempt	189.3273162841797
Or as you are a Corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it	66.0365219116211
Yes my good master cried Bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing else	99.22657775878906
I understand that but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner	41.5627555847168
But monsieur it is very natural returned Bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished	53.04362487792969
What my house	192.8805694580078
Oh your excellency it was not yours then	132.2235870361328
Whose then The Marquis de SaintMran I think the concierge said	148.81871032714844
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de SaintMran	59.4018440246582
Oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another	211.21209716796875
This is strange returned Monte Cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse	280.9645080566406
Monsieur said the steward it is fatality I am sure	65.40257263183594
First you purchase a house at Auteuilthis house is the one where I have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	106.2985610961914
This is not chance for chance in this case is too much like Providence	42.89037322998047
Well amiable Corsican let us suppose it is Providence	52.273048400878906
I always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds	1.1062172651290894
Come collect yourself and tell me all	138.94110107421875
I have related it but once and that was to the Abb Busoni	249.92898559570312
Such things continued Bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession	293.3395080566406
Then said the count I refer you to your confessor	54.01327896118164
Turn Chartreux or Trappist and relate your secrets but as for me I do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and I do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening	293.0406188964844
I confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in Italy justice is only paid when silentin France she is paid only when she speaks	177.94180297851562
Peste I thought you somewhat Corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but I see you have other strings to your bow	77.46519470214844
You are no longer in my service Monsieur Bertuccio	138.3382568359375
Oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason I can not remain in your service I will tell all for if I quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold	141.68667602539062
That is different replied Monte Cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all	93.00035095214844
No monsieur I swear to you by my hopes of salvation I will tell you all for the Abb Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but I pray you go away from that planetree	60.366241455078125
The moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of M	151.12435913085938
de Villefort	171.7880859375
What cried Monte Cristo it was M	91.40164947509766
de Villefort	93.24159240722656
Your excellency knows him	110.19546508789062
The former royal attorney at Nmes	156.14842224121094
Who married the Marquis of SaintMrans daughter	186.61190795898438
Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench	263.8089904785156
Well monsieur said Bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation	116.4049301147461
Was a villain	634.5491333007812
Bah replied Monte Cristo impossible	133.38694763183594
It is as I tell you	94.20741271972656
Ah really said Monte Cristo	274.6281433105469
Have you proof of this	68.88310241699219
I had it	180.47459411621094
And you have lost it how stupid	100.94755554199219
Yes but by careful search it might be recovered	108.63194274902344
Really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me	250.09457397460938
And the count humming an air from Lucia went to sit down on a bench while Bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	68.30182647705078
Bertuccio remained standing before him	206.4518280029297
20285 m	128.01275634765625
Chapter 44	73.90786743164062
The Vendetta	35.45694351196289
At what point shall I begin my story your excellency asked Bertuccio	47.67338180541992
Where you please returned Monte Cristo since I know nothing at all of it	89.70775604248047
I thought the Abb Busoni had told your excellency	50.216453552246094
Some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and I have forgotten them	133.63937377929688
Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency	50.004425048828125
Go on M	206.34988403320312
Bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening papers	79.08833312988281
The story begins in 1815	131.12693786621094
Ah said Monte Cristo 1815 is not yesterday	133.4003143310547
No monsieur and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then	79.47042083740234
I had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Corsicans	383.9701843261719
This brother was my only friend we became orphansI at five he at eighteen	97.11554718017578
He brought me up as if I had been his son and in 1814 he married	56.80873107910156
When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at Waterloo and retired with the army beyond the Loire	134.33314514160156
But that is the history of the Hundred Days M	78.06513214111328
Bertuccio said the count unless I am mistaken it has been already written	128.92994689941406
Excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient	203.2307586669922
Go on I will keep my word	110.84351348876953
One day we received a letter	116.3260269165039
I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano at the extremity of Cap Corse	87.47766876220703
This letter was from my brother	103.88057708740234
He told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by Chteauroux ClermontFerrand Le Puy and Nmes and if I had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at Nmes with an innkeeper with whom I had dealings	76.20753479003906
In the smuggling line said Monte Cristo	112.96257019042969
Eh your excellency Everyone must live	179.4258575439453
Certainly go on	92.80968475341797
I loved my brother tenderly as I told your excellency and I resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself	115.00186920166016
I possessed a thousand francs	162.34986877441406
I left five hundred with Assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred I set off for Nmes	42.525115966796875
It was easy to do so and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project	113.15896606445312
But after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhne	86.37446594238281
At last however we succeeded and worked up to Arles	86.64081573486328
I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire and took the road to Nmes	168.11729431152344
We are getting to the story now	55.73213577270508
Yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see I only tell you what is absolutely necessary	71.17007446289062
Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of France	122.9864501953125
Three brigands called Trestaillon Truphemy and Graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism	122.21168518066406
You have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency	85.29281616210938
Vaguely I was far from France at that period	514.0625
Go on	38.464176177978516
As I entered Nmes I literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned	360.9173583984375
At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became terrified not for myselffor I a simple Corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglersbut for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the Loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend	40.88302993774414
I hastened to the innkeeper	582.0993041992188
My misgivings had been but too true	1.0962920188903809
My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	87.84576416015625
I did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded	126.75531005859375
I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much and which feared nothing and I went to the kings attorney	132.41273498535156
And this kings attorney was named Villefort asked Monte Cristo carelessly	173.31484985351562
Yes your excellency he came from Marseilles where he had been deputy procureur	180.32354736328125
His zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of Elba	100.80128479003906
Then said Monte Cristo you went to him	56.44636154174805
Monsieur I said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nmes I know not by whom but it is your duty to find out	289.978271484375
You are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect	148.05325317382812
Who was your brother asked he	208.78823852539062
A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion	101.64997863769531
A soldier of the usurper then	222.8811492919922
A soldier of the French army	80.45413208007812
Well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword	124.70490264892578
You are mistaken monsieur I replied he has perished by the poniard	808.0219116210938
What do you want me to do asked the magistrate	116.67706298828125
I have already told youavenge him	125.15985870361328
On whom	116.81734466552734
On his murderers	147.2993621826172
How should I know who they are	56.68825912475586
Order them to be sought for	63.30986785888672
Why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel	137.88687133789062
All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct	137.3062744140625
Monsieur I replied it is not for myself that I entreat your interferenceI should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brothers pay alone kept her	37.0618782043457
Pray try and obtain a small government pension for her	96.35588073730469
Every revolution has its catastrophes returned M	118.53570556640625
de Villefort your brother has been the victim of this	109.270263671875
It is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family	87.21236419677734
If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	59.774749755859375
What has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals	89.31491088867188
What cried I do you a magistrate speak thus to me	91.05868530273438
All these Corsicans are mad on my honor replied M	49.1358528137207
de Villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	154.8187255859375
You have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now	242.5692596435547
Go now at once or I shall have you put out	115.8268814086914
I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	1175.4468994140625
But he was a man of stone	123.1441879272461
I approached him and said in a low voice Well since you know the Corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word	190.92735290527344
You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist because you are a royalist	244.9396514892578
Well I who am a Bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that I will kill you	88.57579040527344
From this moment I declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come	46.99507522583008
And before he had recovered from his surprise I opened the door and left the room	103.11739349365234
Well well said Monte Cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things M	122.84297943115234
Bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that But did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta	181.58200073242188
He knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low	112.05950164794922
Fortunately I was so well concealed that he could not find me	276.9122314453125
Then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at Nmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to Versailles	152.34088134765625
But as you know a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on foot	70.28277587890625
The most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least without being arrested	166.2410888671875
I no longer belonged to myself for I had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide for	61.375343322753906
For three months I watched M	166.6859893798828
de Villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following him	153.42645263671875
At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil	272.1481628417969
I followed him thither and I saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there	132.2392120361328
Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded	229.1031036376953
As I had nothing more to do at Versailles I went to Auteuil and gained all the information I could	111.20339965820312
If I wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him	144.96783447265625
The house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to M	54.56885528564453
de SaintMran Villeforts fatherinlaw	42.934913635253906
de SaintMran lived at Marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the Baroness	64.19833374023438
One evening as I was looking over the wall I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and I guessed that she was awaiting M	487.12554931640625
de Villefort	387.799072265625
When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair	156.7973175048828
As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure I saw she would ere long become a mother	69.64451599121094
A few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered	241.11221313476562
The young woman hastened to meet him	122.00364685058594
They threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house	178.83290100097656
The man was M	47.43827438354492
de Villefort I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone	49.71117401123047
20291 m	75.64899444580078
And asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman	207.49472045898438
No excellency returned Bertuccio you will see that I had no time to learn it	111.02691650390625
Go on	340.3479309082031
That evening continued Bertuccio I could have killed the procureur but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood I was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard I might be taken so I put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden	98.27840423583984
Three days after about seven oclock in the evening I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to Svres	72.15892791748047
I concluded that he was going to Versailles and I was not deceived	525.6630249023438
Three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him	41.11813735961914
I descended rapidly although I had not seen Villeforts face I recognized him by the beating of my heart	172.32958984375
I crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden	33.485572814941406
This time I did not content myself with looking but I took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall	100.66525268554688
My first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	80.39242553710938
Nothing then preventing my escape by this means I examined the grounds	665.23583984375
The garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers	1250.329833984375
In order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door M	84.5515365600586
de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	91.91011810302734
20293 m	408.8764343261719
It was the end of September the wind blew violently	146.86248779296875
The faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery	64.23236083984375
I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take and scarcely was I there when amidst the gusts of wind I fancied I heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears	311.44073486328125
Two hours passed thus during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly	47.52450180053711
Midnight struck	77.1856689453125
As the last stroke died away I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended	556.4703369140625
The door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared	173.90550231933594
The terrible moment had come but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least	45.50368881225586
I drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	74.66145324707031
The man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand	56.62153244018555
I was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	13.97276782989502
When he was only a few paces from me I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade	153.57186889648438
I was still unable to divine for what reason M	101.77888488769531
de Villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where I was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth	50.52484130859375
I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely	122.25762176513672
Then I confess curiosity mingled with hatred I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there and I remained motionless holding my breath	123.56534576416016
Then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	112.70184326171875
I let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming	197.05165100097656
I am Giovanni Bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped	1032.4625244140625
I know not if he heard these words I think he did not for he fell without a cry	7.688027858734131
I felt his blood gush over my face but I was intoxicated I was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me	88.64183044433594
In a second I had disinterred the box then that it might not be known I had done so I filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which I doublelocked carrying off the key	46.06774139404297
Ah said Monte Cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery	37.577239990234375
No your excellency returned Bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution	80.63683319091797
And was the sum a large one	29.742633819580078
It was not money	331.31768798828125
Ah I recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant	39.45318603515625
Yes excellency I hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	94.69629669189453
In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	21.035831451416016
Its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet	70.72158813476562
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia I did what a doctor would have doneI inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	301.799560546875
In my turn I uttered a cry but a cry of joy	38.602935791015625
God has not cursed me then I cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life I have taken away	24.889020919799805
20295 m	77.34616088867188
And what did you do with the child asked Monte Cristo	117.6457290649414
It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape	109.29767608642578
I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures	1.679030418395996
As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road and I inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	443.7463073730469
No objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the Rue dEnfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession I rang the bell and fled with all speed	106.6941909790039
A fortnight after I was at Rogliano and I said to Assunta	143.3572998046875
Console thyself sister Israel is dead but he is avenged	60.234920501708984
She demanded what I meant and when I had told her allGiovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it Benedetto and then in consequence of this good action God would have blessed us	177.93482971191406
In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich	53.57803726196289
What letters were marked on the linen said Monte Cristo	14.73582935333252
An H and an N surmounted by a barons coronet	51.00774383544922
By heaven M	72.56494903564453
Bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry	93.41016387939453
In your service excellency where everything is learned	209.51268005371094
Go on I am curious to know two things	195.22483825683594
What are they your excellency	112.02851104736328
What became of this little boy for I think you told me it was a boy M	27.38494110107422
No excellency I do not recollect telling you that	105.99916076660156
I thought you did I must have been mistaken	130.31884765625
No you were not for it was in reality a little boy	25.717266082763672
But your excellency wished to know two things what was the second	55.75098419189453
The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the Abb Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at Nmes	197.47982788085938
The story will be very long excellency	450.2035217285156
What matter you know I take but little sleep and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either	194.94203186035156
Bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	257.26409912109375
Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution	44.2171516418457
The southern districts were illwatched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in Avignon Nmes or Uzs	106.6534423828125
We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	110.04476165771484
Since my brothers assassination in the streets of Nmes I had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire at the sign of the Pont du Gard	226.38734436035156
We had thus at AiguesMortes Martigues or Bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and customhouse officers	852.2841796875
Smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	274.625
And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit	39.76579666137695
So preferring death to capture I accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution	62.88188934326172
In reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled	235.1284942626953
Philosophy M	199.66156005859375
Bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life	58.99907684326172
Oh excellency	79.15130615234375
No no but philosophy at halfpast ten at night is somewhat late yet I have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy	116.2421875
My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive	85.55305480957031
Assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased	296.8986511230469
One day as I was setting off on an expedition Go said she at your return I will give you a surprise	64.81099700927734
I questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and I departed	170.4341583251953
Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to Lucca to take in oil to Leghorn for English cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy	59.11177062988281
When I entered the house the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old	110.3134994506836
I uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this child	19.802324295043945
For the assassination itself I had never felt any remorse	33.70099639892578
Poor Assunta had guessed all	104.99964141845703
She had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for Paris and had reclaimed it	252.43978881835938
No objection was raised and the infant was given up to her	44.9728889465332
Ah I confess your excellency when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle I felt my eyes filled with tears	220.98486328125
Ah Assunta cried I you are an excellent woman and Heaven will bless you	132.7416534423828
This said Monte Cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only faith	230.66197204589844
Alas your excellency is right replied Bertuccio and God made this infant the instrument of our punishment	29.541513442993164
Never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	63.220149993896484
He was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile	28.91387367248535
Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad	71.93902587890625
The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition	72.15367126464844
It is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged him	75.10639953613281
This child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbors orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden	89.17813110351562
One day when Benedetto was about five or six our neighbor Wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuablesfor as your excellency knows there are no thieves in Corsicacomplained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement	74.0246810913086
One day Benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree	346.5085754394531
For more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	42.39930725097656
A boatman who had passed by Rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	74.67042541503906
Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said I confess how you obtained this animal	30.711475372314453
Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity	90.54447937011719
I became angry he began to laugh I threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards	171.9628143310547
You can not beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father	152.64854431152344
20299 m	40.1253776550293
We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	98.2208251953125
The boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of Assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent	80.90443420410156
When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master and everything went ill	646.2218017578125
When he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in Bastia or indeed in Corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution	162.45919799804688
I became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences	78.09000396728516
I was compelled at this period to leave Corsica on an important expedition I reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me	274.18182373046875
I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	1.2197091579437256
I spoke to Benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	138.61697387695312
He heard me patiently and when I had finished burst out laughing	380.8553161621094
Are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum Why I have as much money as I want mother Assunta always furnishes me when I ask for it You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer	80.91561889648438
The arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me	15.128554344177246
Benedetto rejoined his associates and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool	56.4472770690918
Sweet child murmured Monte Cristo	148.39553833007812
Oh had he been my own son replied Bertuccio or even my nephew I would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	23.238632202148438
I gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future	234.5730438232422
My mind was already made up	15.656564712524414
Benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week	170.45675659179688
My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct	46.2164306640625
I set off for France after having fixed upon the plan	104.40133666992188
Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829	170.78208923339844
The most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire	85.54448699951172
20301 m	191.744384765625
Our expedition made a favorable beginning	253.09727478027344
We anchored our vesselwhich had a double hold where our goods were concealedamidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhne from Beaucaire to Arles	54.18975067138672
On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected	170.94839477539062
Whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed I know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our direction	99.97673034667969
It was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhne but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being seen	141.20947265625
In an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the customhouse officers I observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other I sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the Rhne to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to AiguesMortes	67.87857818603516
I was now safe for I could swim along the ditch without being seen and I reached the canal in safety	97.86934661865234
I had designedly taken this direction	30.923818588256836
I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire	298.9180908203125
Yes said Monte Cristo I perfectly recollect him I think he was your colleague	13198.6669921875
Precisely answered Bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another	380.6561584472656
Of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter	64.65583801269531
What was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccios story	95.32858276367188
Gaspard Caderousse he had married a woman from the village of Carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village	31.151296615600586
She was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches	49.481536865234375
As for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage	22.438127517700195
And you say interrupted Monte Cristo that this took place towards the year	1.3087670803070068
1829 your excellency	70.95489501953125
In what month	4.37367582321167
The beginning or the end	115.4305648803711
The evening of the 3rd	132.289794921875
20303 m	98.87051391601562
Ah said Monte Cristo the evening of the 3rd of June 1829	194.9356231689453
Go on	39.31135177612305
It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road I resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	126.109619140625
My intention was if Caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhne and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew	127.81331634521484
I stepped into the shed and it was fortunate I did so for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger	50.78196334838867
I waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because I could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	323.9991149902344
The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of France he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the Beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of Europe often have dealings to the amount of 100000 to 150000 francs	146.8295135498047
Caderousse entered hastily	410.29376220703125
Then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife Hello Carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real	221.3634796142578
An exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step	39.97700500488281
What do you say asked his wife pale as death	41.601173400878906
I say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of Paris will give us 50000 francs for it	82.9141845703125
Only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as I have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession	237.62437438964844
In the meantime please to sit down monsieur and I will fetch you some refreshment	78.63516998291016
The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince	166.67518615722656
Relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals tallied	92.6478042602539
Oh returned she it was a gift of heaven	69.96501922607422
My husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named Edmond Dants	28.10841941833496
This poor fellow whom Caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him	28.7952823638916
But how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned	67.52119445800781
No monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman and as in prison he fell sick and Dants took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the Englishman when he was set free gave this stone to Dants who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abb who was here this morning to deliver it	140.75294494628906
The same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	201.5550994873047
There s only the price we are not agreed about	966.7076416015625
How not agreed about said Caderousse	137.97276306152344
I thought we agreed for the price I asked	41.26425552368164
That is replied the jeweller I offered 40000 francs	88.7615737915039
Forty thousand cried La Carconte we will not part with it for that sum	86.93588256835938
The abb told us it was worth 50000 without the setting	154.86029052734375
What was the abbs name asked the indefatigable questioner	32.38203811645508
The Abb Busoni said La Carconte	53.74964904785156
He was a foreigner	180.296630859375
An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua I believe	61.99745178222656
Let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone	23.432769775390625
Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller	214.52174377441406
At the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut La Carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity	300.3981018066406
And what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said Monte Cristo did you credit it	166.30712890625
Yes your excellency	96.91986083984375
I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man and I thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft	31.10332489013672
That did more honor to your heart than to your experience M	182.2353515625
Had you known this Edmond Dants of whom they spoke	97.40573120117188
No your excellency I had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the Abb Busoni himself when I saw him in the prison at Nmes	28.887798309326172
Go on	245.68630981445312
The jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully	114.27098083496094
I will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone I brought just that sum with me	31.636381149291992
Oh that s no matter replied Caderousse I will go back with you to fetch the other 5000 francs	67.580810546875
No returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse no it is worth no more and I am sorry I offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which I had not seen	107.39239501953125
However I will not go back on my word and I will give 45000	171.90797424316406
At least replace the diamond in the ring said La Carconte sharply	64.563720703125
Ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	24.72112274169922
No matter observed Caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it	130.7731475830078
Yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as I am or content himself with the same story	95.5272445678711
It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	77.53903198242188
He will inform against you	123.77734375
You will have to find the Abb Busoni and abbs who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare	88.02040100097656
The law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50000 or perhaps 55000 francs from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing	85.80001831054688
Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other	124.00306701660156
No said Caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 francs	83.92748260498047
As you please my dear sir said the jeweller I had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin	43.62981033325195
And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of banknotes	56.120765686035156
There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	123.57235717773438
He turned towards his wife	83.70834350585938
What do you think of this he asked in a low voice	134.5622100830078
Let him have itlet him have it she said	51.031890869140625
If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the Abb Busoniin all probability we shall never see him	60.2574462890625
Well then so I will said Caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 francs	81.3592300415039
But my wife wants a gold chain and I want a pair of silver buckles	22.985797882080078
The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded	127.30681610107422
Here he said I am very straightforward in my dealingstake your choice	112.51026153564453
The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs	35.73542404174805
I hope you will not complain now said the jeweller	106.77668762207031
The abb told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered Caderousse	47.54255294799805
Come comegive it to me What a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand	95.78330993652344
I give you 45000 francsthat is 2500 livres of incomea fortune such as I wish I had myself and you are not satisfied	32.03384017944336
And the fiveandforty thousand francs inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they Comelet us see them	83.3116455078125
Here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15000 francs in gold and 30000 francs in banknotes	93.19061279296875
Wait whilst I light the lamp said La Carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake	157.96133422851562
In fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last halfhour	104.92982482910156
The thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller Caderousse or La Carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	105.26397705078125
I myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that I was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream I felt myself riveted to the spot	42.37996292114258
Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn	97.58513641357422
During this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the windows	68.94169616699219
Well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right	260.12701416015625
Yes said Caderousse	339.28253173828125
Give me the pocketbook La Carconte and find a bag somewhere	112.28804779052734
La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a bag	343.6641845703125
From the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple	183.3230438232422
There said Caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10000 francs will you have your supper with us I invite you with goodwill	89.01274108886719
Thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and I must return to Beaucairemy wife will be getting uneasy	128.30039978027344
He drew out his watch and exclaimed Morbleu nearly nine oclockwhy I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight Goodnight my friends	513.098388671875
If the Abb Busoni should by any accident return think of me	114.01924133300781
In another week you will have left Beaucaire remarked Caderousse for the fair ends in a few days	109.61903381347656
True but that makes no difference	91.02569580078125
Write to me at Paris to M	68.67157745361328
Joannes in the Palais Royal arcade Pierre No	112.09835052490234
I will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while	225.9382781982422
At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp	89.34825897216797
20307 m	18.982458114624023
See here exclaimed Caderousse	6566.873046875
You can not think of going out in such weather as this	120.9644775390625
Oh I am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller	91.0962905883789
And then there are robbers said La Carconte	22.704986572265625
The road is never very safe during fair time	84.47927856445312
Oh as to the robbers said Joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle	43.951175689697266
Here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond Friend Caderousse	40.511417388916016
Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look	202.46739196777344
It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought	42.08134460449219
Well then a good journey to you said Caderousse	60.32920837402344
Thanks replied the jeweller	120.16004943847656
He then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out	180.49972534179688
At the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished	39.16830825805664
Oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm	21.742345809936523
Remain said Caderousse	51.6038932800293
You can sleep here	45.961830139160156
Yes do stay added La Carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you	1.0454856157302856
No I must sleep at Beaucaire	82.6673355102539
So once more goodnight	37.44319152832031
Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	28.403980255126953
I can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	209.99806213378906
Do I turn to the right or to the left hand	37.82662582397461
To the right said Caderousse	34.57862091064453
You can not go wrongthe road is bordered by trees on both sides	23.774938583374023
Goodall right said a voice almost lost in the distance	3155.156005859375
Close the door said La Carconte I do not like open doors when it thunders	53.54635238647461
Particularly when there is money in the house eh answered Caderousse doublelocking the door	69.96958923339844
20311 m	256.4076843261719
He came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and banknotes	104.74774932861328
I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	58.002540588378906
The woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals	111.21507263183594
Why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight	102.599365234375
Why said Caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire	314.1308898925781
Ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe I thought it was for something else	181.49232482910156
Woman womanwhy do you have such ideas cried Caderousse or if you have them why do nt you keep them to yourself	44.82617950439453
Well said La Carconte after a moments pause you are not a man	196.5140838623047
What do you mean added Caderousse	96.21021270751953
If you had been a man you would not have let him go from here	355.2090148925781
Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire	24.972984313964844
The road takes a turnhe is obliged to follow itwhile alongside of the canal there is a shorter road	283.0135803222656
Womanyou offend the good God	47.38837814331055
And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode	883.8837890625
Mercy said Caderousse crossing himself	228.943359375
20312 m	69.75302124023438
At the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door	83.64378356933594
Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	170.28688049316406
Who s there cried Caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands	357.50128173828125
It is I shouted a voice	108.74834442138672
And who are you	46.45991897583008
Eh pardieu Joannes the jeweller	222.32579040527344
Well and you said I offended the good God said La Carconte with a horrid smile	549.6859741210938
Why the good God sends him back again	116.3600845336914
Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair	104.643310546875
La Carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so	48.50502395629883
Come in dear M	43.91883087158203
Ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain I am not destined to return to Beaucaire tonight	60.500064849853516
The shortest follies are best my dear Caderousse	97.88414764404297
You offered me hospitality and I accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof	52.9787483215332
Caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow	33.555946350097656
La Carconte doublelocked the door behind the jeweller	429.4774169921875
Chapter 45	145.318115234375
The Rain of Blood	135.03155517578125
As the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened	43.847869873046875
Caderousses hands still grasped the gold and banknotes and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest	188.79002380371094
Well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly I was gone	28.386823654174805
Oh no answered Caderousse that was not my reason I can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream	49.323707580566406
The jeweller smiled	75.5143814086914
Have you any other guests in your house inquired he	162.41319274902344
Nobody but ourselves replied Caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersindeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here	89.55013275146484
Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you	120.85142517089844
Inconvenience us Not at all my dear sir said La Carconte in her most gracious manner	178.51162719726562
Not at all I assure you	57.933021545410156
But where will you manage to stow me	339.7552795410156
In the chamber overhead	178.1202392578125
Surely that is where you yourselves sleep	348.8885498046875
Never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room	76.5501708984375
Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment	79.29440307617188
The jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four freshlaid eggs	80.85896301269531
Caderousse had once more parted with his treasurethe banknotes were replaced in the pocketbook the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard	117.2611312866211
He then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried	59.69744110107422
There said La Carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are	111.3465576171875
And you asked Joannes	22.17519760131836
I do nt want any supper said Caderousse	54.546142578125
We dined so very late hastily interposed La Carconte	107.0942153930664
Then it seems I am to eat alone remarked the jeweller	65.46700286865234
Oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered La Carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took	62.76769256591797
From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash	76.19046020507812
The storm still continued	1529.822021484375
There there said La Carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come back	118.10680389404297
Nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated I shall make another start	53.181941986083984
Its the mistral said Caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning	36.77608871459961
He sighed heavily	360.49835205078125
Well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all I can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad	65.13907623291016
Yes chimed in La Carconte they will have a wretched night of it	110.62924194335938
The jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess	93.5558853149414
Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	87.4285888671875
Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it	10.442184448242188
I believe the storm is over said he	87.6650390625
But as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	75.59184265136719
Trembling and awestruck Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth	211.84371948242188
You must be tired said she to the jeweller I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well	1403.816162109375
Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host goodnight and mounted the stairs	61.03085708618164
He passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps	47.51167678833008
The quick eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended while Caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	29.979251861572266
All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as I was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated I determined to obtain a few hours sleep	66.0438232421875
Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight	93.93651580810547
Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong I sought not to shake it off	35.22639846801758
I looked into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that I could not see the expression of his countenanceneither should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands	127.56915283203125
La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him	196.22100830078125
At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	257.478271484375
La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead	105.53340911865234
20317 m	62.86171340942383
Caderousse shuddered	174.38314819335938
The womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep I did not catch a word she uttered	1.143878698348999
Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually I fell into a deep heavy slumber	42.26456069946289
How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry	257.1676940917969
Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	401.3959655761719
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again I heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	120.30228424072266
A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy	86.14298248291016
Hastily raising myself on one arm I looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when I passed my hand across my brow I felt that it was wet and clammy	121.779296875
To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above	58.94797897338867
The staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle	119.67691802978516
The man was Caderoussehe was pale and his shirt was all bloody	221.99400329589844
Having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps	60.614009857177734
A moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamondseemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head	188.8662872314453
After this he took from his cupboard the banknotes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night	67.57691192626953
Then all became clear and manifest to me and I reproached myself with what had happened as though I myself had done the guilty deed	73.01049041748047
I fancied that I still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead I determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime I had committed but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent	39.81325149536133
For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room	211.19850158691406
The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and I found myself in the house	252.3639678955078
Hastily snatching up the lighted candle I hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs	129.99220275878906
It was that of La Carconte	10.484679222106934
The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her	3522.000244140625
The shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	152.17709350585938
She was stone dead	36.460243225097656
I strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder	92.39091491699219
The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	156.4955596923828
The murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	47.097755432128906
I stumbled over some object I stooped to examineit was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet	7.993239402770996
I approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	51.6094856262207
This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that I could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly	304.074951171875
I rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	119.4122543334961
Upon reaching the room below I found five or six customhouse officers and two or three gendarmesall heavily armed	76.29403686523438
They threw themselves upon me	77.46086883544922
I made no resistance I was no longer master of my senses	68.62989807128906
When I strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	245.36856079101562
As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my bloodstained garments I involuntarily surveyed myself and then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte	71.61903381347656
I pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself	86.0968246459961
What does he mean asked a gendarme	174.2207489013672
One of the officers went to the place I directed	119.57533264160156
He means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through	118.38184356689453
Then I saw that they took me for the assassin	153.2540283203125
I recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while I managed to stammer forth	72.07946014404297
I did not do it Indeed indeed I did not	94.54582214355469
A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast	91.69316864013672
Stir but a step said they and you are a dead man	104.84564208984375
Why should you threaten me with death cried I when I have already declared my innocence	95.38587188720703
Tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at Nmes	81.6815185546875
Meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly	51.75931930541992
Alas resistance was far from my thoughts	477.3027038574219
I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to Nmes	87.34700012207031
I had been tracked by a customsofficer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	216.08665466308594
One only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abb Busoni who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning	127.0511474609375
If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the Abb Busoni then indeed I was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth	416.5252685546875
Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would	80.56761169433594
Caderousse still evaded all pursuit and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate	53.40773391723633
My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the 8th of Septemberthat is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my lifethe Abb Busoni whom I never ventured to believe I should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire	361.51641845703125
You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him and how minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard	94.15935516357422
I felt some degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all I said	1.3438293933868408
And then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind I besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life	88.67585754394531
That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	326.435791015625
My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused	39.174190521240234
When he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence	54.5245361328125
I had speedy proofs that the excellent abb was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held	28.474515914916992
In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to France where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	60.052955627441406
The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and I was immediately set at liberty	1207.4354248046875
And then it was I presume said Monte Cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abb Busoni	162.38352966308594
It was your excellency the benevolent abb took an evident interest in all that concerned me	197.8251495361328
Your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you if you get out do nt take it up again	110.62153625488281
But how inquired I am I to maintain myself and my poor sister	84.89488983154297
A person whose confessor I am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant	54.6793327331543
Would you like such a post If so I will give you a letter of introduction to him	83.1237564086914
Oh father I exclaimed you are very good	120.69224548339844
But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent my recommendation	182.5588836669922
I extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me	53.93558883666992
It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you	67.25435638427734
Here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so	166.33592224121094
No replied the count I take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully Bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me	159.29241943359375
I your excellency	129.73638916015625
Yes you	73.15347290039062
How comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either	112.6003189086914
20323 m	73.63956451416016
Alas I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	8.362045288085938
Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister I lost no time in hastening to Corsica but when I arrived at Rogliano I found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	48.88658142089844
Acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of Benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession	101.19377899169922
One morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kindhearted Assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence	126.6839370727539
Evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return	82.83171844482422
As the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	1.137427806854248
She stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threenone other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed	217.4824676513672
Put her to torture and shell soon tell us where her money is	51.05207061767578
It unfortunately happened that our neighbor Wasilio was at Bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling	168.07000732421875
Two held poor Assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners	30.26929473876953
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted	47.59835433959961
In the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	383.4700927734375
Covered with flames Assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was Assunta calling for help	112.95281982421875
The cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as Wasilios wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when Assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen	124.10528564453125
Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him	61.16825866699219
It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead	98.49993896484375
And in what light did you view the occurrence inquired Monte Cristo	31.100055694580078
As a punishment for the crime I had committed answered Bertuccio	120.27440643310547
Oh those Villeforts are an accursed race	109.39371490478516
Truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone	534.3200073242188
And now resumed Bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which I revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause	1.036380648612976
At this instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave in which lies M	312.2289733886719
de Villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child	138.1787872314453
Everything is possible said Monte Cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead	163.39178466796875
The Abb Busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	182.3997344970703
As for that Benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him	64.97215270996094
No far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself I should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast	106.1874008178711
Thank God I have never heard his name mentioned by any person and I hope and believe he is dead	63.38722610473633
Do not think so Bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for God seems to have them under his special watchcare to make of them instruments of his vengeance	76.36299896240234
So be it responded Bertuccio all I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again	81.64720916748047
And now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingyou are my judge on earth as the Almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation	1.5490870475769043
My good friend I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the Abb Busoni	131.49806213378906
Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others	220.07420349121094
Benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn	210.5893096923828
As far as you yourself are concerned I see but one point in which you are really guilty	290.54144287109375
Ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother There was the crime Bertucciothat was where you became really culpable	108.94037628173828
True excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that I acted like a coward	28.479921340942383
My first duty directly I had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so I must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and I clung to life partly on my sisters account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance	47.91633987426758
Perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own	140.55502319335938
And then again I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother	205.9388885498047
Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	98.50186920166016
After a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner	277.03875732421875
In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips of the Abb Busoni	103.61446380615234
For all evils there are two remediestime and silence	123.82061004638672
And now leave me Monsieur Bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden	148.16065979003906
The very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	87.83186340332031
The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade	63.647186279296875
Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will	5537.8359375
This to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is I assure you a most agreeable surprise	1.079193353652954
I have no fear of ghosts and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	1.096542239189148
Retire within Bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	1236.3553466796875
Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abb Busoni send for me if I am still on earth and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity	31.635303497314453
Bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily	13.452269554138184
Monte Cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured	272.0534362792969
Here beneath this planetree must have been where the infants grave was dug	91.01609802246094
There is the little door opening into the garden	230.8517608642578
At this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment	428.6332702636719
There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth	1.0454856157302856
After making the tour of the garden a second time the count reentered his carriage while Bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masters features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	1.0617059469223022
The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris	45.36204528808594
That same evening upon reaching his abode in the Champslyses the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner	218.0033721923828
Nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit	59.741127014160156
Ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey	191.35098266601562
Having given various orders to Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the Count drawing out his watch said to the attentive Nubian	99.89677429199219
It is halfpast eleven oclock Hayde will soon be here	375.7220764160156
Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming	223.6941680908203
Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence	157.37454223632812
Ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep	193.63731384277344
I understand said Monte Cristo well acquainted with Alis pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleepingchamber	100.93321228027344
Ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative	312.4388122558594
Madame will be tired tonight continued Monte Cristo and will no doubt wish to rest	203.964111328125
Desire the French attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire	60.67082977294922
You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of this country	55.55412673950195
He bowed	167.7052764892578
Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge	323.6444091796875
The gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the steps	49.97687911987305
The count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold	140.76731872558594
She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	44.295814514160156
Some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods converse	609.642822265625
The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity	206.66616821289062
Preceded by Ali who carried a rosecolored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte Cristos companion in Italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself	31.983572006225586
In another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept	136.52798461914062
Chapter 46	614.1258544921875
Unlimited Credit	103.9187240600586
About two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresa person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there and if he were within	329.2044677734375
While waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent	91.5468521118164
His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheekbones were broad and projecting a neverfailing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his buttonhole	79.92035675048828
The groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porters lodge saying	109.88525390625
Pray does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here	97.54251861572266
His excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at Ali	24.515247344970703
Ali returned a sign in the negative	118.29600524902344
But what asked the groom	329.64019775390625
His excellency does not receive visitors today	104.12138366699219
Then here is my masters card the Baron Danglars	84.8436508178711
You will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the Chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him	193.49822998046875
I never speak to his excellency replied the concierge the valet de chambre will carry your message	56.2589111328125
The groom returned to the carriage	71.2505111694336
Well asked Danglars	131.26400756835938
The man somewhat crestfallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said	32.27802658081055
Bless me murmured Baron Danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	305.2936096191406
However it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so I must see him when he requires his money	132.70616149902344
Then throwing himself back in his carriage Danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road To the Chamber of Deputies	121.57088470458984
Apprised in time of the visit paid him Monte Cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	191.5838165283203
That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	158.005615234375
How comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpentlike forehead round vultureshaped head and sharphooked nose like the beak of a buzzard Ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong	337.6412353515625
Ali appeared	45.88083267211914
Summon Bertuccio said the count	305.6900939941406
Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment	72.08399200439453
Did your excellency desire to see me inquired he	139.5841064453125
I did replied the count	87.78491973876953
You no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door	242.48135375976562
Certainly your excellency	117.85582733154297
I noticed them for their remarkable beauty	94.0478515625
Then how comes it said Monte Cristo with a frown that when I desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in Paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables	84.81185913085938
At the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke Ali turned pale and held down his head	79.38228607177734
It is not your fault my good Ali said the count in the Arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or faceit is not your fault	130.8971710205078
You do not understand the points of English horses	30.12326431274414
The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity	41.342437744140625
Permit me to assure your excellency said Bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours	74.28977966308594
Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders	139.17941284179688
It seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price	248.41552734375
His excellency is not perhaps aware that M	121.85591125488281
Danglars gave 16000 francs for his horses	141.5028839111328
Very well	88.5114517211914
Then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital	45.255027770996094
Is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward	53.719024658203125
Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased	140.96170043945312
I have to pay a visit this evening replied he	95.08257293701172
I desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage	43.15378189086914
Bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said At what oclock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready	122.39633178710938
At five oclock replied the count	218.0157470703125
I beg your excellencys pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two oclock	483.753662109375
I am perfectly aware of that fact answered Monte Cristo calmly	90.91962432861328
Then turning towards Ali he said Let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage	123.76908111572266
Request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments	179.7590789794922
Now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither	205.94400024414062
Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	50.043434143066406
Monsieur Baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me	69.00253295898438
You suit me very well	307.5973815917969
Baptistin bowed low	239.52955627441406
It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you	200.6295623779297
Oh your excellency exclaimed Baptistin eagerly	52.62894821166992
Listen if you please till I have finished speaking replied Monte Cristo	494.1916198730469
You receive 1500 francs per annum for your services heremore than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains	194.09518432617188
You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money	1460.045654296875
Then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you	47.815406799316406
Again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages	111.09486389160156
Nay indeed your excellency	440.1033020019531
I am not condemning you for this Monsieur Baptistin but let your profits end here	162.5838165283203
It would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill	100.27078247070312
I neither illuse nor illtreat my servants by word or action	300.3398132324219
An error I readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	600.9240112304688
My commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and I would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood	73.09949493408203
I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity	108.0134048461914
If then I should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service	73.81041717529297
You may now retire	97.1101303100586
I never caution my servants a second timeremember that	191.43194580078125
Baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door	77.08073425292969
I forgot to mention to you said the count that I lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom I am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death	89.7090835571289
You have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulatelet it continue to do so	138.83839416503906
This address delivered in the presence of Ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on M	267.090087890625
Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics	72.83565521240234
I assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and I will take M	114.47140502929688
Ali as my model	410.317626953125
By no means replied the count in the most frigid tones Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities	83.94393157958984
He can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slavea dog who should he fail in his duty towards me I should not discharge from my service but kill	1.5852558612823486
Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	120.381591796875
You seem incredulous said Monte Cristo who repeated to Ali in the Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French	411.78216552734375
The Nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	109.61270904541016
This corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of M	67.02906036376953
The count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to Ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together	277.9191589355469
As the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong	212.2726593017578
When Ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned Baptistin and three Bertuccio	29.904401779174805
The steward entered	129.73065185546875
My horses said Monte Cristo	138.60646057128906
They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired	17.20023536682129
Does your excellency wish me to accompany him	108.4041976928711
No the coachman Ali and Baptistin will go	140.9315948486328
The count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of Danglars	75.751220703125
As he passed them he said	348.4192199707031
They are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner	118.22631072998047
Indeed your excellency I had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price	157.3455810546875
Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders	35.26864242553711
Nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that I could wish	234.3376007080078
Whither does your excellency desire to be driven	23.246036529541016
To the residence of Baron Danglars Rue de la Chausse dAntin	4.793801307678223
This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriagedrive	9.649153709411621
As Bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back	352.05120849609375
I have another commission for you M	258.7554626464844
Bertuccio said he I am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandyfor instance between Le Havre and Boulogne	78.28443145751953
You see I give you a wide range	1030.449951171875
It will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	419.7729187011719
She draws only fifteen feet	2114.454833984375
She must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal	121.78753662109375
Make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name	188.04566955566406
The corvette must now I think be on her way to Fcamp must she not	1.068495273590088
20333 m	227.42007446289062
Certainly your excellency I saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted Marseilles	232.38006591796875
And the yacht	196.5918731689453
Was ordered to remain at Martigues	167.820556640625
Tis well	50.9881477355957
I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert	90.48345184326172
And the steamboat	110.78301239013672
She is at Chlons	366.4653625488281
The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels	136.56919860839844
Very good	129.18959045410156
When you have purchased the estate I desire I want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road	68.63961791992188
Your excellency may depend upon me	206.826171875
The Count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house	200.56748962402344
Danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee	223.3883514404297
But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced	46.76836395263672
As the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other Chamber he said	93.19127655029297
Gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is thisThomson   French the Roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me	61.53423309326172
I confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity	37.80644989013672
I took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended countif he were a real count he would nt be so rich	81.39124298095703
But would you believe it He was not receiving	556.7717895507812
So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	45.2739372253418
I made inquiries and found that the house in the Champslyses is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	63.497859954833984
But pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given	34.101558685302734
I am very anxious to see this man	70.59268188476562
I suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with	86.14503479003906
They laugh best who laugh last	194.70718383789062
Having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chausse dAntin	122.10206604003906
It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury	84.91913604736328
He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	1427.6546630859375
The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room	47.886573791503906
With a slight inclination of the head Danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	84.19403839111328
The count sat down	122.00650024414062
20335 m	30.783376693725586
I have the honor I presume of addressing M	258.85504150390625
de Monte Cristo	177.07464599609375
The count bowed	94.21392822265625
And I of speaking to Baron Danglars chevalier of the Legion of Honor and member of the Chamber of Deputies	164.73619079589844
Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the barons card	167.3947296142578
Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips	89.89144897460938
You will I trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people	250.75802612304688
So much so replied Monte Cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count	308.39849853515625
Upon my word monsieur said Danglars with affected carelessness I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is I was made baron and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor in return for services rendered but	73.38357543945312
But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs	259.8789367675781
de Montmorency and Lafayette That was a noble example to follow monsieur	93.72525024414062
Why replied Danglars not entirely so with the servantsyou understand	54.856895446777344
I see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen	188.51153564453125
These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	37.43134689331055
I understand perfectly	144.89645385742188
Again Danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial	176.5027618408203
Permit me to inform you Count said he bowing that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson   French of Rome	69.32960510253906
I am glad to hear it baronfor I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants	460.8984680175781
I have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth	95.2953109741211
But as regards the letter of advice I am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself	55.65992736816406
You have received a regular letter of advice	40.98958206176758
Yes said Danglars but I confess I did nt quite comprehend its meaning	107.48128509521484
And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation	25.728660583496094
Go on monsieur	44.81132507324219
Here I am ready to give you any explanation you desire	68.72657775878906
Why said Danglars in the letterI believe I have it about mehere he felt in his breastpocketyes here it is	70.71379852294922
Well this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house	42.04877853393555
Well baron what is there difficult to understand about that	111.31205749511719
Merely the term unlimitednothing else certainly	56.11784744262695
Is not that word known in France The people who wrote are AngloGermans you know	40.79734420776367
Oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document I certainly have doubts	64.75799560546875
Is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	172.39715576171875
Is it possible that Thomson   French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers Pray tell me what you think baron for I feel uneasy I can assure you having some considerable property in their hands	23.75696563720703
Thomson   French are perfectly solvent replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague	56.787010192871094
Is in fact unlimited said Monte Cristo	102.1153335571289
Precisely what I was about to say cried Danglars	131.7310791015625
Now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out	74.36807250976562
Meaning to say rejoined Monte Cristo that however Thomson   French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example	61.67064666748047
Not at all	151.5271453857422
Plainly enough Messrs	123.46992492675781
Thomson   French set no bounds to their engagements while those of M	132.88124084472656
Danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing	181.993408203125
Monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned	95.48297882080078
It seems then reserved for me said Monte Cristo coldly to be the first to do so	18.06806755065918
By what right sir	75.20201873779297
By right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive	167.41844177246094
Once more Danglars bit his lips	46.78138732910156
It was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground	150.4852294921875
His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence	41.38117218017578
Monte Cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage	69.40525817871094
Well sir resumed Danglars after a brief silence I will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me	81.32528686523438
Why truly replied Monte Cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need	51.268760681152344
The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	8.914520263671875
So throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air	27.34183692932129
Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million	15.097113609313965
I beg your pardon interposed Monte Cristo	502.6887512207031
I said a million replied Danglars with the confidence of ignorance	9.224788665771484
But could I do with a million retorted the count	53.44383239746094
My dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account	393.185791015625
A million Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressingcase	79.8827896118164
And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer	107.11622619628906
A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction	16.65081787109375
The effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy	116.14007568359375
The pupils of his eyes as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly	43.85820007324219
Come come said Monte Cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson   French	41.35297775268555
I understand and foreseeing that such might be the case I took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions	78.53201293945312
See here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of Arstein   Eskeles of Vienna to Baron Rothschild the other drawn by Baring of London upon M	59.41073989868164
Now sir you have but to say the word and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms	1085.354248046875
The blow had struck home and Danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker	84.65969848632812
Oh sir said Danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before himthree letters of unlimited credit I can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment	40.49985122680664
Nay answered Monte Cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	25.620460510253906
Then you can let me have some money can you not	131.89651489257812
Whatever you say my dear count I am at your orders	57.63098907470703
Why replied Monte Cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such I presume is the case Danglars bowed assentingly	82.11601257324219
You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind	137.02438354492188
Oh my dear count exclaimed Danglars I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you	423.4073181152344
No you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to	77.25025177001953
Six millions gasped Danglarsso be it	79.96853637695312
Then if I should require more continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner why of course I should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned	148.29798889160156
However we shall see	108.02467346191406
Be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs tomorrow	76.10004425048828
I shall be at home till midday or if not I will leave a receipt with my steward	53.92941665649414
The money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied Danglars	46.114864349365234
How would you like to have it in gold silver or notes	174.5247344970703
Half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his seat	32.232147216796875
I must confess to you count said Danglars that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me	273.1348876953125
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it	77.44927215576172
It has been in the family a very long while returned Monte Cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital	48.94303894042969
The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years	195.5432586669922
Your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	94.71427154541016
However you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long	172.8325653076172
And the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz dpinay	23.06389617919922
With your tastes and means of gratifying them continued Danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade	22.28095054626465
If I mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room	30.343032836914062
If you will permit me I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as such	59.848243713378906
Not a modern picture among them	67.93022155761719
I can not endure the modern school of painting	21.742345809936523
You are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become old	42.46094512939453
Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen Bartoloni and Canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive I think but very indifferently of our French sculptors	95.96686553955078
You have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots	82.4405517578125
But all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	135.16607666015625
For the present I will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family	78.84192657470703
Monte Cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	154.47862243652344
Is the baroness at home inquired Danglars	29.325082778930664
Yes my lord answered the man	1.0832489728927612
And alone	57.99609375
No my lord madame has visitors	135.5126190185547
Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito	45.8526611328125
No indeed replied Monte Cristo with a smile I do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing	41.0546875
And who is with madameM	131.9785614013672
Debray inquired Danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made Monte Cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life	29.309404373168945
Yes my lord replied the servant M	185.6674346923828
Debray is with madame	86.61978912353516
Danglars nodded his head then turning to Monte Cristo said M	203.6482696533203
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the Minister of the Interior	127.41637420654297
As for my wife I must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France	95.88101196289062
Her maiden name was De Servires and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne	140.14291381835938
I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars but I have already met M	393.2330627441406
Lucien Debray	28.732643127441406
Ah indeed said Danglars and where was that	36.32087707519531
At the house of M	62.98614501953125
de Morcerf	89.85845184326172
Ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you	94.46952819824219
We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome	100.48065948486328
True true cried Danglars	49.60691452026367
Let me see have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape I forget how but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy	74.56351470947266
Her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	69.77963256835938
With your permission said Danglars bowing I will precede you to show you the way	45.33513641357422
By all means replied Monte Cristo I follow you	130.05929565429688
Chapter 47	934.5449829101562
The Dappled Grays	115.47190856933594
The baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white Indian muslin	84.87230682373047
The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of Boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed	167.25645446777344
The truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M	291.54620361328125
Danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day	1.0173492431640625
The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray	25.720577239990234
Danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the Directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sittingroom where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness	94.5788345336914
Madame Danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while Lucien Debray standing before a small worktable was turning over the pages of an album	41.951053619384766
Lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars	106.43143463134766
It will be remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	216.38308715820312
Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray	112.98245239257812
This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	130.0279083251953
A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M	54.28310775756836
Danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with Danglars a free and easy nod	262.39410400390625
Baroness said Danglars give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at Rome	75.7968521118164
I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money	41.225040435791016
That means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which I trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments	165.41896057128906
In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address Madame Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months and who had selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance	177.71014404296875
And when did you arrive here inquired she	201.60699462890625
Yesterday morning madame	142.93853759765625
Coming as usual I presume from the extreme end of the globe Pardon meat least such I have heard is your custom	81.28326416015625
Nay madame	92.0892333984375
This time I have merely come from Cadiz	220.61036682128906
You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit	83.07066345214844
Paris is a horrible place in summer	81.54243469238281
Balls parties and ftes are over the Italian opera is in London the French opera everywhere except in Paris	68.02091979980469
As for the Thatre Franais you know of course that it is nowhere	81.62576293945312
The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the ChampdeMars and Satory	40.052127838134766
Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count	152.49569702148438
I shall do whatever they do at Paris madame if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement	177.19737243652344
Are you fond of horses count	81.62342071533203
I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East madame and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women	27.524391174316406
Nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first	332.19598388671875
You see madame how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here	164.31349182128906
At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone	238.135498046875
Madame Danglars turned very pale then exclaimed	31.915212631225586
I can not believe it the thing is impossible	210.90948486328125
I assure you madame replied the woman it is as I have said	34.41753387451172
Turning impatiently towards her husband Madame Danglars demanded Is this true	40.45586013793945
Is what true madame inquired Danglars visibly agitated	53.534236907958984
What my maid tells me	67.47020721435547
But what does she tell you	104.05731201171875
That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge	128.92889404296875
I desire to know what is the meaning of this	68.67245483398438
Be kind enough madame to listen to me said Danglars	126.82500457763672
Oh yes I will listen monsieur for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	50.16877746582031
These two gentlemen shall decide between us but first I will state the case to them	53.334529876708984
Gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in Paris	188.31837463378906
But to you at least M	76.77517700195312
Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known	87.63561248779297
Well I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively gone	22.54758644104004
No doubt M	302.7452087402344
Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs	149.52696228027344
Oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators	31.15015983581543
Madame replied Danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account	58.171993255615234
Nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris	63.93313980102539
But perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses	86.51844787597656
My dear love pray do not say any more about them and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady	18.488771438598633
The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards Monte Cristo and saidUpon my word count I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	136.1288604736328
You are setting up an establishment of course	139.014404296875
Why yes replied the count	47.01328659057617
I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses	152.12863159179688
I have almost given them away as it is but as I before said I was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms	44.33798599243164
They were only fit for a young man	42.9722785949707
I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said Monte Cristo but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and I do not think they were dear	285.963623046875
There they are	2058.85791015625
Come M	104.67259979248047
Debray you are a connoisseur I believe let me have your opinion upon them	63.99802017211914
As Debray walked towards the window Danglars approached his wife	1.044033408164978
I could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them	67.70944213867188
Some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is I have gained 16000 francs by the sale of them	31.925905227661133
Come do nt look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what you like with and Eugnie shall have 2000	65.02558135986328
There what do you think now of the affair Was nt I right to part with the horses	146.71768188476562
Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt	39.75205612182617
Great heavens suddenly exclaimed Debray	94.44908142089844
What is it asked the baroness	38.598777770996094
I can not be mistaken there are your horses The very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage	89.26032257080078
My dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window	82.7309799194336
Tis indeed they said she	177.360107421875
Danglars looked absolutely stupefied	65.45751190185547
How very singular cried Monte Cristo with wellfeigned astonishment	52.77207565307617
I can not believe it murmured the banker	58.305015563964844
Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray who approached Monte Cristo saying The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses	29.2760009765625
I scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 francs	261.8031921386719
Debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness	69.6848373413086
Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him	155.95651245117188
See said the count how very ungrateful women are	168.41513061523438
Your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her	127.83422088623047
But so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe	46.13296127319336
Therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves	58.3298225402832
Danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of Olympic Jove predicted a storm	50.87428283691406
Debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while Monte Cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife	165.024658203125
20347 m	131.2750244140625
Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to himself as he came away	90.02447509765625
All has gone according to my wishes	73.8795394897461
The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands	17.838075637817383
Now then to play another masterstroke by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wifedelightful Still added he amid all this I have not yet been presented to Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars whose acquaintance I should have been glad to make	57.92937469482422
But he went on with his peculiar smile I am here in Paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for that	50.71499252319336
With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	2248.401123046875
Two hours afterwards Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	9.744902610778809
The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond	68.3648452758789
To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses	272.7752990722656
During the evening Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil accompanied by Ali	214.4748992919922
The following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count	386.97412109375
Ali observed his master as the Nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not	158.6522674560547
Ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative	2296.606201171875
I thought I did not mistake	443.2028503417969
With your lasso you could stop an ox	62.177127838134766
Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture	115.38395690917969
Or a tiger	132.04420471191406
Ali bowed his head in token of assent	187.74050903320312
A lion even	456.3249816894531
Ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion	169.59573364257812
I understand said Monte Cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion	107.17268371582031
Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions	131.25042724609375
But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury	174.36395263671875
The Nubian smiled	239.36375427246094
It is well said Monte Cristo	54.476741790771484
Then listen to me	149.64187622070312
Ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door	95.64971923828125
Ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him	74.99403381347656
The count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising Ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while Monte Cristo reentered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	38.977909088134766
Still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner	146.90591430664062
He stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on Ali but the regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	60.25336456298828
Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	80.50471496582031
In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others arms	41.77994155883789
Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	85.82821655273438
The carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror	127.5516357421875
Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way	71.81060791015625
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion	53.301239013671875
All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital	134.96133422851562
The brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness	226.01705932617188
Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa	309.01678466796875
Compose yourself madame said he all danger is over	66.64334106445312
The woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	744.7574462890625
I understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass	81.95844268798828
Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears See how deadly pale he is My child my darling Edward speak to your motheropen your dear eyes and look on me once again Oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy	205.1437530517578
With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand Monte Cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childs lips	1.0509536266326904
Scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	99.21417999267578
At this the delight of the mother was almost frantic	163.28701782226562
Where am I exclaimed she and to whom am I indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm	174.84317016601562
Madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings	345.56475830078125
My wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	205.69590759277344
All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars beautiful horses and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them	471.62567138671875
Is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness	104.47030639648438
They do indeed	86.82377624511719
May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars	199.3385009765625
20351 m	119.80818176269531
I have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred	158.1534423828125
I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them I ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands	275.6814270019531
You are then doubtless the Count of Monte Cristo of whom Hermine has talked to me so much	143.4065399169922
You have rightly guessed madame replied the count	141.48622131347656
And I am Madame Hlose de Villefort	180.72312927246094
The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	192.63699340820312
How grateful will M	82.82223510742188
de Villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child Most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished	134.997314453125
Indeed I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in	59.96104431152344
I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man	98.49651336669922
I beseech you madame replied Monte Cristo not to spoil Ali either by too great praise or rewards	164.70108032226562
I can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render	112.9993667602539
Ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me	115.20802307128906
Nay interposed Madame de Villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own	1.047056794166565
His life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death	27.432815551757812
Madame de Villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	168.5741424560547
During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	190.8401641845703
The child was small for his age and unnaturally pale	154.17242431640625
A mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment	31.75575065612793
His mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	63.971351623535156
His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles	109.05564880371094
Touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale	115.60523223876953
Madame de Villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count	313.27154541015625
At this moment Ali entered	99.83967590332031
At sight of him Madame de Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said	2851.25439453125
Edward dearest do you see that good man He has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces	81.28245544433594
Thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks	137.9720458984375
The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying He s too ugly	162.0055694580078
20353 m	102.52845001220703
The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed	94.24968719482422
This lady said the Count speaking to Ali in the Arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly	93.95587158203125
Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the heart	112.08658599853516
Will you permit me to inquire said Madame de Villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here	186.16920471191406
No I do not replied Monte Cristo it is a small place I have purchased quite lately	1180.428466796875
My place of abode is No	120.55673217773438
30 Avenue des Champslyses but I see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	161.40106201171875
Anticipating your wishes I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and Ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash	44.056602478027344
As soon as that important business is concluded I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars	151.15989685058594
I dare not return with those dreadful horses said Madame de Villefort	23.155807495117188
You will see replied Monte Cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of Ali	239.69830322265625
With him they will be gentle and docile as lambs	24.115697860717773
Ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths	40.85099411010742
Then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage Ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg SaintHonor	58.94047927856445
20355 m	135.2285919189453
Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars	71.17668914794922
Dear HermineI have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom I little expected to see today	5.79702615737915
I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits	135.44091796875
Your horses got as far as Ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strangelooking manan Arab a negro or a Nubian at least a black of some nation or otherat a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape	91.18904113769531
The count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life	39.760414123535156
He sent us home in his own carriage	198.24386596679688
Yours will be returned to you tomorrow	141.3048553466797
You will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man	126.31930541992188
The count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday	198.7937469482422
20356 m	160.5548553466797
Adieu I can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristoand certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems I for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the Bois behind your horses	229.59359741210938
Edward endured the accident with miraculous couragehe did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over	204.31085205078125
I doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body	51.6695556640625
Valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear Eugnie	91.65605163574219
I embrace you with all my heart	144.76475524902344
Hlose de Villefort	35.622596740722656
Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte Cristo at your house	66.18038940429688
I must and will see him again	21.402170181274414
I have just made M	33.35300827026367
de Villefort promise to call on him and I hope the visit will be returned	63.43031692504883
That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere	553.7505493164062
Albert related it to his mother ChteauRenaud recounted it at the Jockey Club and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	322.9309997558594
Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure	226.3831329345703
As for M	1.185193657875061
de Villefort he fulfilled the predictions of Hlose to the letterdonned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to No	3.768282175064087

Chapter 48	62.133975982666016
If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which M	35.522682189941406
de Villefort had taken	23.275068283081055
Standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody M	879.380126953125
de Villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a Mol	554.2791137695312
His drawingroom under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the wellregulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained	177.2845916748047
A freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deepseated hatred of idealitythese were the elements of private and public life displayed by M	199.20347595214844
de Villefort	189.11529541015625
30023 m	59.52896499633789
de Villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist	77.07577514648438
His relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted	231.69398498535156
Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of M	73.2732925415039
de Villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	60.021175384521484
This fortress was his post as kings attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition	146.5738983154297
Ordinarily M	187.9107666015625
de Villefort made and returned very few visits	59.84819030761719
His wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom Pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the Greeks Know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others	84.51441192626953
To his friends M	604.0347290039062
de Villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the lawmade man	203.48617553710938
He had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial	70.7484359741211
Four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based	40.23552322387695
de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in France	113.88237762451172
He gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour onlythat is to say fiveandforty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls	111.91190338134766
He was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort	183.79588317871094
Occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of himsometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess	284.384765625
Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristos door	263.5177001953125
The valet de chambre announced M	101.64076232910156
de Villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from St	32.8985481262207
Petersburg to China	41.55841827392578
The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice	1.0454856157302856
He was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at Marseilles	2745.3427734375
Nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	17.187734603881836
From being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deepset eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face	38.2528190612793
He dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his buttonhole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	114.96321868896484
Although master of himself Monte Cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as Monte Cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the Holy See or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights	127.60669708251953
Sir said Villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks	1.0454856157302856
I have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude	53.646419525146484
And as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	142.94296264648438
He spoke in a voice of the procureurgeneral with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law	66.16360473632812
Monsieur replied the count with a chilling air I am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for I am aware that M	75.04987335205078
de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness	197.0991973876953
Villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman	147.28981018066406
He glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic	370.5940246582031
He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered and said	183.80894470214844
You seem geographically engaged sir It is a rich study for you who as I learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map	161.76272583007812
Yes sir replied the count I have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individualsa physiological study	93.82585906982422
I have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole	137.37110900878906
It is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir I beg of you	393.8600158691406
Monte Cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when M	32.20698928833008
Villefort entered	47.3220100402832
Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	52.22263717651367
Ah you philosophize replied Villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you I had nothing else to do I should seek a more amusing occupation	92.46208190917969
Why in truth sir was Monte Cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said I think that I had nothing else to do	72.27928161621094
Now really let me ask sir have youdo you believe you have anything to do or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything	285.1183776855469
Villeforts astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary	195.5563201904297
It was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it	125.83589172363281
The procureur exerted himself to reply	74.3353500366211
Sir he responded you are a stranger and I believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and wellstudied course	113.00971221923828
Oh yesyes I do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients	17.36833381652832
I know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I have occupied myselfit is with the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice and I must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God	1885.291259765625
If this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do	205.6539306640625
It may perhaps come to this in time observed Monte Cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection	191.15017700195312
In the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic customs Roman laws and Frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it	62.847625732421875
I agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the French code I know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations	32.45231628417969
The English Turkish Japanese Hindu laws are as familiar to me as the French laws and thus I was right when I said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sirthat relatively to what I have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all I have learned you have yet a great deal to learn	110.53390502929688
But with what motive have you learned all this inquired Villefort in astonishment	62.79484558105469
Monte Cristo smiled	129.29502868652344
Really sir he observed I see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with manthat is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace	29.921390533447266
Pray sir explain yourself said Villefort more and more astonished I really donotunderstand youperfectly	42.67952346801758
I say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act I say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those officeholders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom God has put above those officeholders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fillI say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation	168.3762664794922
It is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs	28.580196380615234
Tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man	68.27372741699219
The nations took Attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say I am the angel of the Lord and the other I am the hammer of God in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed	47.046207427978516
Then said Villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned	39.01187515258789
And why not said Monte Cristo coldly	195.77577209472656
Your pardon sir replied Villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when I presented myself to you I was unaware that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men	27.091842651367188
It is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand I beg you to observe that I do not inquire I merely repeatit is not usual I say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world	126.10877990722656
Really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy	15.627569198608398
Sir said Villefort upon my word you overcome me	94.3932113647461
I really never heard a person speak as you do	134.09303283691406
Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings	1.1643235683441162
And you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us	105.35617065429688
Why should they not Can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist	113.2662353515625
Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude	71.20075225830078
Yes we do you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a material form	106.26586151123047
You touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you	176.11241149902344
Ah said Villefort smiling I confess I should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me	141.72801208496094
You have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and I now again warn you	96.74919891357422
Then you yourself are one of these marked beings	95.9740982055664
Yes monsieur I believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine	84.64847564697266
The dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	77.1313247680664
My kingdom is bounded only by the world for I am not an Italian or a Frenchman or a Hindu or an American or a SpaniardI am a cosmopolite	49.823482513427734
No country can say it saw my birth	75.268310546875
God alone knows what country will see me die	19.025440216064453
I adopt all customs speak all languages	49.733211517333984
You believe me to be a Frenchman for I speak French with the same facility and purity as yourself	73.09075164794922
Well Ali my Nubian believes me to be an Arab Bertuccio my steward takes me for a Roman Hayde my slave thinks me a Greek	83.02523803710938
You may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me	33.01024627685547
I have only two adversariesI will not say two conquerors for with perseverance I subdue even themthey are time and distance	73.67029571533203
There is a third and the most terriblethat is my condition as a mortal being	515.0709838867188
This alone can stop me in my onward career before I have attained the goal at which I aim for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms	80.16584777832031
What men call the chances of fatenamely ruin change circumstancesI have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	142.30255126953125
Unless I die I shall always be what I am and therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kingsfor kings have need and other persons have fear of you	95.11421966552734
For who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours Perhaps some day I shall have to do with the kings attorney	247.81192016601562
But can you not say that sir The moment you become an inhabitant of France you are naturally subjected to the French law	211.88534545898438
I know it sir replied Monte Cristo but when I visit a country I begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear till I know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	31.812198638916016
It follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom I should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should	349.8251037597656
That is to say replied Villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults	166.3746337890625
Faults or crimes responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air	115.5595474243164
And that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are perfect	417.55657958984375
No not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable that s all	231.21607971191406
But let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my secondsight	164.63136291503906
No noby no means said Villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground	173.29922485351562
No by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation	25.71160888671875
But you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and I will say to you rude as it may seem My brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is God	254.54856872558594
30029 m	81.76432800292969
Above us all sir was Monte Cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered	88.90312957763672
I have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot	43.198387145996094
But I lay aside that pride before God who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am	47.08346176147461
Then count I admire you said Villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur	51.865211486816406
Yes and I say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance	121.08306884765625
Yet you have unquestionably some ambition	77.68977355957031
I have sir	97.06221008300781
And what may it be	145.35678100585938
I too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by Satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me Child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me I reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then I replied ListenI have always heard of Providence and yet I have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists	125.18599700927734
I wish to be Providence myself for I feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish	87.74311828613281
Satan bowed his head and groaned	363.1903381347656
You mistake he said Providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of God is as invisible as the parent	75.87471008300781
You have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways	116.14649963378906
All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that Providence	60.73164367675781
The bargain was concluded	340.2481384277344
I may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added Monte Cristo	37.243412017822266
If the thing were to do again I would again do it	236.21168518066406
Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement	102.384033203125
Count he inquired have you any relations	47.989131927490234
No sir I am alone in the world	76.74486541748047
So much the worse	1079.8631591796875
Why asked Monte Cristo	134.2550811767578
Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	77.75785827636719
You say you fear nothing but death	50.441715240478516
I did not say that I feared it I only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans	126.96035766601562
And old age	19.464794158935547
My end will be achieved before I grow old	1.3350110054016113
And madness	72.82290649414062
I have been nearly mad and you know the axiomnon bis in idem	35.15964889526367
It is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application	78.9894027709961
30031 m	35.19776153564453
Sir continued Villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness	8.934331893920898
For instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end	56.62339401245117
You are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like Ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like Caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as I tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy	82.8058090209961
Come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and I will show you my father M	10.740104675292969
Noirtier de Villefort one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organizationa man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of God but of a supreme being not of Providence but of fate	111.33391571044922
Well sir the rupture of a bloodvessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second	58.19746780395508
Noirtier who on the previous night was the old Jacobin the old senator the old Carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerM	114.58412170410156
Noirtier playing with revolutionsM	53.177005767822266
Noirtier for whom France was a vast chessboard from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmatedM	50.843143463134766
Noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor M	161.8448944091797
Noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild Valentine a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay	188.80352783203125
Alas sir said Monte Cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought	75.97344207763672
I am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like Providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart	37.19788360595703
A hundred writers since Socrates Seneca St	360.2898864746094
Augustine and Gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet I can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son	98.23126983642578
I will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family	653.84423828125
It would have been so unquestionably had not God given me so large a compensation	139.84197998046875
In contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into lifeValentine the daughter by my first wifeMademoiselle Rene de SaintMranand Edward the boy whose life you have this day saved	250.20263671875
And what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired Monte Cristo	345.3858642578125
My deduction is replied Villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of God	219.09291076660156
That God desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone	98.3956298828125
Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it	140.9879913330078
Adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat I leave you bearing a remembrance of youa remembrance of esteem which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for I am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn	4726.50048828125
Besides you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort	82.72222137451172
The count bowed and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention	149.4453582763672
When he had gone Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh and said	87.59378814697266
Enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote	28.986351013183594
Then sounding his bell he said to Ali who entered	42.10734558105469
I am going to madames chamberhave the carriage ready at one oclock	39.617340087890625
Chapter 49	88.5137710571289
It will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo residing in the Rue Meslay were no other than Maximilian Julie and Emmanuel	52.513824462890625
The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visitsthe bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after Villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	391.4940185546875
Even Ali who had hastened to obey the Counts summons went forth from his masters presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patrons meditations whatever they were the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his masters happy reverie	264.5232238769531
It was noon and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of Hayde as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	208.4323272705078
The young Greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count	101.43843078613281
The rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose	72.24197387695312
Hayde had three French maids and one who was a Greek	205.9888916015625
The first three remained constantly in a small waitingroom ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistresss wishes to the three other waitingwomen the latter had received most peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Hayde with all the deference they would observe to a queen	104.32425689697266
The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	99.68578338623047
This was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored glass	248.77943420410156
Hayde was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water	132.52952575683594
Her attitude though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would in a European have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect	928.60986328125
Her dress which was that of the women of Epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for Parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls	130.39175415039062
She wore a blue and whitestriped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps	64.18340301513672
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles	329.966064453125
Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of goldcolored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue	433.5560302734375
The extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely Grecian there were the large dark melting eyes the finely formed nose the coral lips and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country	43.2388916015625
And to complete the whole Hayde was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers	47.126590728759766
Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit	229.85079956054688
Haydes only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girls picturesque attitude and appearance	40.05092239379883
As Monte Cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of Athens and Sparta	24.95054817199707
Why demand permission ere you enter Are you no longer my master or have I ceased to be your slave	68.80431365966797
Monte Cristo returned her smile	3441.108642578125
Hayde said he you well know	670.0768432617188
Why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young Greek	953.987060546875
Have I by any means displeased you Oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained	126.81110382080078
Hayde replied the count you know that you are now in France and are free	353.4764709472656
Free to do what asked the young girl	160.54713439941406
Free to leave me	71.67184448242188
Leave you Why should I leave you	71.36512756347656
That is not for me to say but we are now about to mix in societyto visit and be visited	405.06744384765625
I do nt wish to see anybody but you	136.846435546875
And should you see one whom you could prefer I would not be so unjust	96.71124267578125
I have never seen anyone I preferred to you and I have never loved anyone but you and my father	115.24369049072266
My poor child replied Monte Cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you	95.4587631225586
I do nt want anybody else to talk to me	153.56558227539062
My father said I was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child	83.0781478881836
Do you remember your father Hayde	145.70042419433594
The young Greek smiled	241.36862182617188
He is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart	71.59994506835938
And where am I inquired Monte Cristo laughingly	117.47794342041016
You cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek	68.23298645019531
You now understand Hayde said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination	84.61970520019531
Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you	78.72059631347656
A carriage waits your orders and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go	84.50151824951172
There is but one favor I would entreat of you	70.07994842529297
Guard carefully the secret of your birth	177.51095581054688
Make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or illfated mother	167.5303192138672
I have already told you my lord that I shall see no one	373.6547546386719
It is possible Hayde that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the East may not be practicable in Paris	56.388309478759766
Endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome Florence Milan and Madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the East	88.54872131347656
The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness Whether we return to the East you mean to say my lord do you not	111.75762176513672
My child returned Monte Cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerthe flower falls from the tree	43.61635208129883
My lord replied Hayde I never will leave you for I am sure I could not exist without you	231.70315551757812
My poor girl in ten years I shall be old and you will be still young	1.0699865818023682
My father had a long white beard but I loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw	220.0205841064453
Then tell me Hayde do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life	88.01506805419922
Shall I see you	227.17208862304688
Every day	101.95161437988281
Then what do you fear my lord	182.4988250732422
You might find it dull	331.471923828125
No my lord	402.9718017578125
In the morning I shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone I can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of Pindus and Olympus	136.49485778808594
Oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place	180.01486206054688
You are a worthy daughter of Epirus Hayde and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	156.16688537597656
Depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father I love you as a child	37.93342208862305
You are wrong my lord	237.2735137939453
The love I have for you is very different from the love I had for my father	104.77497100830078
My father died but I did not die	156.24681091308594
If you were to die I should die too	209.6061248779297
The count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips	190.1097412109375
Monte Cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own	82.5888900756836
The carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace	22.999797821044922
Chapter 50	1.2155708074569702
The Morrel Family	223.4335174560547
In a very few minutes the count reached No	102.3681640625
7 in the Rue Meslay	79.21394348144531
The house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	87.92207336425781
In the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized Cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years Cocles did not recognize the count	19.46640396118164
The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockworkan ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of The Little Versailles	111.77590942382812
It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin	59.208927154541016
The house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics	63.625247955322266
The whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by Emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation	32.7180061340332
He had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	159.59828186035156
So that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St	69.97169494628906
The breakfastroom was finished in oak the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask	82.258544921875
There was a study for Emmanuel who never studied and a musicroom for Julie who never played	86.44121551513672
The whole of the second story was set apart for Maximilian it was precisely similar to his sisters apartments except that for the breakfastparlor he had a billiardroom where he received his friends	247.9678192138672
He was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the counts carriage stopped at the gate	73.13739776611328
Cocles opened the gate and Baptistin springing from the box inquired whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo	1.6370776891708374
The Count of Monte Cristo cried Morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage I should think we would see him	116.13581848144531
Ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise	479.2112731933594
And the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure	205.01683044433594
Come come said Maximilian I will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant	39.282073974609375
My sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers la Presse and les Dbats within six steps of her for wherever you see Madame Herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find M	113.77310943603516
Emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the Polytechnic School	82.60649108886719
At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to fiveandtwenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rosetree raised her head	38.52774429321289
This was Julie who had become as the clerk of the house of Thomson   French had predicted Madame Emmanuel Herbault	68.31553649902344
She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and Maximilian began to laugh	42.646236419677734
Do nt disturb yourself Julie said he	114.41830444335938
The count has only been two or three days in Paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is and if he does not you will show him	31.365280151367188
Ah monsieur returned Julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister	63.7385139465332
Penelon Penelon	58.86320877075195
An old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek	66.62313079833984
A few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics	43.09233856201172
I think you hailed me Mademoiselle Julie said he	223.1085968017578
Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masters daughter Mademoiselle Julie and had never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault	263.63079833984375
Penelon replied Julie go and inform M	428.031982421875
Emmanuel of this gentlemans visit and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon	174.00852966308594
Then turning to Monte CristoI hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley	140.03616333007812
30041 m	385.345458984375
I am sorry to see observed Monte Cristo to Morrel that I cause no small disturbance in your house	188.26646423339844
Look there said Maximilian laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat	180.05804443359375
I assure you you are well known in the Rue Meslay	312.524169921875
Your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	227.0374755859375
Oh yes I assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twentyfive thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as Rothschild	355.462158203125
Fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied Monte Cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to Maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	56.559654235839844
Your brotherinlaw is a barrister a doctor	88.10391998291016
He was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father	1.0811094045639038
Morrel at his death left 500000 francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children	58.12738037109375
Her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	43.19871520996094
He labored and toiled until he had amassed 250000 francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	75.14305114746094
Oh I assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	29.744028091430664
Marseilles resounded with their wellearned praises	25.508323669433594
At last one day Emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts	34.25446701049805
Julie said he to her Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs that completes the 250000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains	79.26446533203125
Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future Listen to me	38.07181167602539
Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40000 francs	363.3209228515625
We can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for I have received a letter from M	51.472389221191406
Delaunay in which he offers to purchase the goodwill of the house to unite with his own for 300000 francs	39.303627014160156
Advise me what I had better do	64.64813232421875
Emmanuel returned my sister the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel	174.13229370117188
Is it not worth 300000 francs to save our fathers name from the chances of evil fortune and failure	59.54474639892578
I thought so replied Emmanuel but I wished to have your advice	313.50213623046875
This is my counselOur accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office	66.8083724975586
This was done instantly	249.61325073242188
It was three oclock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of 15000 francs	102.10647583007812
Monsieur said Emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to M	248.02447509765625
We have quitted business	233.36859130859375
How long inquired the astonished merchant	194.3470001220703
30043 m	77.7309799194336
A quarter of an hour was the reply	979.3442993164062
And this is the reason monsieur continued Maximilian of my sister and brotherinlaw having only 25000 francs a year	71.1392593383789
Maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat	77.52306365966797
He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden he returned to the house	187.89678955078125
A large vase of Japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon	58.4476203918457
Julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance	80.65213775634766
The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains	107.88307189941406
Everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	132.1766815185547
The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	168.0684051513672
The silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie	374.227294921875
Madame said he at length I pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband	22.34186363220215
We are very happy monsieur replied Julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves	109.5007553100586
The counts features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity	142.5438995361328
Oh all this is a family history as ChteauRenaud told you the other day observed Maximilian	22.74139404296875
This humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows	120.0366439819336
And God has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said Monte Cristo inquiringly	113.43730163574219
Yes count returned Julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels	103.46575927734375
The counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth	209.12989807128906
Those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said Emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather	183.92510986328125
Monte Cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step	166.64266967773438
Our magnificence makes you smile count said Maximilian who had followed him with his eyes	680.3453979492188
No no returned Monte Cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	324.68255615234375
I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other	97.20222473144531
Count replied Maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures	163.80819702148438
The stone seems very brilliant answered the count	359.8028564453125
Oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100000 francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now	50.91740798950195
This I do not comprehend and yet I may not ask for an explanation madame replied Monte Cristo bowing	742.1340942382812
Pardon me I had no intention of committing an indiscretion	59.852012634277344
Indiscretionoh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	114.26651000976562
If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view	85.09566497802734
Oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence	55.531959533691406
Ah really said Monte Cristo in a halfstifled voice	252.2115478515625
Monsieur returned Maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgracea man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot	1.0339713096618652
This letter as he spoke Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the countthis letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry	262.13897705078125
Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight	27.296138763427734
It was the letter written as our readers know to Julie and signed Sinbad the Sailor	128.23379516601562
Unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you	63.33332824707031
Yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued Maximilian	96.27133178710938
We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehendwe have been guided by an invisible handa hand as powerful as that of an enchanter	20.651531219482422
Oh cried Julie I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as I now kiss the purse which he has touched	85.73310852050781
Four years ago Penelon was at TriestePenelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardenerPenelon when he was at Trieste saw on the quay an Englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September	34.954864501953125
He felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him	51.0486946105957
An Englishman said Monte Cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at him	54.703739166259766
An Englishman you say	71.43775177001953
Yes replied Maximilian an Englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French at Rome	334.92437744140625
It was this that made me start when you said the other day at M	73.64540100097656
de Morcerfs that Messrs	1511.8577880859375
Thomson   French were your bankers	87.93767547607422
That happened as I told you in 1829	121.71641540527344
For Gods sake tell me did you know this Englishman	388.43829345703125
But you tell me also that the house of Thomson   French have constantly denied having rendered you this service	76.52433776855469
Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation	52.216251373291016
Everything is possible in this affair even a miracle	85.4659652709961
What was his name asked Monte Cristo	43.219154357910156
He gave no other name answered Julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterSinbad the Sailor	78.76080322265625
Which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one	39.809730529785156
Then noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice	192.4087677001953
Tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil	210.667236328125
Oh do you then know him cried Julie whose eyes sparkled with joy	83.90851593017578
No returned Monte Cristo I only guessed	52.22447967529297
I knew a Lord Wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind	96.84501647949219
Without revealing himself	69.16863250732422
He was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude	101.20376586914062
Oh Heaven exclaimed Julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then	36.903133392333984
30047 m	11.373861312866211
He did not credit it at the period which I knew him said Monte Cristo touched to the heart by the accents of Julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist	336.97662353515625
And do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired Emmanuel	47.17873001098633
Oh if you do know him cried Julie can you tell us where he iswhere we can find him MaximilianEmmanuelif we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart	108.76270294189453
Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	261.4111328125
In the name of Heaven said Maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is	98.50853729248047
Alas cried Monte Cristo striving to repress his emotion if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor I fear you will never see him again	108.25543975830078
I parted from him two years ago at Palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that I fear he will never return	266.89605712890625
Oh monsieur this is cruel of you said Julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	69.13394165039062
Madame replied Monte Cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julies cheeks had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to Julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count	164.7537841796875
But continued she Lord Wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not	130.78599548339844
Oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for	85.94464111328125
He was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me	461.5868835449219
And he told you nothing	7.24506139755249
Not a word	33.95069122314453
Nothing that would lead you to suppose	147.16322326660156
And yet you spoke of him at once	35.88429260253906
Ah in such a case one supposes	88.26782989501953
Sister sister said Maximilian coming to the counts aid monsieur is quite right	333.8995056152344
Recollect what our excellent father so often told us It was no Englishman that thus saved us	140.15567016601562
Monte Cristo started	99.99075317382812
What did your father tell you M	105.75904846191406
Morrel said he eagerly	83.3310317993164
My father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us	56.28437805175781
Oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although I did not myself believe it I would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith	2106.236572265625
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear frienda friend lost to him forever and on his deathbed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were Maximilian it was Edmond Dants	72.7038345336914
At these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to Madame Herbault and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and MaximilianMadame said he I trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally I value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that I have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	10.689953804016113
This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man said Emmanuel	305.73907470703125
Yes answered Maximilian but I feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us	32.759918212890625
His voice went to my heart observed Julie and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before	113.22486877441406
Chapter 51	43.18027114868164
Pyramus and Thisbe	48.853179931640625
About twothirds of the way along the Faubourg SaintHonor and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the widespreading chestnuttrees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of Louis XIII	70.45124816894531
This noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse	22.912992477416992
The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the Faubourg SaintHonor and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchengarden of about an acre	72.26374816894531
For the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchengarden	89.15151977539062
The street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg SaintHonor itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris	325.2718505859375
In matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes	64.2175064086914
From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchengarden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some marketgardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs	33.54322814941406
And so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchengarden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet	219.1890411376953
True the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	177.2518768310547
Horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchengarden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation	21.58297348022461
A small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the onehalf per cent it had originally paid	90.7828598022461
Towards the house the chestnuttrees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air	28.869600296020508
At one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off	225.50689697265625
Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	147.6846923828125
On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a workbasket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planksthe earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter	102.29927062988281
At that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared	51.84469985961914
He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	116.44184875488281
After casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	24.913148880004883
At the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat	183.03236389160156
But the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash	57.97651672363281
Pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed	60.78877639770508
Do nt be alarmed Valentineit is I	92.373291015625
Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so	139.1376190185547
And why do you come so late today It is almost dinnertime and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my toodevoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which I am in a fair way never to get done	1.0061495304107666
So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you	57.46963119506836
Dearest Valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet I can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly I adore you	132.29995727539062
If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments I could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least I was in your thoughts	61.27808380126953
You asked me the cause of my being late and why I come disguised	47.75322723388672
I will candidly explain the reason of both and I trust to your goodness to pardon me	22.58016014099121
I have chosen a trade	415.85589599609375
A trade Oh Maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness	188.264404296875
Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself But listen to me Valentine and I will tell you all about it	106.08562469482422
I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief	62.54144287109375
That would compromise the honor of the French army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so I have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling	76.16837310791016
What excessive nonsense you talk Maximilian	100.6864242553711
Nonsense Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	166.8350067138672
Consider by becoming a gardener I effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger	118.28800201416016
30053 m	182.50457763671875
I beseech of you Maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean	121.79857635498047
Simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let I made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern	87.06922149658203
Think of that Valentine There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you	56.56027603149414
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me	191.9493865966797
I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	60.584102630615234
Such felicity seems above all priceas a thing impossible and unattainable	175.3395233154297
But would you believe that I purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly Henceforth we have nothing to fear	139.9555206298828
I am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when I please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	59.612701416015625
I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap	172.48439025878906
A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart	70.9986572265625
Alas no Maximilian this must not be for many reasons	158.88839721679688
We should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence	105.05242156982422
How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear Valentine Have I not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas And you have I am sure the fullest confidence in my honor	122.06282806396484
When you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have I ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you You told me my dear Valentine that you were engaged to M	142.16268920898438
dpinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as M	125.54508972167969
de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	51.62881088256836
I kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor	211.76473999023438
But what cared I for delays or difficulties Valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me If you will only repeat that avowal now and then I can endure anything	419.6101989746094
Ah Maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as I now am insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both	175.05740356445312
I will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust	90.7610855102539
Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time Valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave I not obeyed And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateto be close to you without really seeing youhave I ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me	103.18394470214844
I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times	30.694753646850586
Come come dearest Valentine confess that what I say is true lest I be tempted to call you unjust	51.46318435668945
30055 m	116.09904479980469
It is true said Valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from motives of selfinterest my dear Maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us	122.93936920166016
You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother	95.8531723022461
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild	68.67903900146484
Oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse Indeed indeed Maximilian I am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity	17.39893341064453
Valentine replied the young man deeply affected I will not say you are all I love in the world for I dearly prize my sister and brotherinlaw but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what I feel for you	27.707965850830078
When I think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and I can hardly breathe but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you	127.32915496826172
Franz is not expected to return home for a year to come I am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us	151.99600219726562
Let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter	378.4551696777344
Meanwhile Valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to methe beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus	24.81360626220703
What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evincednone whatever	60.44490432739258
What granted mescarcely more	102.22032165527344
You tell me of M	129.0495147705078
Franz dpinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me Valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart You see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yoursthat were I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another Oh Valentine were I in your place and did I feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars and said Take this hand dearest Maximilian and believe that living or dead I am yoursyours only and forever	98.94998168945312
The poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears	129.77593994140625
A rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	68.0192642211914
Dearest dearest Valentine exclaimed he forgive me if I have offended you and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain	48.98060989379883
No Maximilian I am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being I am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fathers house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself	85.17198181152344
Outwardly and in the eyes of the world I am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	38.83256912231445
The general remark is Oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as M	168.2822723388672
Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	90.54556274414062
What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort	85.63158416748047
The world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile	84.93132781982422
Hate you sweet Valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that	88.65577697753906
Alas replied the weeping girl I am obliged to own that my stepmothers aversion to me arises from a very natural sourceher overweening love for her own child my brother Edward	90.29045104980469
But why should it	54.83165740966797
I do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation I will just say this muchthat her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and I much fear she envies me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of M	36.34716796875
and Mme	78.28894805908203
de SaintMran whose sole heiress I am	129.34417724609375
Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed	21.70155143737793
Alas how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love	196.9471893310547
God knows I would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home	144.2572479248047
Poor Valentine	273.3341064453125
I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held lest I fall utterly helpless	103.15255737304688
Then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is allpowerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	119.76431274414062
Dear Maximilian believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own	265.7976989746094
But why Valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy a future	82.47137451171875
Because I judge it from the past	115.27253723144531
Still consider that although I may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you I am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance	204.92465209960938
The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire	48.76491165161133
The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon	72.62095642089844
Now I belong to this lastnamed class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain	27.639122009277344
My fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country Valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city I say our country because you were born not far from Marseilles	391.14044189453125
Do nt speak of Marseilles I beg of you Maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my recollectionmy angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now I fondly hope watches from her home in heaven	258.1794128417969
Oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear Maximilian for I would tell her that I loved you and she would protect us	103.7608642578125
I fear Valentine replied the lover that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me	47.4681396484375
Now it is you who are unjust Maximilian cried Valentine but there is one thing I wish to know	147.09005737304688
And what is that inquired the young man perceiving that Valentine hesitated	22.376428604125977
Tell me truly Maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them	26072.19921875
Not that I am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any illfeeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the Bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them	86.59745025634766
But why do you ask	64.69071197509766
I will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know	83.914794921875
Well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather M	1.007332682609558
Noirtier M	107.9867172241211
Danglars was there alsoyou recollect M	124.77217864990234
Danglars do you not Maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars I was reading the paper to my grandfather but when I came to the paragraph about you although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening I felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that I really think I should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so I summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as I could	700.0145874023438
30059 m	38.90156936645508
Dear Valentine	453.7020568847656
Well would you believe it directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that I was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but I even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that M	198.86703491210938
Danglars trembled too	2694.00244140625
Morrel Morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent BonapartismI mean about the year 1815	116.83979797363281
Yes replied M	180.55662536621094
Danglars I believe he is the son of the old shipowner	14.606537818908691
Indeed answered Maximilian and what did your father say then Valentine	46.047855377197266
Oh such a dreadful thing that I do nt dare to tell you	270.9762878417969
Always tell me everything said Maximilian with a smile	67.49736785888672
Ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain	48.9608039855957
Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country	32.49282455444336
Brutal politics I must confess	10.407888412475586
said Maximilian but do nt attach any serious importance dear to what your father said	76.91731262207031
My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk	112.45608520507812
Why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men You see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party	117.17835998535156
But what did M	61.63642501831055
Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur	110.86502838134766
Oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfhalfmalicious halfferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time I observed the agitation of my grandfather and I must tell you Maximilian that I am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame	332.58477783203125
And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner	99.02153778076172
The name of M	1.1032882928848267
Noirtier interposed Maximilian is celebrated throughout Europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know Valentine that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons	70.47144317626953
Oh I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strangethe father a Bonapartist the son a Royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics But to resume my story I turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper I had been reading	99.190673828125
What is the matter dear grandfather said I are you pleased He gave me a sign in the affirmative	78.5032958984375
With what my father said just now He returned a sign in the negative	42.61266326904297
Perhaps you liked what M	137.01295471191406
Danglars said Another sign in the negative	64.81412506103516
Oh then you were glad to hear that M	89.23899841308594
Morrel I did nt dare to say Maximilian had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor He signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but I love him for showing so much interest in you	72.9483413696289
How singular murmured Maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contraryWhat strange feelings are aroused by politics	38.32686233520508
Hush cried Valentine suddenly someone is coming Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it	1.0304831266403198
Mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees	65.03873443603516
Madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawingroom	62.97842788696289
A visitor inquired Valentine much agitated who is it	31.681875228881836
Some grand personagea prince I believe they saidthe Count of Monte Cristo	57.07637023925781
I will come directly cried Valentine aloud	79.1806411743164
The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom Valentines I am coming was the customary signal of farewell	101.00066375732422
Now then said Maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M	45.08478546142578
de Villefort	146.2017822265625
Chapter 52	71.34111022949219
It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	60.695858001708984
Madame de Villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and Edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say	170.99029541015625
Oh that naughty child But I ca nt be severe with him he is really so bright	18.956899642944336
After the usual civilities the count inquired after M	14.903477668762207
de Villefort	27.986608505249023
My husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and I am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went	42.95169448852539
Two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires	53.020118713378906
What is your sister Valentine doing inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward tell someone to bid her come here that I may have the honor of introducing her to the count	47.07864761352539
You have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young I presume	151.1800079345703
The daughter of M	83.34319305419922
de Villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine wellgrown girl	37.54823303222656
But melancholy interrupted Master Edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	36.98724365234375
Madame de Villefort merely cried Be still Edward She then added This young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for Mademoiselle de Villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	165.2060546875
But what detains her Go Edward and see	85.05692291259766
Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found	47.87544631958008
And where are they looking for her	56.995052337646484
With grandpapa Noirtier	77.08396911621094
And do you think she is not there	225.03555297851562
No no no no no she is not there replied Edward singing his words	133.91380310058594
And where is she then If you know why do nt you tell	92.86669158935547
She is under the big chestnuttree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mothers commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare	82.28753662109375
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waitingmaid to the spot where she would find Valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	112.52710723876953
She appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	175.57704162597656
Valentine whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eyes and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother	17.06482696533203
Her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan	94.23944854736328
She entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the counts attention	40.819644927978516
He rose to return the salutation	54.30733108520508
Mademoiselle de Villefort my stepdaughter said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her hand	91.83226776123047
And M	257.1372985839844
de Monte Cristo King of China Emperor of CochinChina said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister	17.149389266967773
Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of Edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	131.94313049316406
But madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before I could not help thinking so just now the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark	80.13175964355469
I do not think it likely sir Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady	41.36361312866211
Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	1872.657470703125
Besides the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as I believe I told you I have been in Paris but very few days	70.3969497680664
Nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay	39.308753967285156
The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	65.7004165649414
Noit was somewhereaway from hereit wasI do not knowbut it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fte mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor	92.7822494506836
Pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory	184.8009490966797
No indeed replied Madame de Villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if I had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory	460.8078918457031
Perhaps the count saw us in Italy said Valentine timidly	32.56358337402344
Yes in Italy it was in Italy most probably replied Monte Cristo you have travelled then in Italy mademoiselle	78.33233642578125
Yes madame and I were there two years ago	30.83731460571289
The doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of Naples	175.6771240234375
We went by Bologna Perugia and Rome	82.98652648925781
Ah yestrue mademoiselle exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought	19.851045608520508
It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day in the garden of the Htel des Postes when chance brought us together you Madame de Villefort and her son I now remember having had the honor of meeting you	346.42828369140625
I perfectly well remember Perugia sir and the Htel des Postes and the festival of which you speak said Madame de Villefort but in vain do I tax my memory of whose treachery I am ashamed for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before	195.52517700195312
It is strange but neither do I recollect meeting with you observed Valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count	126.83414459228516
30065 m	110.1399917602539
But I remember it perfectly interposed the darling Edward	163.10928344726562
I will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	92.8110122680664
Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock	154.51840209960938
And I caught it mamma do nt you remember interposed Edward and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail	19.445636749267578
You madame remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as I told you Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody	186.54661560058594
Yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red I do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical man I think	249.42396545410156
Precisely so madame this man was myself for a fortnight I had been at that hotel during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that I really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician	68.70903778076172
We discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of Perugino of Raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua Tofana of which they had told you I think you said that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret	66.69922637939453
Yes true replied Madame de Villefort somewhat uneasily I remember now	26.348270416259766
I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but I perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de Villefort	32.46867752075195
Yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said Madame de Villefort since you had cured the sick	36.15408706665039
Molire or Beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because I was not that I had cured my patients for myself I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand	47.591522216796875
At this moment the clock struck six	67.07545471191406
It is six oclock said Madame de Villefort evidently agitated	72.49055480957031
Valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner	73.77727508544922
Valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking	77.72993469238281
Oh madame said the count when Valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away	31.87057113647461
By no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give M	76.24239349365234
Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	87.78240966796875
You are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbands father	116.8180160522461
Yes madame M	104.78382110595703
de Villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis I think	79.17587280273438
Alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	126.93106079101562
But excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes I interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist	1.0773371458053589
No madame I did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary	65.01898193359375
I have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following the example of King Mithridates	34.96073913574219
Mithridates rex Ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast	119.23280334472656
Edward you naughty boy exclaimed Madame de Villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchins grasp you are positively past bearing you really disturb the conversation go leave us and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtiers room	72.51465606689453
The album said Edward sulkily	345.29034423828125
What do you meanthe album	46.92792892456055
I want the album	80.64920806884766
How dare you tear out the drawings	10.2107572555542
Oh it amuses me	61.963287353515625
Gogo at once	111.52493286132812
I wo nt go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way	104.32803344726562
Take it then and pray disturb us no longer said Madame de Villefort giving the album to Edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	47.567359924316406
The count followed her with his eyes	44.358516693115234
Let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	155.20130920410156
Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself	41.66566848754883
Allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child	32.01662063598633
Oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied Madame de Villefort with all a mothers real firmness	52.44024658203125
It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he referred to King Mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years	157.80955505371094
The fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him	42.22547149658203
He has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that Mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious	114.91860961914062
I think so madame because I myself have made use of them that I might not be poisoned at Naples at Palermo and at Smyrnathat is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions I must have lost my life	118.59761047363281
And your precautions were successful	2988.233154296875
Completely so	146.2825927734375
Yes I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this sort	40.03240966796875
Indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited I really did not remember	15.268519401550293
I inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the North as on men of the South and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South	1242.9556884765625
And that is the case observed Monte Cristo	9579.01171875
I have seen Russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab	136.71241760253906
And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the East and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison	17.652353286743164
Certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed	53.46742248535156
Yes I understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it	216.07449340820312
Oh very easily	540.07861328125
Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine	179.60940551757812
Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not inquired Madame de Villefort	139.9437713623047
Precisely madame replied Monte Cristo but I perceive I have not much to teach you	104.00304412841797
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies	135.6165008544922
Oh I am aware of that said Madame de Villefort but I have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on I beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree	17.68083953857422
30069 m	110.56674194335938
Well replied Monte Cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on	48.96780776977539
Well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	103.67041778564453
Well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water	122.78570556640625
Do you know any other counterpoisons	37.4476203918457
I do not	181.23849487304688
I have often read and read again the history of Mithridates said Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable	91.63188934326172
No madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind	85.94156646728516
True sir	637.7098388671875
The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when I learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the East as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair I have regretted that I was not a man that I might have been a Flamel a Fontana or a Cabanis	285.33355712890625
And the more madame said Monte Cristo as the Orientals do not confine themselves as did Mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger	159.53451538085938
Science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies	25.85030746459961
With opium belladonna brucea snakewood and the cherrylaurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way	27.202068328857422
There is not one of those women Egyptian Turkish or Greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor	191.74227905273438
Really said Madame de Villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation	419.2248229980469
Oh yes indeed madame continued Monte Cristo the secret dramas of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potionbegin with paradise and end withhell	116.97972106933594
There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and I will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance	1163.738525390625
But sir remarked the young woman these Eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	131.60934448242188
A man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the Bagdad and Bassora of the Thousand and One Nights	202.2694854736328
The sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in France we call the government are really HarounalRaschids and Giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui	60.408164978027344
By no means madame the fanciful exists no longer in the East	73.86685180664062
There disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneysgeneral and bailiffs	68.36034393310547
They hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems	26.411239624023438
Amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocers or druggists gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenicif he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily tracedthen when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood	190.24195861816406
Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables	67.71891021728516
They fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	23.45383644104004
Next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer	192.71408081054688
The same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty	76.88790130615234
Then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life	141.01602172851562
This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry madame	185.27369689941406
Desrues was however I must confess more skilful	58.808753967285156
What would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can	49.534217834472656
All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias	71.87500762939453
Now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall I tell you the cause of all these stupidities It is because at your theatres by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly	67.98885345458984
Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	66.98650360107422
They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying	103.21085357666016
But go a little way from Francego either to Aleppo or Cairo or only to Naples or Rome and you will see people passing by you in the streetspeople erect smiling and freshcolored of whom Asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say That man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month	1.1057616472244263
Then remarked Madame de Villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua Tofana that they said was lost at Perugia	22.40768814086914
Ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything The arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow themthat is all but there is always the same result	75.85253143310547
Poisons act particularly on some organ or anotherone on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines	133.62681579589844
Well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy Abb Adelmonte of Taormina in Sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly	82.79222869873047
It is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	131.49066162109375
I thought I must confess that these tales were inventions of the Middle Ages	44.76694107055664
Yes no doubt but improved upon by ours	139.25753784179688
What is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses Monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection Yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle	30.95368194580078
So added Madame de Villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the Borgias the Medicis the Renes the Ruggieris and later probably that of Baron de Trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance	177.20262145996094
Were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count	191.402099609375
Do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual By no means	32.28544616699219
Science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if I may be allowed so to term them	80.19513702392578
Thus for instance the excellent Abb Adelmonte of whom I spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments	163.1082000732422
Yes I will mention one to you	157.4429168701172
He had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit	241.0484161376953
From amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for instance	211.18350219726562
For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow	121.5776138305664
At that moment he cut it	82.85617065429688
In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance	195.844482421875
It was only poisoned to the Abb Adelmonte	42.54860305786133
He then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsfor the Abb Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guineapigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit	22.708450317382812
Well the Abb Adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage	125.94027709960938
The rabbit died	106.5208969116211
What magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M	47.81230545043945
Magendie or M	262.04449462890625
Flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guineapigs they have killednot one	45.54125213623047
So then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice	72.76366424560547
This rabbit dead the Abb Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day	96.26899719238281
At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in Adelmontes country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey	112.82308959960938
Three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fishpond	68.451416015625
The pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knowswell they feast on the vulture	68.80648040771484
Now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table	56.79567337036133
Well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus	63.74556350708008
The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning The subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever	20.404150009155273
But remarked Madame de Villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fishpond	99.6290512084961
Ah that is where the art comes in	105.05377960205078
To be a great chemist in the East one must direct chance and this is to be achieved	27.64436149597168
Madame de Villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively	113.35824584960938
But she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death	80.89563751220703
Precisely so cried Monte Cristoprecisely so and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte	133.8631134033203
He reflected smiled and replied to me by a Sicilian proverb which I believe is also a French proverb My son the world was not made in a daybut in seven	36.33073043823242
Return on Sunday	26.052736282348633
On the Sunday following I did return to him	23.6126766204834
Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it	46.13296127319336
Now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead	79.37483215332031
The fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen	40.46729278564453
This time we were the vultures so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms	130.53919982910156
There was no peculiar indication in any organan excitement of the nervous systemthat was it a case of cerebral congestionnothing more	40.495849609375
The fowl had not been poisonedshe had died of apoplexy	37.23541259765625
Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls I believe but very common among men	905.5471801757812
Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful	59.50046920776367
It is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other	147.0330352783203
By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said Monte Cristo carelessly	73.95073699951172
And then said Madame de Villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of God	5.879745006561279
The Orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hellthat is the point	75.52943420410156
30075 m	61.52983093261719
Really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning	9.514402389526367
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseauyou rememberthe mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger	175.9579620361328
Mans whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them	306.0758972167969
You will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellowcreature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	113.84414672851562
Such a thing is really out of ruleeccentric or stupid	148.52239990234375
To attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirtysix degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit	39.35770797729492
But suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them	75.02465057373047
Then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the actthen one escapes the clutch of the human law which says Do not disturb society This is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in Eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance	82.1307373046875
Yet conscience remains remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh	27.438997268676758
Yes answered Monte Cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be After every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives	188.64183044433594
Thus Richard III	39.73568344116211
for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV	569.58837890625
in fact he could say These two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensitiesthese two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused	86.87388610839844
Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever Shakespeare may say a throne	77.8137435913086
Ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motiveso powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after Duncans death Lady Macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience	55.40753936767578
Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him	56.27361297607422
After a moments silence the lady inquired	205.11048889160156
Do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium Have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles For you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneously	415.577392578125
30077 m	200.43927001953125
Oh do not place any reliance on that madame one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him	268.56561279296875
You know madame how suddenly I snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched	85.58259582519531
Is it then so terrible a poison	46.37886047363281
Oh no In the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies	114.87641906738281
What then is it	10.471565246582031
A skilful preparation of my friends the worthy Abb Adelmonte who taught me the use of it	346.8965759277344
Oh observed Madame de Villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic	7.316483020782471
Perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and I frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	272.4560241699219
Most assuredly responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone	24.29669952392578
As for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits I should require a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear I have of dying some fine day of suffocation	1.0430634021759033
In the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in France and your abb is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account I must continue to use Monsieur Planches antispasmodics and mint and Hoffmans drops are among my favorite remedies	22.515676498413086
Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong	5852.451171875
Monte Cristo opened the tortoiseshell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition	18.87859535217285
They are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutitiona function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishI prefer my own specific	101.79389190673828
Undoubtedly and so should I prefer it after the effects I have seen produced but of course it is a secret and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you	110.94107055664062
But I said Monte Cristo rising as he spokeI am gallant enough to offer it you	178.94822692871094
30079 m	7.287875175476074
How kind you are	135.98846435546875
Only remember one thinga small dose is a remedy a large one is poison	60.36310577392578
One drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	198.77365112304688
But I say no more madame it is really as if I were prescribing for you	72.50261688232422
The clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of Madame de Villefort who came to dine with her	290.60821533203125
If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said Madame de Villefort if I had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you I should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal	290.0439453125
A thousand thanks madame replied Monte Cristo but I have an engagement which I can not break	72.82294464111328
I have promised to escort to the Acadmie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither	16.99579429626465
Adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription	84.73214721679688
Ah in truth madame to do that I must forget the hours conversation I have had with you which is indeed impossible	42.85629653930664
Monte Cristo bowed and left the house	124.79115295410156
Madame de Villefort remained immersed in thought	110.22252655029297
He is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the Adelmonte he talks about	78.84246063232422
As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations	1032.4625244140625
Good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground	159.9617156982422
Next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	1506.1768798828125
Chapter 53	130.62774658203125
Robert le Diable	50.14032745361328
The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Acadmie Royale	115.8576431274414
Levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of Bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience	63.31349182128906
Morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box	56.514068603515625
ChteauRenaud rented a stall beside his own while Beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre	92.96221923828125
It happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by Mercds sent it to Danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	63.27256774902344
The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	90.52596282958984
To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	13.975733757019043
Danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to Lucien Debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugnie to the opera	24.41059684753418
There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mothers admitted lover enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and illnature	34.669639587402344
One must take the world as one finds it	62.32186508178711
30083 m	176.7713623046875
The curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation	14.765743255615234
Surely said Albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the Countess G	7207.623046875
And who is the Countess G inquired ChteauRenaud	21.098617553710938
What a question Now do you know baron I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the Countess G was	31.206499099731445
Ah to be sure replied ChteauRenaud the lovely Venetian is it not	119.41664123535156
At this moment the countess perceived Albert and returned his salutation with a smile	125.91788482666016
You know her it seems said ChteauRenaud	255.28738403320312
Franz introduced me to her at Rome replied Albert	63.99810791015625
Well then will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome	67.0348129272461
With pleasure	158.73277282714844
There was a cry of Shut up from the audience	136.30181884765625
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	103.09232330322266
The countess was present at the races in the ChampdeMars said ChteauRenaud	38.22158432006836
Bless me I quite forgot the races	228.777587890625
Did you bet	3.788978099822998
Oh merely a paltry fifty louis	65.23811340332031
And who was the winner	1.7778596878051758
I staked on him	279.6098327636719
But there were three races were there not	46.01184844970703
Yes there was the prize given by the Jockey Cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that race	20.641014099121094
What was it	121.71845245361328
Oh shut up again interposed some of the audience	230.60379028320312
Why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course	92.3890609741211
Is that possible	35.26530456542969
True as day	6.884816646575928
The fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa or that of a jockey styled Job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the startingpost	1106.3150634765625
They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths	19.767860412597656
And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged	104.08064270019531
You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa	238.5686492919922
Exactly that was the title	40.77721405029297
Then answered Albert I am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was	50.42094421386719
Shut up there cried the pit in chorus	63.002037048339844
And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	461.5868835449219
Leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	221.84608459472656
At this moment the door of the ministers box opened and Madame Danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by Lucien Debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	42.84865188598633
Ha ha said ChteauRenaud here come some friends of yours viscount What are you looking at there do nt you see they are trying to catch your eye	136.5935516357422
Albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for Mademoiselle Eugnie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage	18.259952545166016
I tell you what my dear fellow said ChteauRenaud I can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglarsthat is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way I do nt think you care very much about	47.15306854248047
Now barring all that I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl	32.34464645385742
Handsome certainly replied Albert but not to my taste which I confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine	36.113887786865234
Ah well exclaimed ChteauRenaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of Diana the huntress and yet you are not content	63.37066650390625
No for that very resemblance affrights me I should have liked something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua but this chaseloving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Acton	34.49203109741211
And indeed it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerfs remark	39.982120513916016
She was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by wellarched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sexher nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled Juno	32.36484146118164
Her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion	216.49806213378906
But that which completed the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of selfdependence that characterized her countenance	47.345462799072266
The rest of Mademoiselle Eugnies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of Diana as ChteauRenaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute	112.73978424072266
As regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	54.7969970703125
She was a perfect linguist a firstrate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellowa young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer	71.77596282958984
It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence	122.48933410644531
But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company	70.30472564697266
Still though not actually received at the Htel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	45.31053924560547
The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed halfhours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	242.0547332763672
Morcerf and ChteauRenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	37.13499069213867
For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them	417.94342041015625
Mademoiselle Eugnie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the Countess G and where Morcerf had just made his appearance	2333.577880859375
30087 m	56.808349609375
So we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me	48.94194412231445
Be assured replied Albert that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris and had known your address I should have paid my respects to you before this	21.096328735351562
Allow me to introduce my friend Baron de ChteauRenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the ChampdeMars yesterday	76.71062469482422
ChteauRenaud bowed to the countess	99.27523040771484
So you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly	43.67893600463867
Yes madame	39.04241943359375
Well then pursued Madame G with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes	282.48577880859375
I am sorry to say I can not replied the baron and I was just asking the same question of Albert	60.02057647705078
Are you very anxious to know countess asked Albert	12.928752899169922
To know what	310.8659362792969
The name of the owner of the winning horse	19.861963272094727
Excessively only imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no	71.85811614990234
I beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not You said only imagineand then paused	166.03219604492188
Pray continue	259.83941650390625
Well then listen	6.547684669494629
You must know I felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that I could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when I saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winningpost in such gallant style I actually clapped my hands with joy	165.5374755859375
Imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket I concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as I entered my apartments I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider	24.037092208862305
Inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsFrom Lord Ruthven to Countess G	162.62730407714844
Precisely I was sure of it said Morcerf	126.06068420410156
Sure of what	133.19398498535156
That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself	218.50123596191406
What Lord Ruthven do you mean	51.36174392700195
Why our Lord Ruthventhe Vampire of the Salle Argentina	128.57937622070312
Is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in Paris	66.20475769042969
To be surewhy not	126.8023910522461
And you visit himmeet him at your own house and elsewhere	31.060136795043945
I assure you he is my most intimate friend and M	241.81744384765625
de ChteauRenaud has also the honor of his acquaintance	104.43962097167969
But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club prize	7.027451038360596
Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa	46.099308013916016
What of that	111.78907012939453
Why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner	179.49697875976562
Oh yes	34.27848815917969
And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner	41.51530075073242
To be sure I remember it all now	105.80902862548828
He called himself Vampa	119.76923370361328
You see its evident where the count got the name	68.12836456298828
But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me	86.02837371826172
In the first place because I had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success	51.58685302734375
I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him	51.07421112060547
I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not	186.23818969726562
Besides his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven	37.01353454589844
Oh but that is dreadful Why the man must owe me a fearful grudge	9.988279342651367
Does his action appear like that of an enemy	30.701723098754883
No certainly not	132.40591430664062
Well then	191.30072021484375
And so he is in Paris	108.49935913085938
And what effect does he produce	26.41166114807129
Why said Albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of England took place followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Marss diamonds and so people talked of something else	30.102739334106445
My good fellow said ChteauRenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	477.80755615234375
Do not believe what Albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever	92.8780746459961
His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32000 francs to Madame Danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club	204.35684204101562
I therefore maintain in spite of Morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence	182.2994842529297
Perhaps you are right said Morcerf meanwhile who is in the Russian ambassadors box	118.19710540771484
Which box do you mean asked the countess	1.066410779953003
The one between the pillars on the first tierit seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh	166.2733612060547
Did you observe anyone during the first act asked ChteauRenaud	387.43328857421875
In that box	21.24721908569336
No replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize	403.4328308105469
I am sure of it	65.60137176513672
And who afterwards sent the cup to me	127.49775695800781
But I do nt know him said the countess I have a great mind to return it	44.91632080078125
Do no such thing I beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby	33.15314865112305
It is his way and you must take him as you find him	103.22970581054688
At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act	102.58302307128906
Albert rose to return to his place	112.0060806274414
Shall I see you again asked the countess	57.906288146972656
At the end of the next act with your permission I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris	48.734867095947266
Pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening	21.903654098510742
So now you are both forewarned	182.1237030029297
The young men bowed and quitted the box	37.122825622558594
Upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador	77.88168334960938
A man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style	74.01582336425781
The lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	90.45304107666016
Hullo said Albert it is Monte Cristo and his Greek	45.132171630859375
The strangers were indeed no other than the count and Hayde	42.57736587524414
In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	20.087068557739258
The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle	96.054443359375
Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given	30.609683990478516
At the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	21.742345809936523
Having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to Debray	837.6883544921875
By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while Eugnie received him with her accustomed coldness	837.6883544921875
My dear fellow said Debray you have come in the nick of time	229.409423828125
There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going	96.7677001953125
Being no disciple of Cagliostro I was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape I said Ask Morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you	56.86813735961914
Is it not almost incredible said Madame Danglars that a person having at least half a million of secretservice money at his command should possess so little information	39993.29296875
Let me assure you madame said Lucien that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	67.51223754882812
However I have turned the business over to Morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings	213.13018798828125
30093 m	46.192100524902344
I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5000 francs each	60.66020965576172
He seems to have a mania for diamonds said Morcerf smiling and I verily believe that like Potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as Tom Thumb did his flint stones	113.8058853149414
Perhaps he has discovered some mine said Madame Danglars	104.43035888671875
I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment	28.991832733154297
I was not aware of it replied Albert but I can readily believe it	45.69294738769531
And further that he stated to M	33.52327346801758
Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions	153.59420776367188
He must be the Shah of Persia travelling incog	131.0714874267578
Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman M	62.702301025390625
Lucien inquired Eugnie	352.402099609375
I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded Lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye	165.9884796142578
A most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	109.20733642578125
Who is this young person M	89.80854797363281
de Morcerf inquired Eugnie does anybody know	72.93421936035156
Mademoiselle said Albert replying to this direct appeal I can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversingthe young woman is a Greek	397.1101989746094
So I should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as yourself	6027.89501953125
I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied Morcerf but I am reluctantly obliged to confess I have nothing further to communicateyes stay I do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count I heard the sound of a guzlait is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own	56.96024703979492
Then your count entertains visitors does he asked Madame Danglars	65.34527587890625
Indeed he does and in a most lavish manner I can assure you	103.78372955322266
I must try and persuade M	40.13430404663086
Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return	36.40235900878906
What said Debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house	47.97947692871094
Why not my husband could accompany me	65.13472747802734
But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor	119.74085235595703
You have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek	38.76007080078125
No no exclaimed Debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave	164.36952209472656
Do you not recollect Morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast	26.487035751342773
Well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess	35.481170654296875
Of the Arabian Nights	38.77492141723633
If you like but tell me my dear Lucien what it is that constitutes a princess	38.5789909362793
Why diamondsand she is covered with them	68.46708679199219
To me she seems overloaded observed Eugnie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists	217.1642303466797
See how the artist peeps out exclaimed Madame Danglars	1442.1563720703125
My poor Eugnie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts	36.80902862548828
I admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady	156.5914764404297
What do you think of the count inquired Debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks	94.19487762451172
The count repeated Eugnie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale	36.37543869018555
I quite agree with you said Morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	27.77142333984375
The Countess G insists upon it that he is a vampire	39.84183120727539
Then the Countess G has returned to Paris has she inquired the baroness	61.4844856262207
Is that she mamma asked Eugnie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair	25.40662384033203
Yes said Madame Danglars that is she	329.9208984375
Shall I tell you what you ought to do Morcerf	14.596647262573242
Command me madame	30.379514694213867
Well then you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us	35.28145217895508
What for asked Eugnie	193.11146545410156
What for Why to converse with him of course	45.590049743652344
Have you really no desire to meet him	19.39910888671875
None whatever replied Eugnie	1.0314085483551025
Strange child murmured the baroness	90.08656311035156
He will very probably come of his own accord said Morcerf	15.235156059265137
There do you see madame he recognizes you and bows	76.65361785888672
The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	102.3965835571289
Well said Morcerf I may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes	28.504701614379883
Adieu I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him	18.274015426635742
Go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan	113.86136627197266
But I have never been presented	98.84632873535156
Presented to whom	62.49955749511719
To the beautiful Greek	21.89483070373535
You say she is only a slave	29.463613510131836
While you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess	5.661994934082031
No I hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out	91.94623565673828
That is possiblego	56.72373580932617
I am going said Albert as he made his parting bow	230.8367919921875
Just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and Monte Cristo came forth	7.316483020782471
After giving some directions to Ali who stood in the lobby the count took Alberts arm	185.7158660888672
Carefully closing the box door Ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian	127.4161376953125
Upon my word said Monte Cristo Paris is a strange city and the Parisians a very singular people	539.6273193359375
See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld	80.08641815185547
Now I can promise you that a Frenchman might show himself in public either in Tunis Constantinople Bagdad or Cairo without being treated in that way	44.3494758605957
That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either	93.05358123779297
However as far as Ali is concerned I can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris	12.09676742553711
Really and what has procured me so flattering a distinction	61.84214782714844
What why yourself to be sure You give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of	290.5390930175781
And who has filled your head with all this nonsense	133.50575256347656
Why in the first place I heard it from Madame Danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly I learned it from Beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	165.68507385253906
Why if you sought concealment did you call your horse Vampa	35.92300033569336
That was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera I have been looking for him but without success	85.68194580078125
He will be here tonight	66.097412109375
In what part of the house	24.827146530151367
In the baronesss box I believe	61.39425277709961
That charming young woman with her is her daughter	54.573368072509766
I congratulate you	108.9919662475586
Morcerf smiled	63.106483459472656
We will discuss that subject at length some future time said he	195.484619140625
But what do you think of the music	113.21747589111328
What music	194.95068359375
Why the music you have been listening to	38.22932052612305
Oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late Diogenes	45.82554626464844
From which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise	80.1850814819336
30097 m	147.44143676757812
You are right in some degree when I wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to I go to sleep	35.23672866821289
Then sleep here my dear count	36.87328338623047
The conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for	15.275138854980469
No thank you	58.51602554321289
Your orchestra is too noisy	188.27374267578125
To sleep after the manner I speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation	1074.9368896484375
I knowthe famous hashish	893.8781127929688
So my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me	635.5247802734375
I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said Morcerf	44.46654510498047
Do you mean at Rome	118.18538665771484
I do	205.31207275390625
Ah then I suppose you heard Haydes guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land	67.78070831298828
Morcerf did not pursue the subject and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	283.5017395019531
The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain	88.58487701416016
You will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box	136.40708923339844
What Are you going	85.95136260986328
Pray say everything that is kind to Countess G on the part of her friend the vampire	116.32430267333984
And what message shall I convey to the baroness	113.43849182128906
That with her permission I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening	64.678466796875
The third act had begun and during its progress the Count of Morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars	91.66759490966797
The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	69.45051574707031
The quick eye of Monte Cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	115.32416534423828
Hayde whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear	39.39101028442383
30099 m	72.97391510009766
The third act passed off as usual	110.86370849609375
Mesdemoiselles Noblet Julia and Leroux executed the customary pirouettes Robert duly challenged the Prince of Granada and the royal father of the princess Isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle	79.28181457519531
After which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon	221.88404846191406
The count left his box and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise	52.241939544677734
You are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered	233.3809356689453
I have been most anxious to see you that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express	77.23570251464844
Surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance	86.46285247802734
Believe me madame I had entirely forgotten it	297.3650817871094
But it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend Madame de Villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me	113.78787231445312
30101 m	743.645263671875
This time at least I do not deserve your thanks	21.742345809936523
It was Ali my Nubian slave who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort	25.98763656616211
Was it Ali asked the Count of Morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits	56.4947509765625
No count replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debtif indeed there existed oneand I feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject	98.75431823730469
May I beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter	37.64811325073242
Oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied Madame Danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	41.7536735534668
Eugnie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the Count of Monte Cristo	33.046958923339844
The count bowed while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly	36.61447525024414
You have a charming young person with you tonight count said Eugnie	77.5722427368164
Is she your daughter	80.42578125
No mademoiselle said Monte Cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question	103.3225326538086
She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care	88.21927642822266
And what is her name	32.347408294677734
Hayde replied Monte Cristo	82.94119262695312
A Greek murmured the Count of Morcerf	41.88861846923828
Yes indeed count said Madame Danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume	65.85627746582031
Did I hear rightly monsieur said Monte Cristo that you served at Yanina	81.74424743652344
I was inspectorgeneral of the pashas troops replied Morcerf and it is no secret that I owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief	22.899885177612305
But look exclaimed Madame Danglars	57.68418884277344
Where stammered Morcerf	44.509422302246094
There said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as Hayde whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to Morcerfs face	47.22027587890625
It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Medusa	309.5943298339844
She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat	98.42562103271484
The sound was heard by the people about Ali who instantly opened the boxdoor	131.33450317382812
Why count exclaimed Eugnie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly ill	45.90778350830078
Very probably answered the count	160.1370849609375
But do not be alarmed on her account	56.477943420410156
Haydes nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence	72.29086303710938
However continued Monte Cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket I have an infallible remedy	46.98271942138672
So saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count and left Madame Danglars box	25.473548889160156
Upon his return to Hayde he found her still very pale	47.13191223144531
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold	117.26141357421875
Who was it you were talking with over there she asked	117.6353530883789
With the Count of Morcerf answered Monte Cristo	119.8514404296875
He tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him	75.03985595703125
Wretch exclaimed Hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the Turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery Did not you know that my dear lord	28.27423095703125
Something of this I heard in Epirus said Monte Cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me	23.557172775268555
You shall relate them to me my child	150.48594665527344
They are no doubt both curious and interesting	78.24266815185547
Yes yes but let us go	1.0981953144073486
I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man	72.12332916259766
So saying Hayde arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	58.334720611572266
Do you observe said the Countess G to Albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of Robert le Diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure	23.863069534301758

Some days after this meeting Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his house in the Champslyses which had already assumed that palacelike appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences	66.21397399902344
He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed Baronne Danglars ne Hermine de Servieux	90.77122497558594
Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	96.19277954101562
He was convinced that Luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chausse dAntin	96.12422180175781
In short Madame Danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30000 francs and who went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person	89.7563247680664
But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Luciens visit and the curiosity of the baroness	47.59258270263672
You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf	191.15501403808594
Yes count you know what I told you	33.79499816894531
All remains the same then in that quarter	39.44486618041992
It is more than ever a settled thing said Lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	134.17535400390625
Ah said Monte Cristo I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded	41.745811462402344
Oh things take their course without our assistance	170.48048400878906
While we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end	79.26117706298828
My father and M	51.83319091796875
Danglars served together in Spain my father in the army and M	21.742345809936523
Danglars in the commissariat department	148.36907958984375
It was there that my father ruined by the revolution and M	38.61409378051758
Danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes	88.90924072265625
Yes said Monte Cristo I think M	48.65283203125
Danglars mentioned that in a visit which I paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at Lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album Mademoiselle Eugnie is prettyI think I remember that to be her name	278.6710510253906
Very pretty or rather very beautiful replied Albert but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate I am an ungrateful fellow	97.47306060791016
You speak as if you were already her husband	96.72734069824219
Ah returned Albert in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was doing	25.002199172973633
Really said Monte Cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage	53.39665603637695
Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me replied Morcerf and that frightens me	174.31480407714844
Bah exclaimed Monte Cristo that s a fine reason to give	1675.5028076171875
Are you not rich yourself	80.01988220214844
My fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when I marry	47.35386276245117
That perhaps might not be considered a large sum in Paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society	60.064727783203125
Your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine	218.95628356933594
As for me I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her	81.07918548583984
Albert shook his head and looked thoughtful	64.26274871826172
There is still something else said he	42.93419647216797
I confess observed Monte Cristo that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful	71.49360656738281
Oh said Morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side	68.94175720214844
Whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the marriage	47.95209503173828
It is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union	62.30198287963867
I can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars	20.353757858276367
30107 m	55.017578125
Ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the Comtesse de Morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough	57.27203369140625
I do not know if that is her reason said Albert but one thing I do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	147.05323791503906
There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition	212.0865936279297
Real interrupted the count smiling	108.22720336914062
Oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	42.33634567260742
There is no hurry you know	44.71134948730469
I am not yet twentyone and Eugnie is only seventeen but the two months expire next week	72.66643524169922
It must be done	96.61270141601562
My dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed	69.61363983154297
How happy you are in being exempt from all this	92.87683868408203
Well and why should not you be free too What prevents you from being so	25.80060577392578
Oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not marry Mademoiselle Danglars	85.2685775756836
Marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	60.440406799316406
Yes replied Morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief	88.0759506225586
Then do not marry her said the count	49.326576232910156
Well I shall see	27.78492546081543
I will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position I think rather than give pain to my dear mother I would run the risk of offending the count	1.1951684951782227
Monte Cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	40.43848419189453
Ah said he to Debray who had thrown himself into an easychair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there Are you making a sketch after Poussin	22.946056365966797
Oh no was the tranquil response I am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort	101.53202056884766
I am doing a little sum in arithmetic	46.12562942504883
In arithmetic	31.170989990234375
Yes I am calculatingby the way Morcerf that indirectly concerns youI am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the last rise in Haiti bonds from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206 therefore he must have made 300000 livres	28.516761779785156
That is not his biggest scoop said Morcerf did he not make a million in Spaniards this last year	67.0422592163086
My dear fellow said Lucien here is the Count of Monte Cristo who will say to you as the Italians do	96.3840103149414
Denaro e santit	14.741711616516113
Met della met	1.0814099311828613
When they tell me such things I only shrug my shoulders and say nothing	102.39374542236328
But you were speaking of Haitians said Monte Cristo	45.87635040283203
Ah Haitiansthat is quite another thing Haitians are the cart of French stockjobbing	115.4327163696289
We may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to cartit is not only a game it is a horsduvre M	65.87738037109375
Danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 francs	33.758663177490234
Had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25000	43.43836212158203
And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked Monte Cristo	52.154178619384766
I am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrigues	78.48986053466797
Because said Albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them	181.80093383789062
Ah said the count I see that M	35.481170654296875
Danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he must be enormously rich	86.9386978149414
It is not he who plays exclaimed Lucien it is Madame Danglars she is indeed daring	188.0371551513672
But you who are a reasonable being Lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountainhead surely you ought to prevent it said Morcerf with a smile	57.103050231933594
How can I if her husband fails in controlling her asked Lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases	102.21661376953125
Ah if I were in your place said Albert	65.8314437866211
I would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future soninlaw	124.68010711669922
How would you set about it	52.85486602783203
Ah that would be easy enoughI would give her a lesson	9.41748046875
A lesson	97.31195831298828
Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words	63.833290100097656
Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence	106.44168853759766
I do not understand stammered Lucien	105.16654968261719
It is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheardof piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that Henri IV	89.2744140625
was seen yesterday at Gabrielles	42.73594665527344
That would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette The report circulated by some usually wellinformed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielles house is totally without foundation	182.6522216796875
We can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the PontNeuf	52.27317428588867
Lucien half smiled	98.77687072753906
Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	80.5102767944336
This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	38.074798583984375
The count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered Willingly count I accept	57.537601470947266
The count returned to young Morcerf	134.5803680419922
Do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of M	429.97265625
My dear count said Morcerf I beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely	46.604530334472656
Now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage	56.32268524169922
So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not I think visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life	24.640531539916992
Then said the count I am emboldened to speak openly to you	68.04466247558594
Danglars is my banker M	25.7191104888916
de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him	33.21073532104492
I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs	101.01419830322266
Now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them I have if agreeable to you thought of inviting M	83.01786804199219
and Madame Danglars and M	139.47691345214844
and Madame de Villefort to my countryhouse at Auteuil	45.27632141113281
If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of Morcerf to this dinner I should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	255.33570861816406
In that case your mother would hold me in aversion and I do not at all wish that on the contrary I desire to stand high in her esteem	89.63087463378906
Indeed count said Morcerf I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose	68.9417953491211
You say you desire my mothers good opinion I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent	64.25992584228516
30111 m	85.22504425048828
Do you think so said Monte Cristo with interest	48.884544372558594
Oh I am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day	526.6168823242188
But to return to what we were saying	12.337090492248535
If my mother could know of this attention on your partand I will venture to tell herI am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry	8.946432113647461
The count laughed	56.13248825073242
Well said he to Morcerf but I think your father will not be the only angry one M	16.144813537597656
and Madame Danglars will think me a very illmannered person	79.7310562133789
They know that I am intimate with youthat you are in fact one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintancesand they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you	71.71749114990234
Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	76.0910873413086
You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid	33.85871124267578
I will do better than that said Albert my mother is wishing to go to the seasidewhat day is fixed for your dinner	13.260092735290527
This is Tuesdaywell tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at Trport	43.650047302246094
Really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease	89.10467529296875
Indeed you give me more credit than I deserve I only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all	25.0738468170166
When shall you send your invitations	164.41717529296875
This very day	36.57600402832031
Well I will immediately call on M	39.182308197021484
Danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow	30.056222915649414
I have not seen you consequently I know nothing of your dinner	52.29795455932617
How foolish you are Have you forgotten that M	14.907695770263672
Debray has just seen you at my house	177.6000213623047
Ah true	167.9274139404297
Fix it this way	97.71910095214844
I have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to Trport	65.69393920898438
Well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow	142.40829467773438
Before tomorrowthat will be a difficult matter to arrange besides I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure	35.586849212646484
Well you can do better	18.84797477722168
You were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable	116.9739761352539
What must I do to attain such sublimity	78.24994659423828
You are today free as aircome and dine with me we shall be a small partyonly yourself my mother and I	48.99265670776367
You have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely	11.189428329467773
She is a remarkable woman and I only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case I assure you there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf	35.67216110229492
As to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary	61.111087799072266
We will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventuresyou shall tell us the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the Opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess	98.9664535522461
We will talk Italian and Spanish	1333.061279296875
Come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you	7.24506139755249
A thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	57.40034484863281
I am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary I have a most important engagement	125.40945434570312
Ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse	57.7833251953125
I require the proof of a preengagement	81.04556274414062
I am not a banker like M	449.8858947753906
Danglars but I am quite as incredulous as he is	128.4769744873047
I am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	84.46240234375
Humph said Morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her	69.76323699951172
Monte Cristo started	77.02705383300781
Oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion	23.080217361450195
Baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	55.36723709106445
I had no previous knowledge of your visit had I	149.70797729492188
Indeed you are such an extraordinary person that I would not answer for it	53.985557556152344
At all events I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner	13.54315185546875
Probably not	50.312049865722656
Well listen Baptistin what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory	13.631919860839844
To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet	47.29939651489258
What then	27.7663631439209
Ah my dear count said Albert	1072.5120849609375
No no I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred	122.94770050048828
I wish my life to be free and open	115.57695007324219
Go on Baptistin	111.93602752685547
Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son	38.074798583984375
You hearMajor Bartolomeo Cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of Italy whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of The Inferno you remember it do you not Then there is his son Andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the Parisian world aided by his fathers millions	25.00789451599121
The major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in Italy he confides him to my care	46.047855377197266
If he proves himself worthy of it I will do what I can to advance his interests	403.8951721191406
You will assist me in the work will you not	40.63782501220703
Most undoubtedly	55.50694274902344
This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then	45.436180114746094
By no means	10.33967399597168
He is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in Italy descendants of very ancient families	38.67912673950195
I have met him several times at Florence Bologna and Lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in Paris	36.40980529785156
The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey	139.08792114257812
This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire when he was on his way to Moscow	105.0290298461914
I shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care I will promise to watch over him I shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then I shall have done my part	61.5605583190918
Certainly I see you are a model Mentor said Albert Goodbye we shall return on Sunday	31.181888580322266
By the way I have received news of Franz	26.202985763549805
Have you Is he still amusing himself in Italy	238.77166748046875
I believe so however he regrets your absence extremely	36.38623046875
He says you were the sun of Rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains	55.89189529418945
His opinion of me is altered for the better then	119.96551513671875
No he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings	88.24880981445312
He is a charming young man said Monte Cristo and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when I met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	80.7453384399414
He is I think the son of General dpinay	316.70819091796875
He is	2247.875732421875
The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815	34.80057907104492
By the Bonapartists	90.6960220336914
Really I like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him	216.20065307617188
Yes he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort	1.097143292427063
30115 m	48.884090423583984
And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars said Albert laughing	71.50131225585938
You smile	82.70731353759766
Why do you do so	50.03083801269531
I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	1533.47021484375
But really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardonable	25.018949508666992
Albert rose	32.294944763183594
Are you going	81.9542236328125
Really that is a good ideatwo hours have I been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if I am going	129.8275604248047
Indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	1.0208476781845093
And your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them	313.9965515136719
Monsieur Baptistin especially I could never get such a man as that	20.244924545288086
My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible	98.88318634033203
Therefore if you part with M	89.65485382080078
Baptistin give me the refusal of him	47.09084701538086
By all means	243.92701721191406
That is not all give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mothers side at least and a baroness in right of her father I will help you in the search	55.94327926635742
Ah ha you will do as much as that will you	42.15666961669922
Well really nothing is certain in this world	86.57948303222656
Oh count what a service you might render me I should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention I could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years	2096.1611328125
Nothing is impossible gravely replied Monte Cristo and taking leave of Albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times	160.5558624267578
Bertuccio appeared	26.007003784179688
Monsieur Bertuccio you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil	79.43067932128906
Bertuccio slightly started	48.85437774658203
I shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	267.6051025390625
It is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so	60.32716369628906
There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old	48.037654876708984
Let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is	119.89511108398438
Bertuccio bowed	48.09196090698242
You will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it I should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition	81.49372863769531
I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency	45.66487503051758
I should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the dinner	183.78553771972656
Really my dear M	126.26811981201172
Bertuccio said the count since you have been in Paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me	76.2342529296875
But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive	3.768282175064087
I do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so	176.10939025878906
Lucullus dines with Lucullus that is quite sufficient	110.65662384033203
Bertuccio bowed and left the room	93.9059829711914
Chapter 55	115.39424133300781
Major Cavalcanti	69.10480499267578
Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Alberts invitation	65.90434265136719
Seven oclock had just struck and M	83.64569854736328
Bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for Auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment	125.45693969726562
The visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe	47.599239349365234
He wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one	367.7937316894531
Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at No	92.38099670410156
30 in the Avenue des Champslyses that the Count of Monte Cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps	314.8885192871094
The small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall	282.34259033203125
Therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival	1.1330002546310425
He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air	221.25521850585938
Ah my dear sir you are most welcome I was expecting you	179.07875061035156
Indeed said the Italian was your excellency then aware of my visit	61.10665512084961
Yes I had been told that I should see you today at seven oclock	1442.76513671875
Then you have received full information concerning my arrival	159.0111846923828
Of course	97.3743896484375
Ah so much the better I feared this little precaution might have been forgotten	144.0568084716797
30119 m	57.8014030456543
What precaution	34.22775650024414
That of informing you beforehand of my coming	129.05270385742188
Oh no it has not	7.5731658935546875
But you are sure you are not mistaken	85.9715347290039
Very sure	40.24357223510742
It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening	17.236207962036133
I will prove it to you beyond a doubt	20.933612823486328
Oh no never mind that said the Italian it is not worth the trouble	45.83011245727539
Yes yes said Monte Cristo	78.37306213378906
His visitor appeared slightly uneasy	14.01651668548584
Let me see said the count are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti	36.118953704833984
Bartolomeo Cavalcanti joyfully replied the Italian yes I am really he	330.50665283203125
Exmajor in the Austrian service	52.48393630981445
Was I a major timidly asked the old soldier	238.6571502685547
Yes said Monte Cristo you were a major that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in Italy	117.85807800292969
Very good said the major I do not demand more you understand	94.09212493896484
Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said Monte Cristo	75.76805877685547
No certainly not	61.67714309692383
You were sent by some other person	66.38032531738281
By the excellent Abb Busoni	80.77676391601562
Exactly so said the delighted major	262.2621154785156
And you have a letter	19.06844711303711
Yes there it is	42.71615219116211
Give it to me then	106.14756774902344
And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and read	25.51140022277832
The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	22.728736877441406
Yes yes I see	46.15874099731445
Major Cavalcanti a worthy patrician of Lucca a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence continued Monte Cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million	28.683185577392578
Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	33.14824295043945
Half a million said he magnificent	29.398405075073242
Half a million is it said the major	73.95073699951172
Yes in so many words and it must be so for the abb knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe	78.91252899169922
Be it half a million then but on my word of honor I had no idea that it was so much	50.68559646606445
Because you are robbed by your steward	229.6815185546875
You must make some reformation in that quarter	87.38011932373047
You have opened my eyes said the Italian gravely I will show the gentlemen the door	211.58123779296875
Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter	36.935787200927734
And who only needs one thing more to make him happy	29.71201515197754
Yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	319.288818359375
Which is to recover a lost and adored son	108.92650604248047
A lost and adored son	43.733612060546875
Stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies	111.65599822998047
At the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven	19.885007858276367
Unhappy father said Monte Cristo	140.8468017578125
The count continued	79.85807037353516
I have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years	127.45738983154297
The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety	99.82215881347656
I have the power of so doing said Monte Cristo	89.33019256591797
The major recovered his selfpossession	78.26483917236328
So then said he the letter was true to the end	92.89592742919922
Did you doubt it my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo	18.0988826751709
No indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the Abb Busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all	75.01838684082031
Ah true said Monte Cristo there is a postscript	146.59710693359375
Yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript	701.0460815429688
In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe me	171.09494018554688
The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	80.87156677246094
Very good said the count	69.7047119140625
He said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	87.32205963134766
Then what asked Monte Cristo	146.21453857421875
Then the postscript	200.5548553466797
Well what of the postscript	161.02960205078125
Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter	207.36643981933594
Certainly the Abb Busoni and myself have a small account open between us	38.841182708740234
I do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which I am still owing him but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference	202.6354522705078
You attached great importance then to this postscript my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti	144.29501342773438
I must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the Abb Busoni I had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me I should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris	11.444162368774414
Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said Monte Cristo	253.36740112304688
Why really I know no one said the major	83.69001770019531
But then you yourself are known to others	46.729766845703125
Yes I am known so that	85.04341888427734
Proceed my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti	209.8229217529297
So that you will remit to me these 48000 francs	59.25462341308594
Certainly at your first request	109.80585479736328
The majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	94.6297607421875
But sit down said Monte Cristo really I do not know what I have been thinking ofI have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour	45.16147994995117
Do nt mention it	48.274871826171875
The major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself	30.00658416748047
Now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or Alicante	153.7451629638672
Alicante if you please it is my favorite wine	60.44115447998047
I have some that is very good	75.02876281738281
You will take a biscuit with it will you not	8.898528099060059
Yes I will take a biscuit as you are so obliging	40.921539306640625
Monte Cristo rang Baptistin appeared	29.65584373474121
The count advanced to meet him	102.7406997680664
Well said he in a low voice	84.7965316772461
The young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	299.27276611328125
Into what room did you take him	74.54186248779297
Into the blue drawingroom according to your excellencys orders	124.93553924560547
That s right now bring the Alicante and some biscuits	47.44502258300781
Baptistin left the room	477.1463928222656
Really said the major I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving you	852.0005493164062
Pray do nt mention such a thing said the count	103.04366302490234
Baptistin reentered with glasses wine and biscuits	108.5869369506836
The count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored liquid	76.2000503540039
The bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face	181.3878936767578
The major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit	87.51730346679688
The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine	26.39375114440918
30123 m	51.62589645385742
So sir you lived at Lucca did you You were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy	37.8702392578125
All said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all	107.76173400878906
And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness	41.64619827270508
Only one thing said the Italian	41.64737319946289
And that one thing your lost child	42.65354537963867
Ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting	22.945781707763672
The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed	143.9235382080078
Let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for I always understood you were a bachelor	124.17123413085938
That was the general opinion sir said the major and I	24.853168487548828
Yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	1.0338218212127686
A youthful indiscretion I suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large	74.4811782836914
The major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an underlook at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity	61.83955383300781
Yes said the major I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye	105.48224639892578
Not on your own account surely replied Monte Cristo for a man is above that sort of thing	177.21942138671875
Oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head	243.9215545654297
But for the sake of the mother said the count	81.17423248291016
Yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit	127.75543212890625
Take some more wine my dear Cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante your emotion has quite overcome you	76.77652740478516
His poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear	112.48826599121094
She belonged to one of the first families in Italy I think did she not	72.2890396118164
She was of a noble family of Fiesole count	141.99562072753906
And her name was	126.79120635986328
Do you desire to know her name	219.73080444335938
Oh said Monte Cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for I already know it	138.14385986328125
The count knows everything said the Italian bowing	43.7100715637207
Oliva Corsinari was it not	30.44337272644043
Oliva Corsinari	29.095577239990234
A marchioness	116.60853576660156
A marchioness	25.68345069885254
And you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family	96.97052764892578
Yes that was the way it ended	403.3624572753906
And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said Monte Cristo	56.674072265625
What papers	72.49173736572266
The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari and the register of your childs birth	12.482766151428223
The register of my childs birth	112.44359588623047
The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiof your son is not his name Andrea	283.0173645019531
I believe so said the major	138.77609252929688
What You believe so	1.2638541460037231
I dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time	39.9983024597168
Well then said Monte Cristo you have all the documents with you	56.771114349365234
Your excellency I regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers I neglected to bring them	125.8930892944336
That is unfortunate returned Monte Cristo	54.60403060913086
Were they then so necessary	65.54634094238281
They were indispensable	66.66943359375
The major passed his hand across his brow	71.05806732177734
Ah perbacco indispensable were they	57.41969680786133
Certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child	79.9986343383789
True said the major there might be doubts raised	276.9681091308594
In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated	15.290008544921875
It would be fatal to his interests	194.87594604492188
It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance	145.5604248046875
O peccato	111.31932067871094
You must know that in France they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in Italy to go to the priest and say We love each other and want you to marry us	59.2897834777832
Marriage is a civil affair in France and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity	93.81619262695312
That is the misfortune You see I have not these necessary papers	22.200864791870117
Fortunately I have them though said Monte Cristo	163.99209594726562
You have them	82.61500549316406
I have them	87.76554107666016
Ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48000 francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them	116.52999877929688
I do not at all wonder at itone can not think of everything but happily the Abb Busoni thought for you	237.37648010253906
He is an excellent person	156.28138732910156
He is extremely prudent and thoughtful	69.78443145751953
He is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you	119.71527099609375
Here they are	83.2925033569336
The major clasped his hands in token of admiration	103.1966323852539
You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del MonteCattini here is the priests certificate	140.53445434570312
Yes indeed there it is truly said the Italian looking on with astonishment	17.972938537597656
And here is Andrea Cavalcantis baptismal register given by the cur of Saravezza	60.94280242919922
All quite correct	347.74102783203125
Take these documents then they do not concern me	36.45030975341797
You will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them	33.932769775390625
I should think so indeed If he were to lose them	11.373861312866211
Well and if he were to lose them said Monte Cristo	144.27581787109375
In that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the cur for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained	125.65570831298828
It would be a difficult matter to arrange said Monte Cristo	79.04388427734375
Almost an impossibility replied the major	5285.26318359375
I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers	28.479921340942383
I regard them as invaluable	49.257850646972656
Now said Monte Cristo as to the mother of the young man	32.18327713012695
As to the mother of the young man repeated the Italian with anxiety	93.8703842163086
As regards the Marchesa Corsinari	47.95359420776367
Really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way	82.45127868652344
No sir replied Monte Cristo besides has she not	87.80644226074219
Yes sir said the major she has	311.69775390625
30127 m	117.24351501464844
Paid the last debt of nature	368.0646057128906
Alas yes returned the Italian	79.1196060180664
I knew that said Monte Cristo she has been dead these ten years	332.1883544921875
And I am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	293.0218811035156
What would you have said Monte Cristo we are all mortal	177.90200805664062
Now you understand my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years	162.64453125
Stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed	186.41180419921875
You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world	72.08457946777344
That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife	101.2461929321289
That will be sufficient	44.31991195678711
You think so	80.38172912597656
Very well then	29.045970916748047
If they should hear of the separation	252.50540161132812
Ah yes what could I say	300.984130859375
That an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family	249.8272247314453
By the Corsinari	46.880348205566406
Had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct	71.23301696777344
That is reasonable since he is an only son	938.02734375
Well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten	70.51732635498047
You have doubtless already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you	319.62774658203125
An agreeable one asked the Italian	55.448612213134766
Ah I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart	81.66488647460938
Hum said the major	196.07528686523438
Someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here	70.55809020996094
That who was here	43.471553802490234
Your childyour sonyour Andrea	97.78570556640625
I did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness	333.7908020019531
Then he is here	132.58294677734375
He is said Monte Cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival	45.356815338134766
Ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation	49.469200134277344
My dear sir said Monte Cristo I understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	1.038142442703247
I will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself	235.01528930664062
I should quite imagine that to be the case said Cavalcanti	94.08503723144531
Well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you	43.43048095703125
You will bring him then You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself	54.91868591308594
No I do not wish to come between a father and son	192.5369873046875
Your interview will be private	101.1355972290039
But do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door	102.2586898803711
He is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself	240.6924591064453
By the way said the major you know I have only the 2000 francs which the Abb Busoni sent me this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses and	118.379638671875
And you want money that is a matter of course my dear M	174.3555450439453
Well here are 8000 francs on account	38.714141845703125
The majors eyes sparkled brilliantly	39.93724060058594
It is 40000 francs which I now owe you said Monte Cristo	28.07289695739746
Does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat	120.63742065429688
For what said the count	191.7765655517578
I thought you might want it to show the Abb Busoni	133.42715454101562
Well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in full	304.0014343261719
Between honest men such excessive precaution is I think quite unnecessary	33.52448654174805
Yes so it is between perfectly upright people	195.52862548828125
One word more said Monte Cristo	77.27991485595703
Say on	74.86865234375
You will permit me to make one remark	35.60718536376953
Certainly pray do so	57.91863250732422
Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress	3.3596832752227783
Indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	670.2110595703125
It may be worn at Via Reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in Paris	51.535675048828125
That s unfortunate	55.94039535522461
Oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave Paris	79.0450210571289
But what shall I wear	61.60108184814453
What you find in your trunks	63.99295425415039
In my trunks I have but one portmanteau	73.11326599121094
I dare say you have nothing else with you	34.70405960083008
What is the use of boring ones self with so many things Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible	37.460533142089844
That is just the caseprecisely so	83.41690826416016
But you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you	152.04551696777344
It has arrived at the Htel des Princes Rue de Richelieu	33.59251403808594
It is there you are to take up your quarters	19.68524932861328
Then in these trunks	101.42401123046875
I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your uniform	95.855224609375
On grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well	65.2966537475586
Do not forget your crosses	115.5723876953125
They still laugh at them in France and yet always wear them for all that	49.662723541259766
Very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count	106.8156509399414
Now said Monte Cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear M	102.6004867553711
Cavalcanti to meet your lost Andrea	26.73734474182129
Saying which Monte Cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count	113.21974182128906
Chapter 56	12.384942054748535
Andrea Cavalcanti	48.21673583984375
The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room which Baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously	87.15989685058594
Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	869.45751953125
He was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him	56.69723129272461
When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the goldheaded cane which he held in his hand	29.823802947998047
On perceiving the count he rose quickly	38.2713737487793
The Count of Monte Cristo I believe said he	30.728168487548828
Yes sir and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti	40.713226318359375
Count Andrea Cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow	374.0986633300781
You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count	54.42177963256836
I did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange	47.86527633666992
The letter signed Sinbad the Sailor is it not	840.3729248046875
Exactly so	39.04753494262695
Now as I have never known any Sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the Thousand and One Nights	100.65291595458984
Well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich Englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is Lord Wilmore	73.79317474365234
Ah indeed Then that explains everything that is extraordinary said Andrea	1596.1845703125
He is then the same Englishman whom I metatahyes indeed	195.84532165527344
Well monsieur I am at your service	56.871395111083984
If what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family	202.6254119873047
Certainly I will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention	45.21352005004883
I am as you have said the Count Andrea Cavalcanti son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence	17.10811424255371
Our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and I myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence	68.160888671875
Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master I have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	40.23210906982422
At length I received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in Paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him	80.81544494628906
Really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said Monte Cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you	143.78436279296875
The count from the moment of first entering the drawingroom had not once lost sight of the expression of the young mans countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves Your father is indeed here and is seeking you young Andrea started and exclaimed My father Is my father here	44.54003143310547
Most undoubtedly replied Monte Cristo your father Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti	51.055999755859375
The expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared	21.559654235839844
Ah yes that is the name certainly	53.91323471069336
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti	128.79432678222656
And you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here	133.023193359375
Yes sir and I can even add that I have only just left his company	58.022369384765625
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem	1.2788386344909668
At length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom	76.83421325683594
Your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of Piedmont with a passport signed for Italy	64.43807983398438
You were in the south of France I think	65.6831283569336
Yes replied Andrea with an embarrassed air I was in the south of France	53.074729919433594
A carriage was to await you at Nice	154.26963806152344
Precisely so and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa from Genoa to Turin from Turin to Chambry from Chambry to PontdeBeauvoisin and from PontdeBeauvoisin to Paris	44.55083465576172
30133 m	66.64896392822266
Indeed Then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place	6832.779296875
But said Andrea if my father had met me I doubt if he would have recognized me I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me	46.631046295166016
Oh the voice of nature said Monte Cristo	36.01291275024414
True interrupted the young man I had not looked upon it in that light	24.955873489379883
Now replied Monte Cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is thishe is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	52.86111831665039
Finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you	91.7875747680664
Sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded I hope no false report	35.23375701904297
As for myself I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore the philanthropist	429.9257507324219
I believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for I did not ask not being inquisitive	66.64762878417969
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting	64.08889770507812
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him	12.27027416229248
He did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	141.10751342773438
I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and I have promised to adhere to his instructions	57.89828109741211
Now sir pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	61.83277130126953
I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youmisfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youI would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure	264.2602233886719
Sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	123.9108657836914
Those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	83.06155395507812
I have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman market	184.56715393066406
Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from M	395.7231140136719
Andrea Cavalcanti	1.0434269905090332
Besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette I suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth	44.06107711791992
Well said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if I were you I would not divulge a word of these adventures	60.775997161865234
Your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself	37.036155700683594
This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you my dear count	381.697265625
You would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural	559.0645141601562
You would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night	1797.7432861328125
You might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark	11.875161170959473
I agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant	107.65306091308594
Nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said Monte Cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	82.88252258300781
You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life	92.76424407958984
Andrea visibly changed countenance	49.48857116699219
I would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said Monte Cristo did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule I should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly	78.3250503540039
However your excellency said Andrea in consideration of Lord Wilmore by whom I was recommended to you	169.9471435546875
Yes certainly interrupted Monte Cristo but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear M	243.52073669433594
Andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	117.52243041992188
Ah said the count watching Andreas countenance I do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca	152.85824584960938
You shall soon see him	38.283145904541016
He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service all that will be pardoned	31.932697296142578
We are not generally very severe with the Austrians	114.83106994628906
In short you will find your father a very presentable person I assure you	41.81029510498047
Ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that I have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects	185.0686798095703
He is a millionairehis income is 500000 francs	53.69353485107422
Then said the young man with anxiety I shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position	52.16598129272461
One of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of 50000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in Paris	87.25516510009766
Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there	77.33951568603516
You can not control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and God disposes	66.59210205078125
Andrea sighed	118.1519775390625
But said he so long as I do remain in Paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me	147.05380249023438
You may	550.768798828125
Shall I receive it from my father asked Andrea with some uneasiness	120.3044662475586
Yes you will receive it from your father personally but Lord Wilmore will be the security for the money	56.24987030029297
He has at the request of your father opened an account of 5000 francs a month at M	183.5125732421875
Danglars which is one of the safest banks in Paris	24.844982147216797
And does my father mean to remain long in Paris asked Andrea	159.81578063964844
Only a few days replied Monte Cristo	46.47847366333008
His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together	128.19424438476562
Ah my dear father exclaimed Andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure	53.389095306396484
Therefore said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his meaningtherefore I will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting	32.234336853027344
Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father	117.74102020263672
I hope you do not doubt it	55.00855255126953
30137 m	133.6891632080078
Go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you	52.536067962646484
Andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	37.2057991027832
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawingroom now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea	61.5469970703125
The young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him	290.0669250488281
Ah my dear father said Andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you	98.07803344726562
How do you do my dear son said the major gravely	119.02778625488281
After so many years of painful separation said Andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again	106.5284652709961
Indeed it is after so long a separation	25.151485443115234
Will you not embrace me sir said Andrea	45.15480422973633
30139 m	190.2555694580078
If you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others shoulder	29.585596084594727
Then we are once more reunited said Andrea	86.35157012939453
Once more replied the major	62.272193908691406
Never more to be separated	27.867582321166992
Why as to thatI think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country	160.1844482421875
The fact is said the young man that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave it	69.48933410644531
As for me you must know I can not possibly live out of Lucca therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can	82.83633422851562
But before you leave France my dear father I hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent	85.74256134033203
Certainly I am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but I had resolved on giving them into your hands and if I had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life	2102.9638671875
Where are these papers then	32.020606994628906
Here they are	239.36627197265625
Andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents	36.64836120605469
When he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent Tuscan	97.57420349121094
Then there is no longer any such thing in Italy as being condemned to the galleys	1.0454856157302856
The major drew himself up to his full height	64.59709930419922
Whywhat do you mean by that question	27.41427230834961
I mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these	22.332489013671875
In France my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years for change of air	119.20915222167969
Will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty	61.83460235595703
My dear M	116.11676788330078
Cavalcanti said Andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father	149.19259643554688
The major was about to speak when Andrea continued in a low voice	79.54009246826172
Nonsense I am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50000 francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent	42.43339920043945
The major looked anxiously around him	1.045438528060913
Make yourself easy we are quite alone said Andrea besides we are conversing in Italian	145.59971618652344
Well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs down	346.1959533691406
Monsieur Cavalcanti said Andrea do you believe in fairy tales	83.09677124023438
I used not to do so but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them	100.718017578125
You have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth The major drew from his pocket a handful of gold	26.166278839111328
Most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive	79.54878234863281
You think then that I may rely on the counts promises	92.75287628173828
Certainly I do	220.0845947265625
You are sure he will keep his word with me	36.32093811035156
To the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	243.6967010498047
I as a tender father	28.569507598876953
And I as a dutiful son as they choose that I shall be descended from you	295.5893249511719
Whom do you mean by they	162.43882751464844
Ma foi I can hardly tell but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not	109.97761535644531
From whom	52.60329818725586
From a certain Abb Busoni	273.8709716796875
Have you any knowledge of him	253.08653259277344
No I have never seen him	267.05377197265625
What did he say in the letter	37.82774353027344
You will promise not to betray me	84134.8046875
Rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same	1422.6109619140625
Then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	110.99388122558594
Andrea read in a low voice	819.2488403320312
You are poor a miserable old age awaits you	127.73380279541016

Signed Abb Busoni	434.5020446777344
It is the same	275.17803955078125
What do you mean said the major	73.92655181884766
I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect	129.0538787841797
From the Abb Busoni	368.2110290527344
From whom then	107.21449279785156
From an Englishman called Lord Wilmore who takes the name of Sinbad the Sailor	152.37277221679688
And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abb Busoni	21.540464401245117
You are mistaken there I am ahead of you	69.59956359863281
You have seen him then	64.6300048828125
Yes once	66.4723129272461
Ah that is just what I can not tell you if I did I should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do	44.024864196777344
And what did the letter contain	84.99160766601562
Read it	75.78092193603516
You are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy	87.98066711425781
Do you wish for a name should you like to be rich and your own master	129.4506072998047
Parbleu said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question	53.149784088134766

Sinbad the Sailor	75.3587417602539
Humph said the major very good	28.01573371887207
You have seen the count you say	186.58619689941406
I have only just left him	27.328027725219727
And has he conformed to all that the letter specified	64.34504699707031
He has	85.67948913574219
Do you understand it	214.0595703125
Not in the least	1094.5977783203125
There is a dupe somewhere	66.1485595703125
At all events it is neither you nor I	20.888402938842773
Certainly not	104.83609771728516
Well then	103.01143646240234
Why it does not much concern us do you think it does	1.0582867860794067
No I agree with you there	55.03151321411133
We must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded	32.785438537597656
Ah you shall see I promise you I will sustain my part to admiration	27.507747650146484
I never once doubted your doing so	87.18829345703125
Monte Cristo chose this moment for reentering the drawingroom	28.81563377380371
On hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each others arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered	450.8836669921875
Well marquis said Monte Cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you	30.712427139282227
Ah your excellency I am overwhelmed with delight	131.93325805664062
And what are your feelings said Monte Cristo turning to the young man	144.10372924804688
As for me my heart is overflowing with happiness	12.872138023376465
Happy father happy son said the count	94.5334243774414
There is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon	42.241451263427734
Ah my dear M	40.39901351928711
Cavalcanti I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends	148.9723663330078
I am at your service sir replied the major	107.31023406982422
Now sir said Monte Cristo addressing Andrea make your confession	958.5787963867188
To whom	66.12210083007812
Tell M	69.95818328857422
Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances	60.98163986206055
Ma foi monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord	193.05162048339844
Do you hear what he says major	91.6806640625
Certainly I do	238.46275329589844
But do you understand	39.855018615722656
I do	175.52305603027344
Your son says he requires money	54.89965057373047
Well what would you have me do said the major	226.9575958251953
You should furnish him with some of course replied Monte Cristo	36.79497528076172
Yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards Andrea and slipping a packet of banknotes into the young mans hand	29.774808883666992
What is this	57.34136199951172
It is from your father	118.36349487304688
From my father	75.50599670410156
Yes did you not tell him just now that you wanted money Well then he deputes me to give you this	66.9571533203125
Am I to consider this as part of my income on account	105.72057342529297
No it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris	1684.2164306640625
Ah how good my dear father is	1448.21923828125
Silence said Monte Cristo he does not wish you to know that it comes from him	1042.698974609375
I fully appreciate his delicacy said Andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket	23.930583953857422
And now gentlemen I wish you goodmorning said Monte Cristo	99.82763671875
And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked Cavalcanti	275.3355407714844
Ah said Andrea when may we hope for that pleasure	203.86521911621094
On Saturday if you willYes	38.96395492553711
Let me seeSaturdayI am to dine at my country house at Auteuil on that day Rue de la Fontaine No	55.36919021606445
Several persons are invited and among others M	89.08981323242188
Danglars your banker	181.25509643554688
I will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money	38.78496551513672
Full dress said the major half aloud	91.8078384399414
Oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross kneebreeches	18.668203353881836
And how shall I be dressed demanded Andrea	78.00321197509766
30145 m	33.84910583496094
Oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat	1.1504234075546265
Go to Blin or Vronique for your clothes	29.492019653320312
Baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address	58.03977584838867
The less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	17.360549926757812
If you mean to buy any horses get them of Devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to Baptiste for it	66.67204284667969
At what hour shall we come asked the young man	345.4346008300781
About halfpast six	95.06085205078125
We will be with you at that time said the major	139.4293670654297
The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	160.95921325683594
Monte Cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	129.51376342773438
There go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related Then after an instant of gloomy reflection Come I will go to see the Morrels said he I think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred	196.53761291503906
30147 m	34.16092300415039
Chapter 57	21.918987274169922
In the Lucern Patch	40.380435943603516
Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding M	57.77349090576172
de Villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	68.35682678222656
This time Maximilian was the first to arrive	120.57968139648438
He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk	34.63926696777344
At length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	126.03315734863281
The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugnie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected	28.031269073486328
That she might not appear to fail in her promise to Maximilian she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	200.4177703857422
The young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted	107.38542938232422
Besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say Have patience You see it is not my fault	37.1085090637207
And Maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girlsone fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar	56.61135482788086
It is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man Valentine did not suffer by the contrast	86.17264556884766
In about half an hour the girls went away and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars visit had at last come to an end	34.49188232421875
In a few minutes Valentine reentered the garden alone	53.895545959472656
For fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian	174.6376190185547
Goodevening Valentine said a wellknown voice	29.93146324157715
Goodevening Maximilian I know I have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay	27.258991241455078
Yes I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars	22.577316284179688
I was not aware that you were so intimate with her	252.23281860351562
Who told you we were intimate Maximilian	1.0059596300125122
No one but you appeared to be so	49.20671844482422
From the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other	139.14511108398438
We were having a confidential conversation returned Valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M	113.55647277832031
de Morcerf and I on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying M	112.12128448486328
Dear Valentine	188.47799682617188
That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugnie as in speaking of the man whom I could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed	72.10936737060547
Ah how good you are to say so Valentine You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars	95.75851440429688
It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek	13.697335243225098
It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light	99.72648620605469
No Valentine I assure you such is not the case	83.3633041381836
I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars I can not understand how any man can really love her	21.04742431640625
The fact is Maximilian that I was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison	93.77562713623047
No but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars	47.150909423828125
I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	108.86050415039062
It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted Valentine	99.07788848876953
You can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other	159.26014709472656
If we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement	31.606956481933594
But return to your question	38.62586212158203
30151 m	67.23902893066406
Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M	67.41656494140625
de Morcerf on account of loving another	244.34727478027344
I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugnie	52.07024002075195
Yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject	61.335968017578125
Ah I see you are smiling	241.10508728027344
If you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security	98.24261474609375
Come what did she say	33.65498733520508
She told me that she loved no one said Valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	40.35203552246094
Ah you see	49.518367767333984
Well what does that prove asked Valentine	480.5663757324219
Nothing replied Maximilian	32.79168701171875
Then why did you smile	2175.083984375
Why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself Valentine	732.095947265625
Do you want me to go away	38.65471649169922
Ah no no	18.852428436279297
But do not let us lose time you are the subject on which I wish to speak	64.19261169433594
True we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together	70.736328125
Ma foi said Maximilian in consternation	65.00462341308594
Yes you are right I am but a poor friend to you	65.7645492553711
What a life I cause you to lead poor Maximilian you who are formed for happiness I bitterly reproach myself I assure you	22.61380386352539
Well what does it signify Valentine so long as I am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips And I have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last	104.38191986083984
Those are kind and cheering words	26.810083389282227
You must hope for us both Maximilian that will make me at least partly happy	101.45071411132812
But why must you leave me so soon	175.78529357910156
I do not know particulars	61.29678726196289
I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended	374.81268310546875
Let them take my fortune I am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	192.07492065429688
You would love me as much if I were poor would you not Maximilian	47.71155548095703
Oh I shall always love you	233.80398559570312
What should I care for either riches or poverty if my Valentine was near me and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage	25.229259490966797
I do not think that is the case	110.74556732177734
However it may be Valentine you must not be alarmed	25.493818283081055
I assure you that as long as I live I shall never love anyone else	70.06202697753906
Do you think to reassure me when you say that Maximilian	553.7505493164062
Pardon me you are right	75.3412094116211
I am a brute	119.3114013671875
But I was going to tell you that I met M	44.855621337890625
de Morcerf the other day	75.44287109375
Monsieur Franz is his friend you know	69.27713012695312
What then	79.72866821289062
Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz announcing his immediate return	25.5822811126709
Valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate	19.216716766357422
Ah heavens if it were that But no the communication would not come through Madame de Villefort	92.45441436767578
Why not	258.6681213378906
BecauseI scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it	71.1995620727539
Is it so Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort	472.8089294433594
Do not be in such a hurry to do that said Valentine with a sad smile	14.358473777770996
If she objects to your marrying M	207.49107360839844
dpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition	90.36625671386719
No Maximilian it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects it is marriage itself	1.0454856157302856
Marriage If she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself	411.5968322753906
You do not understand me Maximilian	46.971317291259766
About a year ago I talked of retiring to a convent	214.35098266601562
Madame de Villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the project	40.361724853515625
You can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and I had almost said by whom he is beloved in return	111.37703704833984
When he learned my resolution I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	58.463844299316406
Ah Maximilian I experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet I exclaimedForgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me I will never leave you	18.448486328125
When I had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word	50.09596252441406
Ah Maximilian I may have much to suffer but I feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all	32.335243225097656
Dear Valentine you are a perfect angel and I am sure I do not know what Isabring right and left among the Bedouinscan have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed Heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels	125.72007751464844
But tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining unmarried	81.02481079101562
Did I not tell you just now that I was rich Maximiliantoo rich I possess nearly 50000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the Marquis and Marquise de SaintMran will leave me as much and M	39.743961334228516
Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir	42.29121398925781
My brother Edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me	72.00944519042969
Now if I had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son	40.337493896484375
Ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious	39.71088790893555
It is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love	98.84798431396484
But could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son	52.288543701171875
How could I make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested	75.3948974609375
Valentine I have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently I have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	35.80607604980469
No human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	93.59358215332031
Valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you	190.94293212890625
Valentine started	32.902164459228516
A friend Maximilian and who is this friend I tremble to give my permission	57.5904426574707
Listen Valentine	39.060577392578125
Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met Nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past	49.19699478149414
Well that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary man	147.78253173828125
Extraordinary did you say	388.4385070800781
You have known him for some time then	55.0904541015625
Scarcely longer than eight or ten days	81.88372039794922
And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days Ah Maximilian I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend	62.94060134887695
Your logic is most powerful Valentine but say what you will I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind	46.72322463989258
I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will	75.56723022460938
He must be a prophet then said Valentine smiling	76.3682861328125
Indeed said Maximilian I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good	35.31483840942383
Ah said Valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man Maximilian he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all I have suffered	99.60867309570312
My poor girl you know him already	39.520748138427734
I know him	27.037641525268555
Yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her son	70.48723602294922
The Count of Monte Cristo	42.935115814208984
The same	2371.84716796875
Ah cried Valentine he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be mine	67.13676452636719
The friend of Madame de Villefort It can not be surely Valentine you are mistaken	4.629002094268799
No indeed I am not for I assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited	244.73977661132812
Courted by my stepmother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by Edward who notwithstanding his fear of the counts large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful presentM	82.87849426269531
de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family	44.48582077026367
If such be the case my dear Valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence	275.7884826660156
He meets Albert de Morcerf in Italyit is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to Madame Danglarsit is that he may give her a royal present your stepmother and her son pass before his doorit is that his Nubian may save them from destruction	41.15071487426758
This man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	55.66796875
I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence	105.70585632324219
His smile is so sweet when he addresses me that I forget it ever can be bitter to others	67.47982788085938
Ah Valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be happy	228.47462463378906
Me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if I accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me	1.6094655990600586
Ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that I was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his lifegiving rays	66.31309509277344
You say he loves you Maximilian how do you know that he does All would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity	12.894065856933594
Ah Valentine I assure you you are mistaken	181.6664581298828
If it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantshe would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that I was unhappy he understood that I could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever	109.78956604003906
Who knows but that in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power It is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	73.41209411621094
Ah forgive me said Valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian I have done wrong for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my heart	273.03594970703125
I do not deny the influence of which you speak or that I have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good	21.543807983398438
Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	204.2479248046875
I will not make a confidant of him	125.99806213378906
Alas said Valentine I see that I have given you pain	166.0819854736328
I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you	49.91963577270508
But indeed I am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	27.50422477722168
Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for you	133.75949096679688
30157 m	481.0556335449219
I own that your question embarrasses me Valentine for I can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service	108.09861755371094
Still as I have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him the source of which I can not explain to you	101.51870727539062
Has the sun done anything for me No he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that I see younothing more	50.411720275878906
Has such and such a perfume done anything for me No its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all I can say when I am asked why I praise it	9.273237228393555
My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	75.62958526611328
A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship	75.9403305053711
In his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts I find a relation to my own	94.01718139648438
You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that ever since I have known this man I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him	55.62805938720703
However I have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning	5.095914840698242
He invited me to dine with him on Saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do	44.7550048828125
Well what have I learned since That your mother and M	44.25779342651367
de Villefort are both coming to this dinner	5177.720703125
I shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	103.16357421875
I believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet M	26.151996612548828
and Madame de Villefort and sometimes I confess I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love	117.53890991210938
My good friend said Valentine I should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this	61.10875701904297
Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting Pray reflect a little	39.829200744628906
My father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation Madame de Villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her	108.86460876464844
No no it is as I have said Maximilianthere is no one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpseno support to cling to but my mother in heaven	82.31755828857422
I see that you are right logically speaking said Maximilian but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today	88.88125610351562
I feel the same as regards yourself	122.1373519897461
said Valentine and I own that if you have no stronger proof to give me	160.15670776367188
I have another replied Maximilian but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first	143.7598114013672
So much the worse said Valentine smiling	106.73454284667969
It is nevertheless conclusive to my mind	33.798606872558594
My ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed	57.175907135009766
Dear Maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety When you are away I no longer pray for myself but for you	293.68603515625
30159 m	551.88525390625
Yes since you have known me said Morrel smiling but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance Valentine	194.7578887939453
You are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd	37.25949478149414
Well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which I rode here	1.2863397598266602
Ah what a beautiful creature cried Valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that I could talk to him and pat him	33.46714782714844
He is as you see a very valuable animal said Maximilian	57.41794204711914
You know that my means are limited and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions	151.56668090820312
Well I went to a horse dealers where I saw this magnificent horse which I have named Mdah	84.49100494384766
I asked the price they told me it was 4500 francs	93.67012023925781
I was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when I mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that I was altogether fascinated with him	149.0485382080078
The same evening some friends of mine visited meM	49.54535675048828
de ChteauRenaud M	118.23995208740234
Debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name	41.37018585205078
They proposed a game of bouillotte	76.76031494140625
I never play for I am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain	115.14909362792969
But I was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which I did	267.0591125488281
Just as they were sitting down to table M	6.1656975746154785
de Monte Cristo arrived	35.40201187133789
He took his seat amongst them they played and I won	67.5518798828125
I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 francs	115.94751739501953
We separated at midnight	94.78592681884766
I could not defer my pleasure so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealers	202.41439819335938
Feverish and excited I rang at the door	33.53666305541992
The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for I rushed at once to the stable	186.89393615722656
Mdah was standing at the rack eating his hay	203.11585998535156
I immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the Champslyses	204.24420166015625
As I rode by the counts house I perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain	285.3878479003906
Now Valentine I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him	178.92945861816406
My dear Maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long	170.0299072265625
A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as ours	297.0101013183594
But they are calling me	41.158660888671875
Do you hear	91.38369750976562
Ah Valentine said Maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that I may have the happiness of kissing it	182.60765075683594
Maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows	56.533935546875
As you will Valentine	103.4926528930664
Shall you be happy if I do what you wish	99.75788116455078
Oh yes	51.02421569824219
Valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening	67.85208129882812
Maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss	48.61672592163086
The little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	46.41642761230469
Chapter 58	152.48165893554688
Noirtier de Villefort	86.7929458618164
We will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine which we have just detailed	27.669668197631836
de Villefort entered his fathers room followed by Madame de Villefort	155.23660278320312
Both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic	251.94241333007812
Noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	155.09181213378906
He was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him	70.36902618408203
Noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	108.162353515625
Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity	37.45330810546875
Noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	131.34170532226562
He commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed	19.624114990234375
In short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marblelike features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	113.83443450927734
Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were Villefort Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken	54.663639068603516
But as Villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter	50.096595764160156
Valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in Noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind	42.08872604370117
To this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	53.20341110229492
Valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of everyday life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body	27.596296310424805
As to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	93.64527893066406
Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin	73.51673126220703
As we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing	450.3381042480469
He therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden sent away Barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while Madame de Villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus	14.281414031982422
I trust you will not be displeased sir that Valentine has not come with us or that I dismissed Barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either	425.8377990722656
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you	112.6339340209961
Noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary Villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	1008.8125
This communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation	66.88864135742188
The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more	44.07594680786133
Sir resumed Villefort we are thinking of marrying Valentine	21.734416961669922
Had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there	18.470800399780273
The marriage will take place in less than three months said Villefort	47.438106536865234
Noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	17.117719650268555
Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added	174.3610382080078
We thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	180.87632751464844
It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happyhis name moreover can not be wholly unknown to you	64.7562026977539
It is M	149.74559020996094
Franz de Quesnel Baron dpinay	12.343398094177246
While his wife was speaking Villefort had narrowly watched the old mans countenance	305.2525329589844
When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz the pupil of M	54.21615982055664
Noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his son	44.6786994934082
The procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between M	243.00442504882812
Noirtier and the elder dpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	244.8640899658203
Sir said he you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance	85.96128845214844
Nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that Valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and Valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you	58.60219192504883
30165 m	25.260295867919922
Noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	122.59527587890625
Villefort quietly opened a window saying It is very warm and the heat affects M	170.62574768066406
He then returned to his place but did not sit down	15.934745788574219
This marriage added Madame de Villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of M	43.05128479003906
dpinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in 1815 that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will	44.435447692871094
That assassination was a mysterious affair said Villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person	21.25142478942871
Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	11.431516647338867
Now continued Villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of God hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peaceoffering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed	74.57595825195312
Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	80.71653747558594
Yes I understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt	95.45784759521484
Villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders	240.840576171875
He then motioned to his wife to take leave	248.818359375
Now sir said Madame de Villefort I must bid you farewell	100.17892456054688
Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time	91.44297790527344
It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven	182.95486450195312
If he wanted Valentine he closed his right eye only and if Barrois the left	116.404541015625
At Madame de Villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	95.88877868652344
Provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said Then shall I send Valentine to you The old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish	47.713748931884766
and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	70.52143096923828
Valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it	41.90637969970703
One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	394.8560791015625
Dear grandpapa cried she what has happened They have vexed you and you are angry	8.839090347290039
The paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent	82.68460083007812
Who has displeased you Is it my father	121.90693664550781
Madame de Villefort	17.02814483642578
Me The former sign was repeated	139.58709716796875
Are you displeased with me cried Valentine in astonishment	147.8177032470703
Noirtier again closed his eyes	82.21505737304688
And what have I done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried Valentine	159.02883911132812
There was no answer and she continued	59.557952880859375
I have not seen you all day	154.64312744140625
Has anyone been speaking to you against me	92.73863220214844
Yes said the old mans look with eagerness	64.62889862060547
Let me think a moment	66.06864929199219
I do assure you grandpapaAhM	26.00505256652832
and Madame de Villefort have just left this room have they not	4.629002094268799
And it was they who told you something which made you angry What was it then May I go and ask them that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you	128.3340606689453
No no said Noirtiers look	456.4905700683594
Ah you frighten me	65.87132263183594
What can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be	76.52590942382812
Ah I know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	844.3489990234375
They have been speaking of my marriagehave they not	114.18644714355469
Yes replied the angry look	400.4519348144531
I understand you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the subject	47.89603805541992
The reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it	48.05226135253906
They did not even acquaint me with their intentions and I only discovered them by chance that is why I have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa	226.3448028564453
Pray forgive me	118.59806060791016
But there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was It is not only your reserve which afflicts me	46.06304931640625
What is it then asked the young girl	123.34888458251953
Perhaps you think I shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that I shall forget you when I am married	110.40579223632812
They told you then that M	2464.4814453125
dpinay consented to our all living together	422.56201171875
Then why are you still vexed and grieved The old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection	118.29561614990234
Yes I understand said Valentine it is because you love me	131.7391815185547
The old man assented	177.7158203125
And you are afraid I shall be unhappy	79.74406433105469
You do not like M	73.52182006835938
Franz The eyes repeated several times No no no	55.055450439453125
Then you are vexed with the engagement	1279.5118408203125
Well listen said Valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck I am vexed too for I do not love M	441.2093811035156
Franz dpinay	81.34172821044922
An expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	65.43376159667969
When I wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid	22.009565353393555
Well continued Valentine the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair	102.17904663085938
Noirtiers breathing came thick and short	135.45660400390625
Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too Ah if you could but help meif we could both together defeat their plan But you are unable to oppose themyou whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself	102.1655502319336
Alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them	18.378286361694336
However this is much and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness	109.9725341796875
At these words there appeared in Noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there You are mistaken I can still do much for you	24.72995948791504
Do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said Valentine	44.426719665527344
Noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted anything	39.45079803466797
What is it you want dear grandpapa said Valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud thenfinding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant Noshe said Come since this plan does not answer I will have recourse to another	99.58544158935547
She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N	207.5319366455078
When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted	600.8810424804688
Ah said Valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter N it is with N that we have to do then	43.58110427856445
Well let me see what can you want that begins with N NaNeNiNo	1.2705340385437012
Yes yes yes said the old mans eye	34.35722732543945
Ah it is No then	117.14908599853516
Valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before Noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns	81.97787475585938
During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state Valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	68.67805480957031
At the word Notary Noirtier made a sign to her to stop	144.427734375
30169 m	2531.640380859375
Notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa The old man again signified that it was a notary he desired	74.36981201171875
You would wish a notary to be sent for then said Valentine	106.86726379394531
Shall my father be informed of your wish	109.79432678222656
Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately	192.45455932617188
Then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa	141.65762329101562
Is that all you want	190.41575622558594
Valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M	29.02910041809082
Noirtiers room	25.583324432373047
Are you satisfied now inquired Valentine	112.01018524169922
I am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that	42.725433349609375
And the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	431.1003723144531
de Villefort entered followed by Barrois	79.61473083496094
What do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic	77.5125961303711
Sir said Valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary	124.5340576171875
At this strange and unexpected demand M	1293.213623046875
de Villefort and his father exchanged looks	100.30770111083984
Yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	86.27345275878906
Do you wish for a notary asked Villefort	150.84315490722656
What to do	218.087158203125
Noirtier made no answer	140.73670959472656
What do you want with a notary again repeated Villefort	468.81378173828125
The invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable	116.24595642089844
Is it to do us some ill turn Do you think it is worth while said Villefort	57.1781120300293
Still said Barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if M	188.30194091796875
Noirtier asks for a notary I suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore I shall go at once and fetch one	146.30686950683594
Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted	32.34043884277344
30171 m	256.58514404296875
Yes I do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request	90.77459716796875
You shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said Villefort but I shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one	198.12203979492188
Never mind that said Barrois I shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless	26.533733367919922
And the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	217.66195678710938
Chapter 59	1.206274390220642
The Will	83.73552703857422
As soon as Barrois had left the room Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things	197.3325958251953
The young girl perfectly understood the look and so did Villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily	57.061893463134766
He took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	40.259525299072266
Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at Valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	58.3280143737793
Threequarters of an hour after Barrois returned bringing the notary with him	117.25151824951172
Sir said Villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by M	22.833938598632812
Noirtier whom you see here	503.2405700683594
All his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning	108.3465805053711
Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately	55.34609603881836
Sir said she I perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times	96.01679992675781
That is quite true said Barrois and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked along	66.97682189941406
Permit me said the notary turning first to Villefort and then to Valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility	171.63612365722656
The first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	56.41250991821289
Now I can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and can not be legally exercised	41.47733688354492
The notary then prepared to retire	229.6554718017578
An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	34.87492370605469
Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary	113.20996856689453
Sir said she the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and I can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as I can myself	156.9794158935547
Will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject	77.3990249633789
In order to render an act valid I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client	71.44889068603516
Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite	60.3543815612793
Well sir by the help of two signs with which I will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties	329.5435485839844
Noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no	168.08242797851562
You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with M	46.11872100830078
Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself	162.0171661376953
You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	55.21181869506836
Noirtier closed his eyes	74.95592498779297
And you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts	97.75489044189453
It was you who sent for me	180.7891387939453
To make your will	112.59333801269531
And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions The old man winked violently	72.6954116821289
Well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject	29.99601173400879
But before the notary could answer Villefort had drawn him aside	226.33628845214844
Sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as M	132.09811401367188
Noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties	124.98797607421875
It is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers	121.88607788085938
You must see that to be an utter impossibility said Villefort	34.588233947753906
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look	100.06014251708984
Sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be	273.4166259765625
I can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject	63.11262512207031
I have now been six years with M	200.93536376953125
Noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand	256.4986572265625
No signed the old man	40.20595169067383
Let us try what we can do then said the notary	176.81130981445312
You accept this young lady as your interpreter M	150.3144073486328
Well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up	85.11392974853516
Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W	59.23146057128906
At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop	33.58552169799805
It is very evident that it is the letter W which M	84.4161376953125
Noirtier wants said the notary	108.99425506591797
Wait said Valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated WaWeWi The old man stopped her at the last syllable	48.747127532958984
Valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	208.64114379882812
She passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word Will M	12.713419914245605
Noirtiers eye bade her stop	201.7711639404297
Will said the notary it is very evident that M	37.56214904785156
Noirtier is desirous of making his will	300.5799255371094
Yes yes yes motioned the invalid	36.61137390136719
Really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to M	69.91099548339844
de Villefort	281.3499450683594
Yes said the procureur and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for I can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of Valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and illdefined wishes of her grandfather	402.9842834472656
No no no replied the eye of the paralytic	174.9823760986328
What said Villefort do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will	145.67381286621094
Sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses	73.67999267578125
As to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	284.6504211425781
There are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same	114.81360626220703
As to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	217.50341796875
But besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament	72.18319702148438
Are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	29.257099151611328
30175 m	529.1357421875
Yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning	243.8331756591797
What is he going to do thought Villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were	22.708450317382812
He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but Barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	54.63950729370117
The procureur then told his wife to come up	183.6304931640625
In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also arrived	243.0974884033203
A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	44.908470153808594
They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him	210.21047973632812
When an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person	72.52786254882812
Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune	30.951698303222656
I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions	83.65682983398438
There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	112.97614288330078
Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	663.2771606445312
They had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded	37.98513412475586
Your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked he	72.34034729003906
Noirtier made a sign that it did	31.33961296081543
Do you possess 400000 francs inquired the notary	144.7902374267578
Noirtiers eye remained immovable	54.279991149902344
500000 The same expression continued	65.1759262084961
Noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed sum	414.4841613769531
You are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the notary	94.65652465820312
In landed property	39.06364822387695
In stock	21.383806228637695
The stock is in your own hands	119.2067642211914
The look which M	22.708450317382812
Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find	89.67798614501953
The old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	171.30899047851562
Do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary	480.9341125488281
Noirtier gave his assent	41.17277526855469
They opened it and found 900000 francs in bank scrip	58.29231262207031
The first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	43.6014518737793
The total amount was found to be as M	5.868782043457031
Noirtier had stated	15401.6083984375
It is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor	379.8737487792969
Then turning towards the paralytic he said You possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres	3.5880346298217773
To whom do you desire to leave this fortune	9.44405460357666
Oh said Madame de Villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	173.6279296875
Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter Mademoiselle de Villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection I had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion	256.91607666015625
The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain	110.91800689697266
Is it then to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these 900000 francs demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene	2536.88134765625
Valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying	32.246253967285156
The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent	20.663808822631836
What said the notary do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee	32.440711975097656
You are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention	1.0150865316390991
No repeated Noirtier No	60.05986022949219
Valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment	408.2249755859375
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act	333.6894226074219
But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed	514.439697265625
Oh grandpapa I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed	84.35232543945312
Ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake	452.4332275390625
Thank you thank you murmured she	15.290008544921875
The old mans declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said	553.7505493164062
Then doubtless dear M	2377.080322265625
Noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson Edward de Villefort	208.1507568359375
The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred	138.5970916748047
No said the notary then perhaps it is to your son M	147.28538513183594
de Villefort	223.01744079589844
The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator	64.56661987304688
Villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	812.4866943359375
What have we all done then dear grandpapa said Valentine you no longer seem to love any of us	222.36416625976562
The old mans eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness	54.197021484375
Well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	24.005887985229492
You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune besides they say I am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich even	23.627870559692383
Explain yourself then	35.46969985961914
Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentines hand	164.95086669921875
My hand said she	130.04794311523438
Her hand exclaimed everyone	99.09484100341797
Oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said Villefort	129.6322021484375
Ah cried Valentine suddenly I understand	521.557861328125
It is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa	164.3319854736328
Yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning	172.56649780273438
30179 m	98.11929321289062
You are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not	50.17705154418945
Really this is too absurd said Villefort	148.73309326171875
Excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of M	35.67464828491211
Noirtier is quite evident to me and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind	243.99716186523438
You do not wish me to marry M	1001.1475219726562
Franz dpinay observed Valentine	270.6100769042969
I do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather	66.7630615234375
And you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes	60.819942474365234
So that but for this marriage she would have been your heir	111.36461639404297
There was a profound silence	132.3197021484375
The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair	503.4820556640625
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance	165.08218383789062
But said Villefort who was the first to break the silence I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question	327.3240966796875
I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand	131.38687133789062
It is my wish that she should marry M	214.15113830566406
Franz dpinayand she shall marry him	165.5492401123047
Valentine sank weeping into a chair	93.86962890625
Sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M	42.39849853515625
Franz The old man gave no answer	66.70323944091797
You will of course dispose of it in some way or other	72.89795684814453
In favor of some member of your family	32.81114196777344
Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary	560.7098388671875
But said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony	159.77418518066406
You only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son Noirtier made no answer	206.93252563476562
Do you still wish to dispose of all	33.11145782470703
But they will contest the will after your death	126.55232238769531
My father knows me replied Villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position I can not plead against the poor	123.65445709228516
The eye of Noirtier beamed with triumph	123.8466567993164
What do you decide on sir asked the notary of Villefort	36.062103271484375
Nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his mind	105.50276947021484
I am quite resigned	93.52787017822266
These 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and I shall therefore act according to my conscience	277.2668762207031
Having said this Villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased	193.97731018066406
The same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to M	190.88821411132812
Deschamps the family notary	168.12570190429688
Chapter 60	89.72636413574219
The Telegraph	181.74468994140625
and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	281.70745849609375
Madame de Villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon	140.40591430664062
Although M	26.331031799316406
de Villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air	49.84247589111328
Ma foi said Monte Cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you M	153.2989044189453
de Villefort Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime	50.6704216003418
Villefort tried to smile	46.743289947509766
No count he replied I am the only victim in this case	2994.295166015625
It is I who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me	71.10809326171875
To what do you refer said Monte Cristo with wellfeigned interest	121.00041961669922
Have you really met with some great misfortune	40.93909454345703
Oh no monsieur said Villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which I have sustainednothing worth mentioning I assure you	43.04318618774414
True said Monte Cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit	51.57823181152344
It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said Villefort though after all 900000 francs are worth regretting but I am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood	39.38449478149414
30183 m	43.54145812988281
What do you say said the count 900000 francs It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher	178.81039428710938
And who is the cause of all this annoyance	33.516273498535156
My father as I told you	37.178768157958984
Noirtier But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed	26.064414978027344
Yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner I have described	33.34921646118164
I left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries	103.83556365966797
But to do this he must have spoken	61.90679168701172
He has done better than thathe has made himself understood	84.91751861572266
How was such a thing possible	116.89669799804688
By the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury	89.88720703125
My dear said Madame de Villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil	109.97111511230469
Goodmorning madame said the count bowing	80.9075927734375
Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles	74.80292510986328
What is this that M	152.39028930664062
de Villefort has been telling me demanded Monte Cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune	108.87997436523438
Incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	72.68275451660156
It is an old mans caprice	130.97689819335938
And is there no means of making him revoke his decision	37.29176712036133
Yes said Madame de Villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of Valentine to be altered in her favor	85.29997253417969
The count who perceived that M	94.20278930664062
and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds waterglass	139.34848022460938
My dear said Villefort in answer to his wife you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod	54.345176696777344
Nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many years	56.19973373413086
The Baron dpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged	434.0069580078125
Do you think said Madame de Villefort that Valentine is in league with him She has always been opposed to this marriage and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them	57.73493576049805
Madame said Villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily renounced	74.30685424804688
She could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent	50.64011001586914
Never mind replied Villefort I say that this marriage shall be consummated	23.298397064208984
Notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said Madame de Villefort selecting a new point of attack	71.68692016601562
That is a serious thing	200.05093383789062
Monte Cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said	69.90985870361328
30185 m	71.12260437011719
Madame replied Villefort I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	168.76466369628906
The name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey	221.87559509277344
But under the present circumstances I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	47.960933685302734
It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices	223.57229614257812
I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M	107.32405090332031
Noirtier I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but I shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	30.079607009887695
Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz dpinay because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because I choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever I please	46.87263488769531
What said the count the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this speech	44.65532302856445
What Do you say that M	1.1026650667190552
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry M	18.271636962890625
le Baron Franz dpinay	93.15177917480469
Yes sir that is the reason said Villefort shrugging his shoulders	119.00689697265625
The apparent reason at least said Madame de Villefort	56.13087844848633
The real reason madame I can assure you I know my father	66.51048278808594
But I want to know in what way M	21.122459411621094
dpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person	53.272727966308594
I believe I know M	42.37090301513672
Franz dpinay said the count is he not the son of General de Quesnel who was created Baron dpinay by Charles X	22.2545108795166
The same said Villefort	50.146820068359375
Well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas	52.0244140625
He is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M	22.925933837890625
Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said Madame de Villefort	31.086755752563477
But said Monte Cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred	113.97917938232422
Ah ma foi who is to know	88.46908569335938
Perhaps it is some political difference	153.93948364257812
My father and the Baron dpinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending said Villefort	54.50905227661133
Was not your father a Bonapartist asked Monte Cristo I think I remember that you told me something of that kind	56.59048843383789
My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else said Villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which Napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	23.426530838012695
When my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the Bourbons for M	274.2872314453125
Noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result	99.28630828857422
Well said Monte Cristo it is just as I thought it was politics which brought Noirtier and M	15.378771781921387
dpinay into personal contact	60.180145263671875
Although General dpinay served under Napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor	333.8765869140625
Villefort looked at the count almost with terror	82.4785385131836
Am I mistaken then said Monte Cristo	163.10780334472656
No sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said Madame de Villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M	20.29197120666504
de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies	54.05723190307617
It was a sublime and charitable thought said Monte Cristo and the whole world should applaud it	1.0318773984909058
It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dpinay	33.925148010253906
Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered	125.38504791259766
But the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	135.5855255126953
Although said Villefort it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune I do not think that M	21.949146270751953
dpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	23.68523406982422
He will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him	37.8289794921875
Besides he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of M	34.018585205078125
and Madame de SaintMran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly	84.55435943603516
And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M	103.06145477294922
Noirtier said Madame de Villefort besides they are to come to Paris in about a month and Valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M	51.08015441894531
The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated ambition	323.7693176269531
But it seems to me said Monte Cristo and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say that if M	59.15102005004883
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward	389.817138671875
True said Madame de Villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust Poor Edward is as much M	180.06259155273438
Noirtiers grandchild as Valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry M	83.52301788330078
Franz M	42.138057708740234
Noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he	144.3135223388672
The count listened and said no more	184.28036499023438
Count said Villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes	131.55355834960938
It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and feeling	91.58951568603516
dpinay to whom I had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if I endure the most cruel privations	24.871671676635742
However said Madame de Villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to M	20.955034255981445
dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villefort	31.765193939208984
Ah that would be a great pity said Villefort	13840.1337890625
A great pity said Monte Cristo	46.07809829711914
Undoubtedly said Villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which I was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground	26.519794464111328
No it will all go well M	483.8085632324219
dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible	189.3269500732422
I agree with M	44.638545989990234
de Villefort said Monte Cristo fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice I would persuade him since I have been told M	110.78263854980469
dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation	40.265750885009766
I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on M	1.1329305171966553
de Villefort	53.532936096191406
The procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color	1083.9820556640625
Well that is all that I wanted and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo	84.26215362548828
Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans	81.38200378417969
Sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and M	54.165771484375
dpinay even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty	70.69620513916016
At the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	90.82191467285156
Are you going to leave us count said Madame de Villefort	361.4397277832031
I am sorry to say I must do so madame I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday	174.01251220703125
Did you fear that we should forget it	144.1853790283203
You are very good madame but M	161.62232971191406
de Villefort has so many important and urgent occupations	11.205713272094727
My husband has given me his word sir said Madame de Villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain	166.6298828125
And said Villefort is it at your house in the Champslyses that you receive your visitors	8.78897762298584
No said Monte Cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the country	87.72892761230469
In the country	74.54872131347656
Where is it then Near Paris is it not	111.83983612060547
Very near only half a league from the Barriersit is at Auteuil	17.06409454345703
At Auteuil said Villefort true Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken	212.086181640625
And in what part of Auteuil do you reside	113.69198608398438
Rue de la Fontaine	106.6231918334961
Rue de la Fontaine exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone at what number	22.622648239135742
Then cried Villefort was it you who bought M	3708.037109375
de SaintMrans house	4780.09033203125
Did it belong to M	61.98110580444336
de SaintMran demanded Monte Cristo	179.52830505371094
Yes replied Madame de Villefort and would you believe it count	30.911815643310547
Believe what	63.78755569458008
You think this house pretty do you not	148.16065979003906
I think it charming	283.5228271484375
Well my husband would never live in it	280.2201843261719
Indeed returned Monte Cristo that is a prejudice on your part M	30.332494735717773
de Villefort for which I am quite at a loss to account	75.26425170898438
I do not like Auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm	105.78437042236328
But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said Monte Cristo	191.9585418701172
No countI hopeI assure you I shall do my best stammered Villefort	59.9366340637207
Oh said Monte Cristo I allow of no excuse	93.10523986816406
On Saturday at six oclock	30.558794021606445
I shall be expecting you and if you fail to come I shall thinkfor how do I know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it	161.06800842285156
I will come countI will be sure to come said Villefort eagerly	193.25709533691406
Thank you said Monte Cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you	257.4214172363281
You said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said Madame de Villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject	165.3765411376953
Indeed madame said Monte Cristo I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am going	177.15733337402344
Nonsense say on	106.44625854492188
Well then it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours together	50.30876159667969
What is it	47.55940246582031
A telegraph	35.59812927246094
So now I have told my secret	223.3022918701172
A telegraph repeated Madame de Villefort	77.35430908203125
Yes a telegraph	147.7104034423828
I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	185.5384979248047
I began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination	92.12976837158203
Now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues	65.09122467041016
But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his whitebellied blackclawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	221.7650604248047
At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string	117.4378433227539
30191 m	1.0685210227966309
And are you going there	65.76850128173828
I am	17.316801071166992
What telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory	39.54491424560547
Oh no I should find there people who would force me to understand things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	94.62263488769531
Ma foi I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellowcreatures	119.12226104736328
I shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where I shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work	140.39694213867188
You are a singular man said Villefort	72.46836853027344
What line would you advise me to study	58.16786193847656
The one that is most in use just at this time	50.80705642700195
The Spanish one you mean I suppose	38.408790588378906
Yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you	73.44164276123047
No said Monte Cristo since as I told you before I do not wish to comprehend it	318.2078857421875
The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from M	75.79302978515625
Duchtel or from M	49.1268424987793
Montalivet transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne mystified by two Greek words tle graphein	130.68812561035156
It is the insect with black claws and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance	13531.072265625
Go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything	47.37939453125
Ma foi you frighten me	75.78604888916016
Which is the nearest way Bayonne	84.27204132080078
Yes the road to Bayonne	44.46028518676758
And afterwards the road to Chtillon	57.594207763671875
By the tower of Montlhry you mean	38.98765182495117
Thank you	79.8868637084961
On Saturday I will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph	47.63057327270508
At the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit	40.60783004760742
Chapter 61	73.30201721191406
How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His Peaches	42.43810272216797
Not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the Count of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrire dEnfer taking the road to Orlans	1094.349365234375
Leaving the village of Linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of Montlhry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name	37.75693893432617
At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers	48.3704948425293
Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	56.951717376708984
The count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wallflowers	98.93257141113281
No one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	85.46726989746094
The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix our modern Rubens	104.69571685791016
This path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty	94.00665283203125
Never had Flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure	89.62006378173828
In fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	107.87576293945312
And yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin	58.90321731567383
There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flowerbeds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinire with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure	75.45226287841797
Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around	53.71063995361328
The man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture	88.98214721679688
Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves	33.00340270996094
He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	78.06267547607422
You are gathering your crop sir said Monte Cristo smiling	45.49990463256836
30193 m	10.23681926727295
Excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap I am not up there I know but I have only just come down	37.56566619873047
Do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left	113.8343734741211
I have ten left said the man for here are eleven and I had twentyone five more than last year	161.62440490722656
But I am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir	135.97581481933594
This is the reason that instead of the sixteen I had last year I have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen	20.85329246520996
Ah I miss three they were here last night sirI am sure they were hereI counted them	60.25960159301758
It must be the son of Mre Simon who has stolen them I saw him strolling about here this morning	366.7803955078125
Ah the young rascalstealing in a gardenhe does not know where that may lead him to	120.20073699951172
Certainly it is wrong said Monte Cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent	119.62779998779297
Of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant	120.47248840332031
But sir once more I beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining here	62.52558135986328
And he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	125.06410217285156
30197 m	38.33724594116211
Calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling I am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time	116.6851806640625
Ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile	3.0082876682281494
Still it belongs to government and I ought not to waste it but having received the signal that I might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sundial for there was everything in the enclosure of Montlhry even a sundial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerbytheby sir do you think dormice eat them	362.7996826171875
Indeed I should think not replied Monte Cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the Romans did	21.072650909423828
What Did the Romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice	80.55062866210938
I have read so in Petronius said the count	116.35709381103516
Really They ca nt be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse	351.3346252441406
It is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night	39.23143768310547
Last year I had four apricotsthey stole one I had one nectarine only onewell sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarineI never ate a better	140.497802734375
You ate it	11.891057968139648
That is to say the half that was leftyou understand it was exquisite sir	68.23370361328125
Ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like Mre Simons son who has not chosen the worst strawberries	399.8167724609375
But this year continued the horticulturist Ill take care it shall not happen even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe	35.47160339355469
Monte Cristo had seen enough	248.92230224609375
Every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture	79.21855163574219
He began gathering the grapeleaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener	62.689029693603516
Did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said	1.10649573802948
Yes if it is nt contrary to the rules	3.2221617698669434
Oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying	43.02561950683594
I have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat	161.6437530517578
That is true sir and that is what I like best said the man smiling	20.568382263183594
Why do you like that best	227.30418395996094
Because then I have no responsibility	165.01852416992188
I am a machine then and nothing else and so long as I work nothing more is required of me	72.91996002197266
Is it possible said Monte Cristo to himself that I can have met with a man that has no ambition That would spoil my plans	71.9885025024414
Sir said the gardener glancing at the sundial the ten minutes are almost up I must return to my post	54.713680267333984
Will you go up with me	8.414362907409668
I follow you	136.0236053466797
Monte Cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	58.982845306396484
The tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the furniture	424.63397216796875
The second was the mans conventional abode or rather sleepingplace it contained a few poor articles of household furniturea bed a table two chairs a stone pitcherand some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes	56.13813400268555
Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked Monte Cristo	937.160888671875
The study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious	14.184961318969727
And what is the pay	21.098617553710938
A thousand francs sir	73.26322937011719
It is nothing	112.66197204589844
No but then we are lodged as you perceive	240.7311553955078
Monte Cristo looked at the room	8.898528099060059
They passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	147.25975036621094
Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	162.72962951660156
It is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime	70.33191680908203
At first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year I became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays	40.88302993774414
When we have a fog	417.89654541015625
Ah to be sure	82.7245101928711
Those are indeed holidays to me I go into the garden I plant I prune I trim I kill the insects all day long	28.675247192382812
How long have you been here	196.51193237304688
Ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen	15.568364143371582
You are	82.43119812011719
Fiftyfive years old	29.649608612060547
How long must you have served to claim the pension	279.66796875
Oh sir twentyfive years	758.8603515625
And how much is the pension	98.20003509521484
A hundred crowns	25.228471755981445
Poor humanity murmured Monte Cristo	129.28485107421875
What did you say sir asked the man	158.4505615234375
I was saying it was very interesting	81.53333282470703
What was	198.15350341796875
All you were showing me	260.8446044921875
And you really understand none of these signals	16967.57421875
None at all	83.0843276977539
And have you never tried to understand them	70.2170181274414
Why should I	249.94436645507812
But still there are some signals only addressed to you	91.5933609008789
And do you understand them	62.02992248535156
They are always the same	25.16865348815918
And they mean	85.0774917602539
Nothing new You have an hour or Tomorrow	10.577306747436523
This is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion	56.740074157714844
Ah yes thank you sir	44.67182922363281
And what is it sayinganything you understand	64.4019546508789
Yes it asks if I am ready	54.155120849609375
And you reply	23.718780517578125
By the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that I am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his turn	47.125160217285156
It is very ingenious said the count	4.216803550720215
You will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak	216.3018035888672
I have then five minutes said Monte Cristo to himself it is more time than I require	71.0848388671875
My dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question	289.13507080078125
What is it sir	102.10169982910156
You are fond of gardening	48.75407791137695
And you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres	67.81607818603516
Sir I should make a terrestrial paradise of it	64.29474639892578
You live badly on your thousand francs	4249.0234375
Badly enough but yet I do live	1943.8035888671875
Yes but you have a wretchedly small garden	55.04302978515625
True the garden is not large	73.32963562011719
And then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything	120.43562316894531
Ah they are my scourges	68.16043090820312
Tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing	117.62776947021484
I should not see him	48.79475784301758
Then what would happen	92.19213104248047
I could not repeat the signals	69.74068450927734
And then	71.75761413574219
Not having repeated them through negligence I should be fined	21.328155517578125
How much	126.10234069824219
A hundred francs	71.98369598388672
The tenth of your incomethat would be fine work	27.035842895507812
Ah said the man	74.96917724609375
Has it ever happened to you said Monte Cristo	33.81381607055664
Once sir when I was grafting a rosetree	89.50526428222656
Well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another	37.68061828613281
Ah that is another case I should be turned off and lose my pension	120.15552520751953
Three hundred francs	223.21310424804688
A hundred crowns yes sir so you see that I am not likely to do any of these things	61.613006591796875
Not even for fifteen years wages Come it is worth thinking about	79.58258056640625
For fifteen thousand francs	138.48828125
Sir you alarm me	9.41748046875
Sir you are tempting me	68.35539245605469
Just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand	57.45735168457031
Sir let me see my righthand correspondent	1725.5604248046875
On the contrary do not look at him but at this	94.98377990722656
What is it	31.96672248840332
What Do you not know these bits of paper	53.54752731323242
Exactly there are fifteen of them	47.4681396484375
And whose are they	55.556724548339844
Yours if you like	22.365495681762695
Mine exclaimed the man halfsuffocated	61.12466812133789
Yes yoursyour own property	261.4755859375
Sir my righthand correspondent is signalling	26.79720687866211
Let him signal	155.91293334960938
Sir you have distracted me I shall be fined	1.038155198097229
That will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my banknotes	40.28237533569336
Sir my righthand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient	138.31292724609375
Never mindtake these and the count placed the packet in the mans hands	338.7032165527344
Now this is not all he said you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs	187.8282470703125
I shall still have my place	314.25030517578125
No you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message	25.85238265991211
Oh sir what are you proposing	101.41279602050781
A jest	163.8445281982422
Sir unless you force me	87.76587677001953
I think I can effectually force you and Monte Cristo drew another packet from his pocket	649.7088623046875
Here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twentyfive thousand	188.08763122558594
With five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year	190.66952514648438
A garden with two acres of land	131.74490356445312
And a thousand francs a year	1962.0302734375
Oh heavens	254.65419006347656
Come take them and Monte Cristo forced the banknotes into his hand	98.16641998291016
What am I to do	675.995361328125
Nothing very difficult	19.824512481689453
But what is it	15.027756690979004
To repeat these signs	9.41748046875
Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked	95.98072814941406
There you see it will not take long	107.28082275390625
Yes but	33.89242935180664
Do this and you will have nectarines and all the rest	130.11178588867188
The shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the righthand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad	391.3185729980469
As to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior	129.99685668945312
Now you are rich said Monte Cristo	1.0045534372329712
Yes replied the man but at what a price	124.81817626953125
Listen friend said Monte Cristo	124.8277587890625
I do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when I swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind	38.804222106933594
The man looked at the banknotes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the waterjug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	81.30299377441406
Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister Debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to Danglars house	104.15227508544922
Has your husband any Spanish bonds he asked of the baroness	100.99974822998047
I think so indeed He has six millions worth	39.21441650390625
He must sell them at whatever price	90.12661743164062
Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges and has returned to Spain	297.2333984375
30203 m	293.96319580078125
How do you know Debray shrugged his shoulders	279.57904052734375
The idea of asking how I hear the news he said	101.3887710571289
The baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	97.80133056640625
When it was seen that Danglars sold the Spanish funds fell directly	47.79364013671875
Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares	21.943510055541992
The same evening the following was read in Le Messager	169.39215087890625
By telegraph	87.38011932373047
The king Don Carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at Bourges and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian frontier	27.039613723754883
Barcelona has risen in his favor	33.21950149536133
All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow	97.57801055908203
Those who had kept their shares or bought those of Danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night	185.43746948242188
Next morning Le Moniteur contained the following	120.14572143554688
It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona	127.15520477294922
The king Don Carlos has not left Bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace	4.839130878448486
A telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error	96.9511947631836
The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	1.042302131652832
This reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to Danglars	176.0010986328125
Good said Monte Cristo to Morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been the victim I have just made a discovery for twentyfive thousand francs for which I would have paid a hundred thousand	4487.68359375
What have you discovered asked Morrel	25.917041778564453
I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches	118.91847229003906
Chapter 62	40.21672821044922
At first sight the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside	106.01361846923828
The splendor was within	516.7349243164062
Indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	144.4530792236328
Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed	1502.25634765625
It is told that the Duc dAntin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis XIV	66.85640716552734
in three days M	94.95841979980469
Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual pavingstones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening	133.09933471679688
For the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the pavingstones	67.52566528320312
Thus the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	43.542724609375
The overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	103.03958892822266
Bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with flowers	83.0959701538086
What above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	376.5277404785156
When the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls	319.0468444824219
The servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coachhouses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	162.31271362304688
The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	11.169233322143555
On the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiardtable which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth	160.1334228515625
One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio	127.55290985107422
Before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and Bertuccio with terror	96.32703399658203
At five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at Auteuil followed by Ali	138.18714904785156
Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	484.3191223144531
Monte Cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit	90.46382141113281
That can only be to hold gloves he said	247.2733154296875
Will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted Bertuccio and you will find gloves in it	57.20211410522461
Elsewhere the count found everything he requiredsmellingbottles cigars knickknacks	182.39138793945312
30207 m	45.21903610229492
Good he said and M	75.48400115966797
Bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him	160.8330841064453
At precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of Spahis who had arrived on Mdah	50.26075744628906
I am sure I am the first cried Morrel I did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came	36.47972869873047
Julie and Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you	1.074090600013733
Ah really this is magnificent But tell me count will your people take care of my horse	117.45133972167969
Do not alarm yourself my dear Maximilianthey understand	101.1424560546875
I mean because he wants petting	160.9508514404297
If you had seen at what a pace he camelike the wind	79.02285766601562
I should think soa horse that cost 5000 francs said Monte Cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son	20.543779373168945
Do you regret them asked Morrel with his open laugh	89.55611419677734
I Certainly not replied the count	173.3632049560547
No I should only regret if the horse had not proved good	234.0533905029297
It is so good that I have distanced M	67.1585693359375
de ChteauRenaud one of the best riders in France and M	269.634765625
Debray who both mount the ministers Arabians and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars who always go at six leagues an hour	46.81172561645508
Then they follow you asked Monte Cristo	194.82400512695312
See they are here	336.2581787109375
And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	69.61891174316406
The carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen	90.59807586669922
The instant Debray had touched the ground he was at the carriagedoor	137.719970703125
He offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo	275.6990661621094
But nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministers secretary	100.46643829345703
After his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage	93.6301498413086
Madame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Monte Cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to Morrel	32.06016159057617
Sir if you were a friend of mine I should ask you if you would sell your horse	240.05027770996094
Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to Monte Cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	82.21003723144531
The count understood him	526.7027587890625
Ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me	1944.0733642578125
With you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it	296.0863037109375
If it were so with M	62.25880432128906
Unfortunately replied the count I am witness that M	267.2923889160156
Morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it	64.17189025878906
How so	96.92637634277344
He laid a wager he would tame Mdah in the space of six months	73.05799102783203
You understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of Spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world	39.87754440307617
You see my position madame said Morrel bestowing a grateful smile on Monte Cristo	44.374046325683594
It seems to me said Danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough	17.053674697875977
Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	355.4602966308594
Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce	324.05194091796875
The baroness was astonished	155.0722198486328
Why said she you could plant one of the chestnuttrees in the Tuileries inside How can such enormous jars have been manufactured	210.21348571777344
Ah madame replied Monte Cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question	148.944580078125
It is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water	30.231294631958008
How soat what period can that have been	209.4342803955078
I do not know I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked	76.775390625
Two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea	41.63993453979492
The sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea	42.38786697387695
At the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	13.759278297424316
Divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	197.19406127929688
I am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies	265.0602111816406
Meanwhile Danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	71.77609252929688
When he had finished with the orangetree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orangetree pricked him dreadfully	70.57962799072266
He shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream	87.78508758544922
Sir said Monte Cristo to him I do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by Hobbema a Paul Potter a Mieris two by Gerard Douw a Raphael a Van Dyck a Zurbaran and two or three by Murillo worth looking at	82.32674407958984
Stay said Debray I recognize this Hobbema	94.90360260009766
Ah indeed	26.019798278808594
Yes it was proposed for the Museum	129.06809997558594
Which I believe does not contain one said Monte Cristo	113.36695098876953
No and yet they refused to buy it	5581.87060546875
Why said ChteauRenaud	1012.7381591796875
You pretend not to knowbecause government was not rich enough	70.25711059570312
Ah pardon me said ChteauRenaud I have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and I can not understand them yet	232.48770141601562
You will by and by said Debray	146.63458251953125
I think not replied ChteauRenaud	107.21356964111328
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti announced Baptistin	59.32513427734375
A black satin stock fresh from the makers hands gray moustaches a bold eye a majors uniform ornamented with three medals and five crossesin fact the thorough bearing of an old soldiersuch was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted	66.9627456665039
Close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	216.45492553710938
The three young people were talking together	60.41122055053711
On the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	31.588220596313477
Cavalcanti said Debray	60.640377044677734
A fine name said Morrel	28.99013900756836
Yes said ChteauRenaud these Italians are well named and badly dressed	38.856388092041016
You are fastidious ChteauRenaud replied Debray those clothes are well cut and quite new	79.31641387939453
That is just what I find fault with	84.290283203125
That gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life	59.608638763427734
Who are those gentlemen asked Danglars of Monte Cristo	10.037507057189941
You heardCavalcanti	39.59773635864258
That tells me their name and nothing else	43.025054931640625
Ah true	112.91856384277344
You do not know the Italian nobility the Cavalcanti are all descended from princes	31.067106246948242
Have they any fortune	32.347408294677734
An enormous one	36.011539459228516
What do they do	341.3351135253906
Try to spend it all	81.22716522216797
They have some business with you I think from what they told me the day before yesterday	81.8451919555664
I indeed invited them here today on your account	142.5715789794922
I will introduce you to them	76.91063690185547
But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent said Danglars	277.6780700683594
The son has been educated in a college in the south I believe near Marseilles	230.05255126953125
You will find him quite enthusiastic	124.18407440185547
Upon what subject asked Madame Danglars	96.63896179199219
The French ladies madame	88.94502258300781
He has made up his mind to take a wife from Paris	53.99504852294922
A fine idea that of his said Danglars shrugging his shoulders	215.62850952148438
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself	303.5729675292969
The baron appears thoughtful today said Monte Cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry	272.6997375488281
Not yet I think	216.62982177734375
More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse and has lost money	42.50815963745117
and Madame de Villefort cried Baptistin	1.2649694681167603
They entered	47.464664459228516
de Villefort notwithstanding his selfcontrol was visibly affected and when Monte Cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble	139.6305694580078
Certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said Monte Cristo to himself glancing at Madame Danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	340.58221435546875
After a short time the count saw Bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room	58.11643600463867
He went to him	64.99545288085938
What do you want M	44.4580192565918
Bertuccio said he	59.46339797973633
Your excellency has not stated the number of guests	328.12872314453125
Ah true	39.847957611083984
How many covers	48.85942077636719
Count for yourself	45.039306640625
Is everyone here your excellency	867.217041015625
Bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	32.73622512817383
The count watched him	334.6539611816406
Good heavens he exclaimed	84.11337280273438
What is the matter said the count	110.88987731933594
That womanthat woman	190.69715881347656
The one with a white dress and so many diamondsthe fair one	156.09840393066406
Madame Danglars	27.33027458190918
I do not know her name but it is she sir it is she	1.052131175994873
Whom do you mean	136.59434509277344
The woman of the gardenshe that was enceinteshe who was walking while she waited for	68.54930877685547
Bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end	63.18838882446289
Waiting for whom Bertuccio without answering pointed to Villefort with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo	83.5478744506836
Oh oh he at length muttered do you see	187.62103271484375
What Who	36.483699798583984
de Villefort the kings attorney Certainly I see him	197.06039428710938
Then I did not kill him	115.06121826171875
Really I think you are going mad good Bertuccio said the count	2.9005866050720215
Then he is not dead	31.454927444458008
30213 m	44.31082534790039
No you see plainly he is not dead	92.03685760498047
Instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meit was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy	139.34117126464844
You went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmarethats all	142.94044494628906
Come calm yourself and reckon them upM	97.03750610351562
and Madame de Villefort two M	21.551801681518555
and Madame Danglars four M	63.23781967163086
de ChteauRenaud M	35.4550895690918
Debray M	16.532821655273438
Morrel seven Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti eight	14.369962692260742
Eight repeated Bertuccio	63.20206832885742
Stop You are in a shocking hurry to be offyou forget one of my guests	96.66582489013672
Lean a little to the left	62.91386413574219
Stay look at M	184.3969268798828
Andrea Cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at Murillos Madonna now he is turning	84.14495086669922
This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from Monte Cristo silenced him	139.03521728515625
Benedetto he muttered fatality	86.97062683105469
Halfpast six oclock has just struck M	83.50310516357422
Bertuccio said the count severely I ordered dinner at that hour and I do not like to wait and he returned to his guests while Bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the diningroom	27.982036590576172
Five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawingroom were thrown open and Bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort The dinner waits	225.89810180664062
The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort	154.9818115234375
de Villefort he said will you conduct the Baroness Danglars	128.5601806640625
Villefort complied and they passed on to the diningroom	75.59898376464844
Chapter 63	55.50712966918945
The Dinner	19.485200881958008
It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the diningroom	348.5114440917969
Each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent	224.95228576660156
The recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum	81.07675170898438
And all present even including Cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man	49.473289489746094
Madame Danglars had started when Villefort on the counts invitation offered his arm and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own	463.639892578125
None of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer	241.4192657470703
de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars on his left Morrel	7.053044319152832
The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars the other seats were filled by Debray who was placed between the two Cavalcanti and by ChteauRenaud seated between Madame de Villefort and Morrel	10.689953804016113
The repast was magnificent Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the Parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests	74.75054168701172
It was an Oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare	284.0252380371094
Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan	9.895791053771973
Rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the Archipelago Asia Minor or the Cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draughtall these like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like Cleopatra or drinking refined gold like Lorenzo de Medici	134.37326049804688
Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	29.984582901000977
Gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted	120.78022003173828
Now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellousthat which we do not understand	69.25615692138672
What is it that we really desirethat which we can not obtain	170.2036590576172
Now to see things which I can not understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life	125.825927734375
I gratify my wishes by two meansmy will and my money	88.77202606201172
I take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do M	101.94898986816406
Danglars in promoting a new railway line you M	46.489707946777344
de Villefort in condemning a culprit to death you M	67.42691802978516
Debray in pacifying a kingdom you M	215.0097198486328
de ChteauRenaud in pleasing a woman and you Morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride	81.45864868164062
For example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond St	77.06060028076172
Petersburg the other five leagues from Naples	179.2251739501953
Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table	154.04684448242188
What are the two fish asked Danglars	156.54400634765625
ChteauRenaud who has lived in Russia will tell you the name of one and Major Cavalcanti who is an Italian will tell you the name of the other	209.32156372070312
This one is I think a sterlet said ChteauRenaud	240.39414978027344
And that one if I mistake not a lamprey	199.61843872070312
Just so	17.729154586791992
Now M	198.55453491210938
Danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught	24.239938735961914
Sterlets said ChteauRenaud are only found in the Volga	50.591548919677734
And said Cavalcanti I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size	240.23611450195312
Exactly one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fusaro	75.30608367919922
Impossible cried all the guests simultaneously	488.5174865722656
Well this is just what amuses me said Monte Cristo	23.615249633789062
I am like Nerocupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment	20.822683334350586
This fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is	74.60466003417969
But how could you have these fish brought to France	1.0454856157302856
Oh nothing more easy	141.31845092773438
Each fish was brought over in a caskone filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine	58.84028244018555
You do not believe me M	49.19597244262695
I can not help doubting answered Danglars with his stupid smile	73.8769302368164
Baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive	63.810951232910156
Danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their hands	31.96672248840332
Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	195.22389221191406
But why have two of each sort asked Danglars	71.29509735107422
Merely because one might have died carelessly answered Monte Cristo	72.69686126708984
You are certainly an extraordinary man said Danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich	217.19198608398438
And to have ideas added Madame Danglars	170.51625061035156
Oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the Romans who much esteemed them and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from Ostia to Rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish	31.302669525146484
It was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen	150.64578247070312
Their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead	28.479921340942383
Yes said Debray but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome	54.02953338623047
True said Monte Cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus if we can do no better than he could	19.674232482910156
The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	51.08015441894531
All this is very extraordinary said ChteauRenaud still what I admire the most I confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed	47.94300842285156
Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago	91.12388610839844
Certainly not longer	49.05763626098633
Well I am sure it is quite transformed since last week	31.96672248840332
If I remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old	97.7715835571289
Why not I am fond of grass and shade said Monte Cristo	79.8089599609375
Yes said Madame de Villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road I remember	44.47891616821289
Yes madame said Monte Cristo but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate	21.742345809936523
In four days said Morrel it is extraordinary	31.501018524169922
Indeed said ChteauRenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too	5.889016151428223
I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when M	99.63959503173828
de SaintMran advertised it for sale two or three years ago	28.65297508239746
de SaintMran said Madame de Villefort then this house belonged to M	95.2554702758789
de SaintMran before you bought it	83.08650207519531
It appears so replied Monte Cristo	57.410499572753906
Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it	40.105445861816406
Quite so my steward transacts all this business for me	52.91415023803711
It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said ChteauRenaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the court	21.742345809936523
Really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed	26.59389305114746
Villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off	173.06800842285156
Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said	64.79456329345703
It is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time I came here it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands	480.2033386230469
Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary	528.6497802734375
It is probable stammered out Villefort trying to smile but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding	72.74940490722656
This house is part of Valentines marriageportion and M	49.59716796875
de SaintMran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin	71.71595001220703
It was Morrels turn to become pale	32.347408294677734
There was above all one room continued Monte Cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which I know not why appeared to me quite dramatic	15.64882755279541
Why so said Danglars why dramatic	96.37890625
Can we account for instinct said Monte Cristo	74.70813751220703
Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we can not tell	20.568382263183594
It is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and place	55.298980712890625
And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona	62.524269104003906
Stay since we have finished dinner I will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden	20.6547794342041
After dinner the play	73.8780288696289
Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	87.43638610839844
Madame de Villefort rose Monte Cristo did the same and the rest followed their example	43.43935775756836
Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	8.162075996398926
Did you hear said Madame Danglars	1.4725311994552612
We must go replied Villefort offering his arm	97.54605865478516
The others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which Monte Cristo had created a palace	36.64830780029297
Each one went out by the open doors	77.31820678710938
Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	47.43360137939453
They began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	1649.5926513671875
The drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from China of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture	26.57394790649414
At length they arrived at the famous room	268.556640625
There was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated	67.94068908691406
These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	68.37798309326172
cried Madame de Villefort it is really frightful	232.91278076171875
Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	58.97862243652344
Many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room	31.539342880249023
30221 m	96.23957061767578
Is it not so asked Monte Cristo	40.193504333496094
Look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy bloodcolored drapery And those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes We have seen	96.34587097167969
Villefort became livid Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney	69.01773834228516
Oh said Madame de Villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed	70.64906311035156
Madame Danglars rose suddenly	442.2445983886719
And then said Monte Cristo this is not all	189.690673828125
What is there more said Debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Danglars	67.90748596191406
Ah what else is there said Danglars for at present I can not say that I have seen anything extraordinary	75.20187377929688
What do you say M	94.90373992919922
Ah said he we have at Pisa Ugolinos tower at Ferrara Tassos prison at Rimini the room of Francesca and Paolo	36.114463806152344
Yes but you have not this little staircase said Monte Cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery	185.9075927734375
Look at it and tell me what you think of it	19.464454650878906
What a wickedlooking crooked staircase said ChteauRenaud with a smile	280.14593505859375
I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said Debray	64.20706176757812
Ever since Valentines dowry had been mentioned Morrel had been silent and sad	283.41644287109375
Can you imagine said Monte Cristo some Othello or Abb de Ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from God	46.33287048339844
Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	91.14765167236328
Ah madame cried Debray what is the matter with you how pale you look	1.0305595397949219
It is very evident what is the matter with her said Madame de Villefort M	30.397663116455078
de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death	29.565914154052734
Yes said Villefort really count you frighten the ladies	168.92149353027344
What is the matter asked Debray in a whisper of Madame Danglars	109.97693634033203
Nothing she replied with a violent effort	143.46849060058594
I want air that is all	27.95465850830078
Will you come into the garden said Debray advancing towards the back staircase	339.0585632324219
No no she answered I would rather remain here	53.227848052978516
Are you really frightened madame said Monte Cristo	180.1020965576172
Oh no sir said Madame Danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality	378.3481750488281
30223 m	107.5631103515625
Ah yes said Monte Cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination	242.0436553955078
Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother And this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess Lucina And that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child	112.17005920410156
Here Madame Danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	81.86833190917969
Madame Danglars is ill said Villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage	17.383512496948242
Oh mon Dieu said Monte Cristo and I have forgotten my smellingbottle	78.82351684570312
I have mine said Madame de Villefort and she passed over to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on Edward	80.74002075195312
Ah said Monte Cristo taking it from her hand	79.49114227294922
Yes she said at your advice I have made the trial	542.9491577148438
And have you succeeded	431.8336181640625
I think so	169.77601623535156
Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to consciousness	58.905860900878906
Ah she cried what a frightful dream	118.00885009765625
Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream	93.7781753540039
They looked for M	277.17462158203125
Danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence	41.65637969970703
Monte Cristo seemed in despair	295.71392822265625
He took the arm of Madame Danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti	40.03761291503906
Really madame he said did I alarm you much	197.19406127929688
Oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds	925.0950317382812
Villefort forced a laugh	501.2461242675781
And then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient	382.49273681640625
Well said Monte Cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house	87.00733947753906
Take care said Madame de Villefort the kings attorney is here	115.22774505615234
Ah replied Monte Cristo since that is the case I will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration	156.24085998535156
Your declaration said Villefort	72.07475280761719
Yes before witnesses	136.05844116210938
Oh this is very interesting said Debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it	345.79290771484375
There has been a crime said Monte Cristo	86.3681640625
Come this way gentlemen come M	79.83888244628906
Villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities	87.86628723144531
He then took Villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of Madame Danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thickest	95.57672882080078
All the other guests followed	328.82635498046875
Stay said Monte Cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the ironwork of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant	175.4763641357422
30225 m	96.09554290771484
Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen while that of Villefort trembled	196.48448181152344
A newly born infant repeated Debray this affair becomes serious	431.5186767578125
Well said ChteauRenaud I was not wrong just now then when I said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters	81.9687271118164
This house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime	90.86211395263672
Who said it was a crime asked Villefort with a last effort	49.471195220947266
How is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried Monte Cristo	246.2914276123047
And pray what do you call such an action	47.66474151611328
But who said it was buried alive	61.15776062011719
Why bury it there if it were dead This garden has never been a cemetery	76.23883056640625
What is done to infanticides in this country asked Major Cavalcanti innocently	56.333831787109375
Oh their heads are soon cut off said Danglars	128.97427368164062
Ah indeed said Cavalcanti	72.88360595703125
I think so am I not right M	128.27825927734375
de Villefort asked Monte Cristo	212.07728576660156
Yes count replied Villefort in a voice now scarcely human	116.60186004638672
Monte Cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said	103.54290008544922
Come gentlemensome coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn	63.45097351074219
Indeed count said Madame Danglars I am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that I must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair	54.989830017089844
Monte Cristo bowed and went to Madame de Villefort	313.23077392578125
I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle he said	64.19297790527344
But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars I must speak to you	192.41555786132812
In my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place	134.99305725097656
I will be there	164.39366149902344
At this moment Madame de Villefort approached	196.39175415039062
Thanks my dear friend said Madame Danglars trying to smile it is over now and I am much better	57.309051513671875
Chapter 64	55.36385726928711
The Beggar	130.02915954589844
The evening passed on Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris which Madame Danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced	209.74708557128906
On his wifes request M	132.64682006835938
de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure	87.5063705444336
He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	219.55809020996094
As for M	172.3597412109375
Danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with M	95.75796508789062
Cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	94.75330352783203
While Monte Cristo had begged the smellingbottle of Madame de Villefort he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars	24.715864181518555
Without opposing their arrangements he allowed Morrel ChteauRenaud and Debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in M	97.02625274658203
de Villeforts carriage	75.92650604248047
Danglars more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage	125.21758270263672
Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the English fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray horse	208.14617919921875
Andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	122.53775787353516
Then he had been seized upon by Danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiffnecked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	237.39187622070312
He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available asset	672.14599609375
Then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his 48000 francs and the other 50000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankers servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon	95.44115447998047
One thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalcanti	144.10400390625
The latter faithful to the principle of Horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	269.9563903808594
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more Danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from Switzerland and lobsters sent from England by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro and the sterlet from the Volga	115.04827117919922
Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words	107.41067504882812
Tomorrow sir I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business	319.37255859375
And I sir said Danglars shall be most happy to receive you	85.33182525634766
Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Htel des Princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	96.79566955566406
To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	74.54512786865234
The major seated himself therefore by the side of Danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500000 or 600000 livres	165.18722534179688
As for Andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	1.057731032371521
The groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to Andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step	386.76898193359375
At that moment a hand touched his shoulder	287.58819580078125
The young man turned round thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	97.9087905883789
But instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	58.026771545410156
A red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young mans shoulder and which was the first thing Andrea saw seemed of gigantic size	70.32833862304688
30229 m	135.53744506835938
Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator We can not say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly	71.41602325439453
What do you want of me he asked	145.03463745117188
Pardon me my friend if I disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but I want to speak to you	1.3024322986602783
You have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder	487.80609130859375
I am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew I only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago	107.3362808227539
Come said Andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want Speak quickly friend	58.52914047241211
The man said in a low voice I wishI wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris	103.22174072265625
I am very tired and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you I can scarcely stand	192.2030792236328
The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity	161.82081604003906
Tell me he saidtell me what you want	292.9986877441406
Well then I want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back	79.52204132080078
Andrea turned pale but said nothing	80.79363250732422
Yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth I have taken the whim into my head do you understand Master Benedetto	57.68878173828125
At this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying	241.2665557861328
This man is right I did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late	126.7857666015625
The surprised groom retired	56.23554992675781
Let me at least reach a shady spot said Andrea	186.66824340820312
Oh as for that Ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him	190.00245666503906
Do nt think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because I am tired and also because I have a little business to talk over with you	199.3681640625
Come step in said the young man	165.05023193359375
It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	162.60777282714844
Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though wellpleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle	135.68972778320312
Once out of Auteuil Andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked	107.0842056274414
Now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity	38.043514251708984
Let me ask you why you deceived me	920.2996826171875
How have I deceived you	47.116172790527344
How do you ask When we parted at the Pont du Var you told me you were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany but instead of that you come to Paris	221.28179931640625
How does that annoy you	243.60398864746094
It does not on the contrary I think it will answer my purpose	153.02481079101562
So said Andrea you are speculating upon me	585.4600219726562
What fine words he uses	76.50959014892578
I warn you Master Caderousse that you are mistaken	98.87574005126953
Well well do nt be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous	114.30683898925781
I thought you were earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and I pitied you sincerely as I would a child of my own	84.3053970336914
You know I always did call you my child	22.659929275512695
Come come what then	47.032447814941406
I am patient but go on	127.49800109863281
All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes	139.9288330078125
You must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker	39.081451416015625
So that as you confess you are jealous	113.09774017333984
No I am pleasedso pleased that I wished to congratulate you but as I am not quite properly dressed I chose my opportunity that I might not compromise you	17.053674697875977
Yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed Andrea you speak to me before my servant	48.81489944458008
How can I help that my boy I speak to you when I can catch you	72.24300384521484
You have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if I had missed you tonight I might not have had another chance	113.10760498046875
You see I do not conceal myself	88.24607849121094
You are lucky I wish I could say as much for I do conceal myself and then I was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added Caderousse with his unpleasant smile	57.880863189697266
It was very polite of you	98.24087524414062
Come said Andrea what do you want	358.22052001953125
You do not speak affectionately to me Benedetto my old friend that is not righttake care or I may become troublesome	7338.44140625
This menace smothered the young mans passion	101.68618774414062
He urged the horse again into a trot	101.10652923583984
You should not speak so to an old friend like me Caderousse as you said just now you are a native of Marseilles I am	44.37554931640625
Do you know then now what you are	51.07748031616211
No but I was brought up in Corsica you are old and obstinate I am young and wilful	115.97355651855469
Between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged	41.4806022644043
Is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me	55.61442947387695
Fortune has been kind to you then Your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired Good so much the better said Caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice	97.38204956054688
Oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said Andrea becoming more and more excited	248.27330017089844
If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and wornout shoes on my feet you would not have known me	116.08354187011719
You wrong me my boy now I have found you nothing prevents my being as welldressed as anyone knowing as I do the goodness of your heart	346.34222412109375
If you have two coats you will give me one of them	27.48638153076172
I used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry	1947.3624267578125
True said Andrea	448.07342529296875
What an appetite you used to have Is it as good now	60.075984954833984
Oh yes replied Andrea laughing	64.67119598388672
How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left	743.4804077148438
He is not a prince simply a count	86.54118347167969
A count and a rich one too eh	51.81850051879883
Yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very goodtempered gentleman	50.99673080444336
Oh be easy I have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself	67.90029907226562
But said Caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for ityou understand	86.65998840332031
Well what do you want	1.218824863433838
I think that with a hundred francs a month	83.67002868652344
I could live	46.527931213378906
Upon a hundred francs	11.237479209899902
Comeyou understand me but that with	65.95137023925781
With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy	90.85323333740234
Here are two hundred said Andrea and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of Caderousse	49.07023620605469
30233 m	109.74895477294922
Good said Caderousse	41.51461410522461
Apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum	519.4050903320312
There now again you degrade me	1024.8607177734375
How so	63.96198654174805
By making me apply to the servants when I want to transact business with you alone	143.58505249023438
Well be it so then	40.92646789550781
Take it from me then and so long at least as I receive my income you shall be paid yours	257.3129577636719
Come come I always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you	68.56647491455078
But tell me all about it	89.13025665283203
Why do you wish to know asked Cavalcanti	127.28520965576172
What do you again defy me	98.92276000976562
No the fact is I have found my father	251.15892028808594
What a real father	38.465476989746094
Yes so long as he pays me	1786.21142578125
You ll honor and believe himthats right	147.63075256347656
What is his name	14.319255828857422
Major Cavalcanti	206.98817443847656
Is he pleased with you	35.44509506225586
So far I have appeared to answer his purpose	25.914756774902344
And who found this father for you	23.405160903930664
The Count of Monte Cristo	201.17543029785156
The man whose house you have just left	137.77133178710938
I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the moneychest	40.62242126464844
Well I will mention you to him	384.81072998046875
Meanwhile what are you going to do	60.88534927368164
Yes you	123.292724609375
It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me	366.151123046875
Since you interest yourself in my affairs I think it is now my turn to ask you some questions	133.99977111816406
Ah true	367.7057189941406
Well I shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a caf	21.742345809936523
Then in the evening I shall go to the theatre I shall look like some retired baker	648.9125366210938
That is what I want	191.099609375
Come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better	1774.7913818359375
Do you think so M	86.89331817626953
Bossuet And youwhat will you become A peer of France	5879.314453125
Ah said Andrea who knows	39.38261795043945
Major Cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished	86.68895721435547
No politics Caderousse	331.77301025390625
And now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear	200.3606414794922
Not at all my good friend	1593.886962890625
How Not at all	302.4068908691406
Why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there beforemaking in all about two hundred francswhy I should certainly be arrested at the barriers	12.960968017578125
Then to justify myself I should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the Mediterranean	60.434730529785156
Then I should become simply No	1.0454856157302856
106 and goodbye to my dream of resembling the retired baker No no my boy I prefer remaining honorably in the capital	74.48892211914062
Andrea scowled	29.2760009765625
Certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	4.793801307678223
He drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol	76.59880828857422
But meanwhile Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long Spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	49.09718704223633
The two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another	129.5459442138672
Andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time	51.69617462158203
Good Caderousse he said how happy you will be	141.8516845703125
I will do my best said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard shutting up his knife	103.53352355957031
Well then we will go into Paris	181.42742919921875
But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot	71.12953186035156
Wait said Caderousse we shall see	50.19861602783203
He then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off Cavalcantis hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself	150.31275939941406
But tell me said Andrea am I to remain bareheaded	296.5108642578125
Pooh said Caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off	292.59686279296875
Come come enough of this said Cavalcanti	122.21111297607422
What are you waiting for said Caderousse	6.462138652801514
I hope I am not the cause	149.29627990722656
Hush said Andrea	40.32832717895508
They passed the barrier without accident	76.93367004394531
At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse and Caderousse leaped out	184.30929565429688
Well said Andreamy servants coat and my hat	86.6960678100586
Ah said Caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold	2.0588502883911133
But what am I to do	68.74394226074219
You Oh you are young while I am beginning to get old	332.1481628417969
Au revoir Benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	107.70260620117188
Alas said Andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world	31.3738956451416
Chapter 65	124.45457458496094
A Conjugal Scene	30.12326431274414
At the Place Louis XV	101.37150573730469
the three young people separatedthat is to say Morrel went to the Boulevards ChteauRenaud to the Pont de la Rvolution and Debray to the Quai	226.20863342285156
Most probably Morrel and ChteauRenaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the Chamber in wellturned speeches and in the theatre of the Rue Richelieu in wellwritten pieces but it was not the case with Debray	47.4681396484375
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre he turned to the left galloped across the Carrousel passed through the Rue SaintRoch and issuing from the Rue de la Michodire he arrived at M	132.159912109375
Danglars door just at the same time that Villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg SaintHonor stopped to leave the baroness at her own house	34.66851806640625
Debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments	671.6843872070312
The gate once closed and Debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked	152.91619873046875
What was the matter with you Hermine and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related	137.3294677734375
Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness	24.12589454650879
No Hermine replied Debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the counts	840.3729248046875
Danglars was disagreeable certainly but I know how much you care for his illhumor	978.4425048828125
Someone has vexed you I will allow no one to annoy you	180.6758270263672
You are deceived Lucien I assure you replied Madame Danglars and what I have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which I did not think it worth while to allude to	138.55287170410156
It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as Debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	85.81061553955078
Being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu	5872.71337890625
At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornlie her confidential maid	1248.709228515625
What is my daughter doing asked Madame Danglars	305.8592224121094
She practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied Mademoiselle Cornlie	268.17083740234375
Yet I think I hear her piano	10.656171798706055
It is Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in bed	122.59059143066406
Well said Madame Danglars come and undress me	378.15283203125
They entered the bedroom	180.47760009765625
Debray stretched himself upon a large couch and Madame Danglars passed into her dressingroom with Mademoiselle Cornlie	46.83695602416992
My dear M	78.25856018066406
Lucien said Madame Danglars through the door you are always complaining that Eugnie will not address a word to you	19.89296531677246
Madame said Lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed I am not the only one who makes similar complaints I think I heard Morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed	62.088985443115234
True said Madame Danglars yet I think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study	154.75473022460938
My study	136.76138305664062
At least that of the minister	51.284725189208984
Why so	40.28962326049805
To ask for an engagement at the Opera	31.50459861755371
Really I never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion	260.4545593261719
Debray smiled	261.8623962402344
Well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers	81.45328521728516
Go Cornlie said Madame Danglars I do not require you any longer	68.04803466796875
Cornlie obeyed and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to Debray	1134.4395751953125
Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel	154.3523406982422
Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence	129.02435302734375
Come Hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so	1549.468017578125
30239 m	1032.4625244140625
Nothing answered the baroness	89.96533966064453
And yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a lookingglass	458.6556701660156
I am frightful tonight she said	23.16107940673828
Debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly	420.5628967285156
Danglars appeared Debray reseated himself	861.82958984375
At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal	89.06389617919922
Goodevening madame said the banker goodevening M	88.92894744873047
Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day	140.8218231201172
Assuming a dignified air she turned round to Debray without answering her husband	33.2193603515625
Read me something M	185.51397705078125
Debray she said	156.05665588378906
Debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with gold	47.85346603393555
Excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and M	14.74721622467041
Debray lives some distance from here	109.65327453613281
Debray was petrified not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do	56.96312713623047
The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations	57.59014129638672
The result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	79.32027435302734
Lucien said the baroness I assure you I have no desire to sleep and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me	84.96636199951172
I am at your service madame replied Lucien coldly	19.888992309570312
My dear M	50.42914962768555
Debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but I claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife	124.79769134521484
This time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that Lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	92.6276626586914
Do not think I wish to turn you out my dear Debray continued Danglars oh no not at all	60.46738815307617
An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely I make such a request I am sure you can not grudge it to me	7.858409404754639
Debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like Nathan in Athalie	88.28765869140625
It is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us	21.795862197875977
30241 m	25.786422729492188
Lucien having left Danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as Debray and attempting to bite him Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	66.39178466796875
The animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless	66.59324645996094
Do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving Generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal	109.66070556640625
It is because I am in a worse humor than usual replied Danglars	160.54713439941406
Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain	125.12512969970703
These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars but this evening he took no notice of them	194.6102752685547
And what have I to do with your illhumor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me Keep your illhumor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them	91.28404998779297
Not so replied Danglars your advice is wrong so I shall not follow it	23.50672721862793
My money boxes are my Pactolus as I think M	38.558380126953125
Demoustier says and I will not retard its course or disturb its calm	49.98542404174805
My clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom I pay much below their deserts if I may value them according to what they bring in therefore I shall not get into a passion with them those with whom I will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune	49.1027946472168
And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune Explain yourself more clearly I beg sir	6283.21435546875
Oh make yourself easyI am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what I mean	416.2222900390625
The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the course of an hour	40.0863151550293
I do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face	67.37690734863281
You understand me perfectly on the contrary said Danglars but if you will persist I will tell you that I have just lost 700000 francs upon the Spanish loan	130.2290802001953
And pray asked the baroness am I responsible for this loss	972.5086669921875
Why not	92.99737548828125
Is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs	4207.46240234375
Certainly it is not mine	93.77486419677734
Once for all sir replied the baroness sharply I tell you I will not hear cash named it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband	87.18280029296875
Oh I can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny	83.77906036376953
The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to me	44.84384536743164
I only know one thing I dislike more which is the sound of your voice	119.88168334960938
Really said Danglars	1.1022729873657227
Well this surprises me for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs	50.31602096557617
30243 m	67.43309020996094
I What could put such an idea into your head	40.13174057006836
Ahwhat next	4.629002094268799
Most assuredly	54.52286911010742
I should like to know upon what occasion	86.80055236816406
Oh mon Dieu that is very easily done	30.397634506225586
Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian funds	522.2180786132812
You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made	48.05174255371094
I know how clearsighted your dreams are I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt and I gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to you	54.63822937011719
You spent it as you pleased that was your business	55.16755676269531
In March there was a question about a grant to a railway	10.656171798706055
Three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities	46.896915435791016
You told me that your instinctand although you pretend to know nothing about speculations I think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairswell you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the Southern	25.795425415039062
I bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and I picked up a million from which 250000 francs were paid to you for pinmoney	43.42627716064453
How have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of mine	118.78285217285156
When are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience	77.12960052490234
Patience madame I am coming to it	40.33772277832031
That s fortunate	125.83673095703125
In April you went to dine at the ministers	37.62702178955078
You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairson the expulsion of Don Carlos	477.8460693359375
I bought some Spanish shares	98.21370697021484
The expulsion took place and I pocketed 600000 francs the day Charles V	680.2402954101562
repassed the Bidassoa	34.161598205566406
Of these 600000 francs you took 50000 crowns	59.699947357177734
They were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and I asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500000 livres	1891.603759765625
Well sir and what then	6157.1396484375
Ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything	58.707496643066406
Really your manner of speaking	129.6193389892578
It expresses my meaning and that is all I want	85.45252227783203
Well three days after that you talked politics with M	21.814743041992188
Debray and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain	103.53489685058594
Well I sold my shares the news got out and I no longer soldI gave them away next day I find the news was false and by this false report I have lost 700000 francs	64.51952362060547
Well since I gave you a fourth of my gains I think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 francs	115.66682434082031
What you say is absurd and I can not see why M	105.44679260253906
Debrays name is mixed up in this affair	116.07451629638672
Because if you do not possess the 175000 francs I reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and M	242.6104278564453
Debray is one of your friends	76.73045349121094
30245 m	198.9684295654297
For shame exclaimed the baroness	229.5042724609375
Oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here pocketing the whole of the 500000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discoveredthat is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses	385.1261291503906
The baroness became enraged	46.91459655761719
Wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with	110.2029800415039
I do not say that I did know it and I do not say that I did not know it	149.51649475097656
I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent	52.630043029785156
Some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the Thtre Italien at the same time I felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in London	74.49855041503906
This cost me on your account and mine 100000 francs	112.1421890258789
I said nothing for we must have peace in the house and 100000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much	102.83735656738281
Well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers secretary	57.188175201416016
You understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box	54.50716781616211
But today I find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700000 francs per month	286.8881530761719
Stop there madame for this can not last	34.201358795166016
Either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and I will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame	87.53450775146484
Oh this is too much cried Hermine choking you are worse than despicable	71.19100952148438
But continued Danglars I find you did not even pause there	53.32813262939453
You are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	158.89430236816406
I have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way	64.12784576416016
You say you have nothing to do with my cash box	80.8161392211914
Be it so	138.1816864013672
Do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine	27.944490432739258
Besides how do I know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite has not concerted with M	29.33128547668457
Debray to ruin me	57.63555145263672
A probable thing	54.074493408203125
Why not Who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams	84.54657745361328
It was done on purpose for meI am sure of it	26.548908233642578
Sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty It was a mistake	110.10386657714844
Yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700000 francs	24.010011672973633
But sir said Hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by M	127.94172668457031
Debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it Why to accuse the man do you address the woman	149.590087890625
Do I know M	59.37519836425781
Debraydo I wish to know himdo I wish to know that he gives advicedo I wish to follow itdo I speculate No you do all this not I	111.70328521728516
Still it seems to me that as you profit by it	177.9929656982422
Danglars shrugged his shoulders	153.7495574951172
Foolish creature he exclaimed	185.26231384277344
Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the artfor generally husbands will not seeyou would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world	46.48298263549805
But it has not been so with meI see and always have seen during the last sixteen years	78.89018249511719
You may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me	161.63319396972656
What has been the resultthat thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from M	33.12248611450195
de Villefort to M	36.15864944458008
Debray who has not trembled before me	7.137481212615967
There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the housethe only title I desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as I have spoken of them this day	67.88298797607422
I will allow you to make me hateful but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all I forbid you to ruin me	195.62216186523438
The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculationodious as all his calculations were	60.67332077026367
de VillefortWhat do you mean	15.596904754638672
I mean that M	76.0164566040039
de Nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kings attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six	21.28502655029297
I am brutalI not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business	31.939699172973633
Why did he kill himself instead of you Because he had no cash to save	130.03573608398438
My life belongs to my cash	18.45033073425293
Debray has made me lose 700000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250000 livres and do as all bankrupts dodisappear	57.06039810180664
He is a charming fellow I allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he	49.463443756103516
Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	56.85181427001953
Danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	41.25511169433594
He shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when Madame Danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream	25.140350341796875
Chapter 66	44.38679504394531
Matrimonial Projects	302.6212463378906
The day following this scene at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office his coup did not appear	84.4161376953125
At this time that is about halfpast twelve Madame Danglars ordered her carriage and went out	101.71101379394531
Danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for	179.8872528076172
He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not returned	53.586605072021484
He then called for his horses drove to the Chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget	45.218509674072266
From twelve to two oclock Danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from Major Cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker	325.6663513183594
On leaving the Chamber Danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry reentered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champslyses No	54.73930740356445
Monte Cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawingroom	54.453304290771484
While the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abb and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	39.693336486816406
A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and Monte Cristo appeared	85.85923767089844
Pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the Abb Busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in Paris not having seen him for a long time I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait	40.74462890625
Nay said Danglars it is my fault I have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire	27.21478843688965
Not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you You look careworn really you alarm me	19.230056762695312
Melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world	80.01610565185547
I have been in illluck for several days said Danglars and I have heard nothing but bad news	76.63761138916016
Ah indeed said Monte Cristo	40.26767349243164
Have you had another fall at the Bourse	225.72763061523438
No I am safe for a few days at least	33.978477478027344
I am only annoyed about a bankrupt of Trieste	129.43553161621094
Really Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi	95.83004760742188
Exactly so	38102.625
Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I do nt know how long to the amount of 800000 or 900000 francs during the year	9085.20703125
Never a mistake or delaya fellow who paid like a prince	464.2456359863281
Well I was a million in advance with him and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment	58.67676544189453
It is an unheardof fatality	170.61459350585938
I draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in Paris at the end of this month	129.03111267089844
Today is the 30th	119.90237426757812
I present them but my correspondent has disappeared	72.44194030761719
This with my Spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month	34.608642578125
Then you really lost by that affair in Spain	92.09217071533203
Yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more	96.01437377929688
Why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager	111.48707580566406
Oh it is all my wifes fault	315.7669372558594
She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain she believes in dreams	116.8604736328125
It is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me	186.5186767578125
On this conviction I allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and lost	63.69050979614258
It is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	32.21628952026367
But do you mean to say you have not heard of this Why the thing has made a tremendous noise	57.70798873901367
Yes I heard it spoken of but I did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse	115.9898681640625
30251 m	218.0658416748047
Then you do not speculate	188.2726593017578
IHow could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in regulating my income I should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy	528.5804443359375
But touching these Spanish affairs I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter	14.184961318969727
The papers said something about it did they not	8.476186752319336
Then you believe the papers	11.957723617553711
Inot the least in the world only I fancied that the honest Messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches	63.24846649169922
Well that s what puzzles me replied Danglars the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph	58.90824508666992
So that said Monte Cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this month	81.49998474121094
Not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss	55.22366714477539
Diable said Monte Cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortune	134.7738800048828
Thirdrate said Danglars rather humble what do you mean by that	1.1862788200378418
Certainly continued Monte Cristo I make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate fortunes	21.645662307739258
I call those firstrate which are composed of treasures one possesses under ones hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as France Austria and England provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions I call those secondrate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises jointstock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than 1500000 francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally I call those thirdrate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the dayin fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions	410.9937744140625
I think this is about your position is it not	19.270708084106445
Confound it yes replied Danglars	129.54434204101562
The result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to despair	228.98484802246094
Oh said Danglars becoming very pale how you are running on	180.00155639648438
Let us imagine seven such months continued Monte Cristo in the same tone	59.35142135620117
Tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1700000 francs make nearly twelve millions No you have notwell you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man	11.431516647338867
We have our clothes some more splendid than othersthis is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for thirdrate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it	100.65080261230469
Well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause deathso pay attention to it my dear Monsieur Danglars	32.07999038696289
Do you want money Do you wish me to lend you some	66.94310760498047
30253 m	11.431516647338867
What a bad calculator you are exclaimed Danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation	46.5953483581543
I have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded	25.63735580444336
I have made up the loss of blood by nutrition	29.28072738647461
I lost a battle in Spain I have been defeated in Trieste but my naval army in India will have taken some galleons and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine	22.269542694091797
Very good very good But the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss	177.72801208496094
No for I am only embarked in certainties replied Danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust	248.80435180664062
Well such things have been	53.824371337890625
That there should be a famine	43.961997985839844
Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine	80.58194732666016
Or that the sea should become dry as in the days of Pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans	127.59342193603516
So much the better	1.0454856157302856
I congratulate you my dear M	43.08207702636719
Danglars said Monte Cristo I see I was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate fortunes	1670.97021484375
I think I may aspire to that honor said Danglars with a smile which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	111.71404266357422
But while we are speaking of business Danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what I am to do for M	87.13379669189453
Give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good	214.7078857421875
Excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by Busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course I immediately counted him over the forty banknotes	312.3929138183594
Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent	98.85599517822266
But that is not all continued Danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son	344.1541748046875
May I ask how much he allows the young man	113.56757354736328
Five thousand francs per month	200.65570068359375
Sixty thousand francs per year	20.159088134765625
I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow	60.410701751708984
How can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month	56.01435852050781
But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more	143.0421142578125
Do not advance it the father will never repay it	116.5542221069336
You do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers	62.239479064941406
And by whom were they recommended to you	175.7158203125
Oh by the house of Fenzi one of the best in Florence	62.25779342651367
I do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement	1.5065996646881104
Would you not trust the Cavalcanti	88.39798736572266
I oh I would advance ten millions on his signature	95.70459747314453
I was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just now	93.88797760009766
And with all this how unassuming he is I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major	234.0408935546875
And you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	74.82176208496094
The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	65.07760620117188
But all the Italians are the same they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in Oriental splendor	330.5194396972656
The young man is better said Danglars	41.929786682128906
Yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	63.14004898071289
I was uneasy about him	148.519775390625
Because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	342.7774658203125
He has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris before	28.415672302246094
Ah I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked Danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes	38.57456588745117
It is usual certainly but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people	36.80686950683594
I can not help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a wife	143.93890380859375
Do you think so	50.94188690185547
I am sure of it	78.11901092529297
And you have heard his fortune mentioned	49.312042236328125
Nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing	296.04803466796875
And what is your opinion	51.705589294433594
I ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression	42.67045211791992
Well and it is that	78.26445770263672
My opinion is that all these old podests these ancient condottierifor the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provincesmy opinion I say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them	49.81742477416992
Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land	62.404354095458984
Very little at least I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in Lucca	72.05997467041016
Ah he has a palace said Danglars laughing come that is something	160.9840850830078
Yes and more than that he lets it to the Minister of Finance while he lives in a simple house	73.32564544677734
Oh as I told you before I think the old fellow is very close	36.0831298828125
Come you do not flatter him	108.33805847167969
I scarcely know him I think I have seen him three times in my life all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself	103.87552642822266
He was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in Italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in France or England of multiplying his millions but remember that though I place great confidence in Busoni I am not responsible for this	208.4822235107422
Never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me	136.07168579101562
It is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were	63.332969665527344
By the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune	41.09303665161133
Oh that depends upon circumstances	1.0454856157302856
I know an Italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in Tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month	231.6007537841797
Should Andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions	165.4984130859375
For example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the fatherinlaw of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key doublelocks his coffer and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice	1072.563720703125
Ah that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess he will want a crown an El Dorado and Potos	53.55889129638672
No these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry into plain families like Jupiter they like to cross the race	1.0454856157302856
But do you wish to marry Andrea my dear M	36.24427795410156
Danglars that you are asking so many questions	53.69667053222656
Ma foi said Danglars it would not be a bad speculation I fancy and you know I am a speculator	55.632781982421875
You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars I hope you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert	79.9732666015625
Albert repeated Danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it I think	138.49111938476562
But he is betrothed to your daughter I believe	1.088570237159729
Well M	96.39443969726562
de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage but Madame de Morcerf and Albert	278.3179626464844
You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match	91.98531341552734
Indeed I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M	22.84461784362793
de Morcerf	29.92530632019043
Mademoiselle Danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes	41.88981628417969
Oh I do not mean her fortune only but tell me	14.19273853302002
Why did you not invite M	14.459879875183105
and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner	138.01869201660156
I did so but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air	167.22830200195312
Yes yes said Danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good	51.63515090942383
Why so	522.7647094726562
Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth	25.925445556640625
Monte Cristo took no notice of this illnatured remark	38.99447250366211
But still if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name	30.301801681518555
So he has but I like mine as well	51.160526275634766
Certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years	32.610633850097656
And for this very reason said Danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic I prefer M	128.89447021484375
Andrea Cavalcanti to M	27.166051864624023
Albert de Morcerf	9.195839881896973
Still I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti	52.59238815307617
The MorcerfsStay my dear count said Danglars you are a man of the world are you not	13.908453941345215
I think so	3.810173511505127
And you understand heraldry	150.1629638671875
A little	171.43882751464844
Well look at my coatofarms it is worth more than Morcerfs	97.81779479980469
Why so	91.6897201538086
Because though I am not a baron by birth my real name is at least Danglars	57.48813247680664
Well what then	29.221094131469727
While his name is not Morcerf	454.03338623046875
Hownot Morcerf	104.82305145263672
Not the least in the world	52.2039794921875
Go on	315.8104553222656
I have been made a baron so that I actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all	83.136474609375
Listen my dear count M	30.51523208618164
de Morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years	59.20714569091797
You know I have made the most of my arms though I never forgot my origin	10.340476989746094
A proof of great humility or great pride said Monte Cristo	89.9671401977539
Well when I was a clerk Morcerf was a mere fisherman	13.842080116271973
And then he was called	10.153081893920898
Only Fernand	23.432769775390625
Fernand Mondego	42.89588928222656
You are sure	37.03053283691406
Pardieu I have bought enough fish of him to know his name	31.37722396850586
Then why did you think of giving your daughter to him	54.26909255981445
Because Fernand and Danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me	40.706878662109375
Oh nothing	80.40637969970703
Ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of Fernand Mondego	16.931049346923828
I have heard that name in Greece	53.75815200805664
In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha	46.71333694458008
Exactly so	90.79095458984375
This is the mystery said Danglars	11.29278564453125
I acknowledge I would have given anything to find it out	17.428991317749023
It would be very easy if you much wished it	98.4476318359375
How so	85.30318450927734
Probably you have some correspondent in Greece	150.78347778320312
I should think so	100.88158416748047
At Yanina	86.02037048339844
Well write to your correspondent in Yanina and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepelini	31.96672248840332
You are right exclaimed Danglars rising quickly I will write today	79.19902801513672
Do so	18.381269454956055
I will	508.8498229980469
30259 m	448.05316162109375
And if you should hear of anything very scandalous	172.9269561767578
I will communicate it to you	138.81614685058594
You will oblige me	111.78688049316406
Danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coup	82.63966369628906
Chapter 67	48.069435119628906
The Office of the Kings Attorney	109.54253387451172
Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed and follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion	64.40726470947266
We have said that at halfpast twelve oclock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage	41.85184097290039
She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain went down the Rue Mazarine and stopped at the Passage du PontNeuf	69.2890625
She descended and went through the passage	41.95718765258789
She was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning	27.283056259155273
At the Rue Gungaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay	164.45294189453125
As soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet	35.002891540527344
She then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible	221.81570434570312
The cab crossed the PontNeuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des PasPerdus	99.76139831542969
There was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the Palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	61.88737106323242
There was a great press of people in M	589.417724609375
de Villeforts antechamber but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	20.889352798461914
The instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to M	46.45914077758789
de Villeforts office	203.3352508544922
The magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the doorkeeper pronounce the words Walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the mans footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room	116.96795654296875
Then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said	117.48567962646484
Thanks madamethanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated	62.697425842285156
30261 m	1.078895092010498
It is a long time madame said the procureur describing a halfcircle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to Madame Danglarsit is a long time since I had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and I regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation	97.74314880371094
Nevertheless sir you see I have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you	38.1884651184082
Villefort smiled bitterly	61.9974250793457
It is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companionit is true then that all our actions leave their tracessome sad others brighton our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sandsit leaves its track Alas to many the path is traced by tears	11.635339736938477
Sir said Madame Danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not Spare me then I beseech you	38.755062103271484
When I look at this roomwhence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when I look at that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamedoh it requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge	269.3957214355469
Villefort dropped his head and sighed	163.22537231445312
And I he said I feel that my place is not in the judges seat but on the prisoners bench	76.03004455566406
30263 m	165.66224670410156
You said Madame Danglars	143.7923126220703
Yes I	126.9528579711914
I think sir you exaggerate your situation said Madame Danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment	96.24641418457031
The paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	39.48772430419922
Besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you	166.55068969726562
Madame replied Villefort you know that I am no hypocrite or at least that I never deceive without a reason	17.897798538208008
If my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received	121.60712432861328
I was not so in my youth I was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles	105.71528625488281
But since then everything has changed in and about me I am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	53.40615463256836
It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it	67.7471694946289
Thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it	159.1877899169922
The means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say Why did I not do this instead of that Women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes	248.07815551757812
In any case sir you will allow replied Madame Danglars that even if the fault were alone mine I last night received a severe punishment for it	63.008975982666016
Poor thing said Villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet	52.18635559082031
Well I must tell you	17.91042709350586
Collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all	10.970090866088867
Ah exclaimed Madame Danglars alarmed what is there more to hear	176.58761596679688
You only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough	259.19976806640625
Well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful perhaps sanguinary	106.58206939697266
The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat	938.7351684570312
How has this terrible past been recalled cried Villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame	67.54930877685547
Alas said Hermine doubtless it is chance	373.1138610839844
Chance replied Villefort No no madame there is no such thing as chance	136.2664031982422
Oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this Was it not by chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house Was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the treesthat poor innocent offspring of mine which I never even kissed but for whom I wept many many tears	291.1734619140625
Ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers	39.721946716308594
Well no madamethis is the terrible news I have to tell you said Villefort in a hollow voiceno nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterredno	172.05050659179688
You must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble	184.0306396484375
What can you mean asked Madame Danglars shuddering	282.8963317871094
I mean that M	1.2011313438415527
de Monte Cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there	67.00173950195312
Neither of them there repeated Madame Danglars her staring wideopen eyes expressing her alarm	121.92530822753906
Neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her	64.5048828125
No said Villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no	82.18064880371094
Then you did not bury the poor child there sir Why did you deceive me Where did you place it tell mewhere	4.629002094268799
There But listen to melistenand you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you	75.30831146240234
Oh you frighten me But speak I will listen	96.67062377929688
You recollect that sad night when you were halfexpiring on that bed in the red damask room while I scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery	62.430633544921875
The child was born was given to memotionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead	55.70729446411133
Madame Danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but Villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention	33.517391204833984
We thought it dead he repeated I placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin I descended to the garden I dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	88.08708190917969
Scarcely had I covered it with earth when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me I saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	120.39048767089844
I felt pain I wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice I fell lifeless and fancied myself killed	85.07733154296875
Never shall I forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness I dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me	237.66030883789062
We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	34.31999206542969
You had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	120.7657699584961
A duel was the pretext for my wound	140.3565216064453
Though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone	50.01985549926758
I was taken to Versailles for three months I struggled with death at last as I seemed to cling to life I was ordered to the South	172.31158447265625
Four men carried me from Paris to Chlons walking six leagues a day Madame de Villefort followed the litter in her carriage	33.076839447021484
At Chlons I was put upon the Sane thence I passed on to the Rhne whence I descended merely with the current to Arles at Arles I was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to Marseilles	78.7791748046875
My recovery lasted six months	57.263160705566406
I never heard you mentioned and I did not dare inquire for you	65.98625946044922
When I returned to Paris I learned that you the widow of M	77.58222961425781
de Nargonne had married M	239.1075439453125
What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me Always the samealways the childs corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture	33.40156173706055
I inquired immediately on my return to Paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years	17.047414779663086
I found the tenant	201.75596618652344
I pretended that I disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers	2890.421630859375
I offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6000 francs	88.33545684814453
I would have given 10000I would have given 20000	1.0454856157302856
I had the money with me I made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when I had obtained what I so much wanted I galloped to Auteuil	114.43008422851562
No one had entered the house since I had left it	66.74708557128906
It was five oclock in the afternoon I ascended into the red room and waited for night	38.81389236450195
There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force	204.7440643310547
The Corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from Nmes to Paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the childhe might become acquainted with your personnay he might even then have known it	67.08255767822266
Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger It was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that I should cause all traces of the past to disappearthat I should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection	17.683757781982422
It was for this I had annulled the leaseit was for this I had comeit was for this I was waiting	250.76329040527344
Night arrived I allowed it to become quite dark	851.7808227539062
I was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which I continually expected to see some spy concealed I trembled	37.64311981201172
I seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and I dared not turn around	53.374473571777344
My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would open	274.7938537597656
At length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased	78.06717681884766
I understood that I had nothing to fear that I should neither be seen nor heard so I decided upon descending to the garden	72.84253692626953
Listen Hermine I consider myself as brave as most men but when I drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which I had found in my coatthat little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ringwhen I opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre I leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked	56.577945709228516
I seemed to be going mad	334.16009521484375
At last I mastered my agitation	84.61324310302734
I descended the staircase step by step the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees	120.4111557006836
I grasped the railings if I had relaxed my hold for a moment I should have fallen	66.62230682373047
I reached the lower door	167.62347412109375
Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall I took it and advanced towards the thicket	112.30079650878906
I had provided myself with a dark lantern	98.81414031982422
In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it then I continued my path	29.692852020263672
It was the end of November all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet	60.65107345581055
My terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket that I took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself	314.40228271484375
I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches	169.82742309570312
I examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty	65.45691680908203
I looked carefully around I was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night	136.91217041015625
I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to dig the hole	236.37359619140625
The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it	25.691993713378906
Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there I had turned up the ground	131.32391357421875
I went to work	125.65582275390625
The hour then for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	65.91860961914062
How I worked how I hoped how I struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade But no I found nothing though I had made a hole twice as large as the first	92.62377166748047
I thought I had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	156.5128631591797
I turned around I looked at the trees I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time	3589.24658203125
A cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead	64.59534454345703
I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so I had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a restingplace for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone	58.71990203857422
On my right I saw the tree behind me the rock	158.93673706054688
I stood in the same attitude and threw myself down	47.01639175415039
I rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still I found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there	73.58059692382812
30269 m	91.69583892822266
The chest no longer there murmured Madame Danglars choking with fear	200.1101837158203
Think not I contented myself with this one effort continued Villefort	27.255273818969727
No I searched the whole thicket	26.70037841796875
I thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but I could find nothing	29.825927734375
Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner	62.33847427368164
In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my search	105.42301177978516
I remained in the room and waited	45.31553268432617
Oh Heaven	138.91407775878906
30271 m	167.66217041015625
When daylight dawned I went down again	16.162336349487305
My first visit was to the thicket	44.59479522705078
I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	209.3064727783203
I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet	153.0476531982422
A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour	87.38449096679688
But I could find nothingabsolutely nothing	89.96671295166016
Then I renewed the search	334.0648498535156
Supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me	150.0839385986328
Oh cried Madame Danglars it was enough to drive you mad	114.3759765625
I hoped for a moment that it might said Villefort but that happiness was denied me	46.149112701416016
However recovering my strength and my ideas Why said I should that man have carried away the corpse	24.759296417236328
But you said replied Madame Danglars he would require it as a proof	73.2945327758789
Ah no madame that could not be	54.83502960205078
Dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken	110.48405456542969
Now nothing of the kind has happened	69.87446594238281
What then asked Hermine trembling violently	25.885669708251953
Something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usthe child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it	121.96717834472656
Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing Villeforts hands exclaimed My child was alive said she you buried my child alive You were not certain my child was dead and you buried it Ah	71.34733581542969
Madame Danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp	362.2789611816406
I know not I merely suppose so as I might suppose anything else replied Villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness	128.14859008789062
Ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief	68.75249481201172
Villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt	119.51228332519531
You understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost	242.86599731445312
This child lives and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secret and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret	124.25699615478516
Just God avenging God murmured Madame Danglars	24.817394256591797
Villeforts only answer was a stifled groan	93.4764633178711
But the childthe child sir repeated the agitated mother	34.11330795288086
How I have searched for him replied Villefort wringing his hands how I have called him in my long sleepless nights how I have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them At last one day when for the hundredth time I took up my spade I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child	74.42018127441406
A child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river	93.87096405029297
Impossible cried Madame Danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child	110.94943237304688
Perhaps continued Villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital	46.047855377197266
Oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there	172.55990600585938
I ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the 20th of Septembera child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half	23.402130126953125
This portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter H	290.3453369140625
Truly truly said Madame Danglars all my linen is marked thus Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron and my name is Hermine	28.644350051879883
Thank God my child was not then dead	80.36808776855469
No it was not dead	90.19255828857422
And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy Where is the child	265.7026672363281
Villefort shrugged his shoulders	55.362247467041016
Do I know said he and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer Alas no I know not	89.69911193847656
A woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin	89.09295654296875
This woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her	94.94275665283203
But you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced her	1.0734224319458008
And what do you think I did I feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	148.43502807617188
They traced her to Chlons and there they lost her	15.245038986206055
They lost her	51.503204345703125
Yes forever	46.505130767822266
Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail	51.08015441894531
And this is all said she and you stopped there	186.74159240722656
Oh no said Villefort I never ceased to search and to inquire	530.7385864257812
However the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite	108.64364624023438
But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience	312.8635559082031
But replied Madame Danglars the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does	59.38426208496094
Oh the wickedness of man is very great said Villefort since it surpasses the goodness of God	129.62132263183594
Did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us	523.22607421875
But have you ever watched him carefully	51.22776412963867
Doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing	118.35350799560547
I might have suspected he was poisoning us	96.64080810546875
And you see you would have been deceived	23.536108016967773
Yes doubtless	75.27031707763672
But believe me that man has other projects	31.96672248840332
For that reason I wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him	50.8615608215332
Tell me cried Villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection	42.961944580078125
Never to anyone	104.10798645019531
You understand me replied Villefort affectionately when I say anyonepardon my urgencyto anyone living I mean	237.48709106445312
Yes yes I understand very well ejaculated the baroness never I swear to you	21.004608154296875
Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning Do you keep a journal	174.50558471679688
No my life has been passed in frivolity I wish to forget it myself	208.4752655029297
Do you talk in your sleep	84.4161376953125
30275 m	341.96136474609375
I sleep soundly like a child do you not remember	248.21778869628906
The color mounted to the baronesss face and Villefort turned awfully pale	206.90243530273438
It is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard	22.92234230041504
Well said the baroness	75.1388931274414
Well I understand what I now have to do replied Villefort	106.48052215576172
In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M	141.4201202392578
de Monte Cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden	53.53525924682617
Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him	64.77716827392578
Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	74.35321044921875
Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	31.739076614379883
Chapter 68	28.020084381103516
A Summer Ball	105.60272979736328
The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the Rue du Helder passed through the gateway of No	299.8668518066406
27 and stopped in the yard	3.3596832752227783
In a moment the door was opened and Madame de Morcerf alighted leaning on her sons arm	96.85393524169922
Albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the Champslyses to the house of Monte Cristo	1.0454856157302856
The count received him with his habitual smile	155.9011993408203
It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans favor	169.04244995117188
Those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	96.11345672607422
Morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand	153.03598022460938
Monte Cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	96.93358612060547
Here I am dear count	157.31924438476562
Welcome home again	181.23374938964844
I arrived an hour since	301.8749694824219
From Dieppe	218.5048828125
No from Trport	159.67584228515625
And I have come at once to see you	88.39364624023438
That is extremely kind of you said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference	75.97264099121094
And what is the news	53.70775604248047
You should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news	47.59635925292969
I know it but in asking for news I mean have you done anything for me	156.70994567871094
Had you commissioned me said Monte Cristo feigning uneasiness	231.86859130859375
Come come said Albert do not assume so much indifference	213.53750610351562
It is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at Trport I felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me	108.67872619628906
Possibly said Monte Cristo I have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge	86.70086669921875
30277 m	253.47821044921875
Indeed Pray tell me how it happened	55.451656341552734
Danglars dined with me	62.15077590942383
I know it to avoid meeting him my mother and I left town	158.61314392089844
But he met here M	38.47846984863281
Andrea Cavalcanti	62.20592498779297
Your Italian prince	167.98899841308594
Not so fast M	2492.15673828125
Andrea only calls himself count	52.19267654418945
Calls himself do you say	51.569671630859375
Yes calls himself	109.11614990234375
Is he not a count	67.4388427734375
What can I know of him He calls himself so	152.28713989257812
I of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise	51.487998962402344
What a strange man you are What next You say M	182.21517944335938
Danglars dined here	66.93203735351562
Yes with Count Cavalcanti the marquis his father Madame Danglars M	25.67165756225586
and Madame de Villefortcharming peopleM	169.99351501464844
Debray Maximilian Morrel and M	34.160701751708984
de ChteauRenaud	26.596277236938477
Did they speak of me	169.68479919433594
Not a word	105.12132263183594
So much the worse	67.99455261230469
Why so I thought you wished them to forget you	117.32154083251953
If they did not speak of me I am sure they thought about me and I am in despair	58.000465393066406
How will that affect you since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you Truly she might have thought of you at home	49.55213928222656
I have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which I think of her	37.86568069458008
Touching sympathy So you hate each other said the count	1.0561373233795166
Listen said Morcerfif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families I am ready to agree to the arrangement	42.236671447753906
In a word Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wifediable	76.23516082763672
And this said Monte Cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse	83.40059661865234
Yes it is rather unkind I acknowledge but it is true	135.81866455078125
But as this dream can not be realized since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me	85.20301818847656
One may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens There she must always be and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful	149.45603942871094
You are difficult to please viscount	84.31283569335938
Yes for I often wish for what is impossible	43.96303939819336
What is that	201.5687255859375
To find such a wife as my father found	133.58509826660156
Monte Cristo turned pale and looked at Albert while playing with some magnificent pistols	1.0454856157302856
Your father was fortunate then said he	123.59268951416016
You know my opinion of my mother count look at herstill beautiful witty more charming than ever	122.92172241210938
For any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at Trport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while I return more contented more peacefulshall I say more poeticthan if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my companion	99.65409088134766
30279 m	130.91378784179688
That is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life	142.3413543701172
Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	51.42762756347656
Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it The diamond which glittered in the window at Marls or Fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure	102.08548736572266
Worldling murmured the count	90.6964111328125
Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugnie perceives I am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions	1015.802978515625
Monte Cristo smiled	123.51709747314453
One plan occurred to me continued Albert Franz likes all that is eccentric I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered My eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise	39.64726638793945
That is what I call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself	29.630109786987305
Albert smiled	126.96247863769531
Apropos continued he Franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him I think	44.16106414794922
I said Monte Cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that I did not like M	43.52755355834961
Franz I like everyone	40.952247619628906
And you include me in the expression everyonemany thanks	46.32575988769531
Let us not mistake said Monte Cristo I love everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor as Christians but I thoroughly hate but a few	42.45327377319336
Let us return to M	139.5605926513672
Franz dpinay	106.97071075439453
Did you say he was coming	44.3808708190918
Yes summoned by M	83.96459197998047
de Villefort who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M	415.7296142578125
Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugnie settled	54.955989837646484
It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done	49.5506591796875
But M	42.924339294433594
dpinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently	17.794477462768555
Still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	131.89834594726562
He entertains a very high opinion of M	27.988155364990234
and Madame de Villefort	124.50519561767578
Which they deserve do they not	52.0405158996582
I believe they do	67.33929443359375
de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man	75.62641906738281
There is then one said Monte Cristo whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars	104.42324829101562
Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied Albert laughing	42.0888786315918
Indeed my dear sir said Monte Cristo you are revoltingly foppish	141.198974609375
I foppish how do you mean	14.599223136901855
Yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars	195.404296875
Let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract	90.95704650878906
Bah said Albert staring	62.699432373046875
Doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement	173.51809692382812
I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so	44.589500427246094
Then make yourself quite easy	155.14544677734375
Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end	92.56637573242188
Am I indeed so happy said Albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow	51.05084991455078
But my dear count has M	50.1672248840332
Danglars any reason	345.9253234863281
Ah there is your proud and selfish nature	840.3729248046875
You would expose the selflove of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle	20.651531219482422
But yet M	84.5072021484375
Danglars appeared	40.921539306640625
Delighted with you was he not Well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	46.98957443237305
I know not whom look and judge for yourself	370.305419921875
Thank you I understand	184.12973022460938
But my motherno not my mother I mistakemy father intends giving a ball	118.15191650390625
A ball at this season	89.30094146728516
Summer balls are fashionable	495.115966796875
If they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so	8.999122619628906
You are right You know they are select affairs those who remain in Paris in July must be true Parisians	1945.9691162109375
Will you take charge of our invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti	400.8081970214844
When will it take place	28.987085342407227
On Saturday	40.69921875
Cavalcantis father will be gone	258.98638916015625
But the son will be here will you invite young M	8.43220043182373
I do not know him viscount	86.54906463623047
You do not know him	25.316171646118164
No I never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him	360.5074768066406
But you receive him at your house	75.461181640625
That is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abb who may be deceived	67.33929443359375
Give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him	54.785526275634766
If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides I may not be there myself	266.6022033691406
At your ball	538.2639770507812
Why should you not be there	277.24163818359375
Because you have not yet invited me	86.73101043701172
But I come expressly for that purpose	74.05825805664062
You are very kind but I may be prevented	64.80717468261719
If I tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments	73.31861877441406
Tell me what it is	75.2220230102539
My mother begs you to come	150.84646606445312
The Comtesse de Morcerf said Monte Cristo starting	398.19122314453125
Ah count said Albert I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else	17.29712677001953
You have talked of me	105.48068237304688
Yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle	86.27123260498047
Then I am also a puzzle to your mother I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination	3374.001220703125
A problem my dear count for everyonefor my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear	63.471492767333984
My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	1.094955563545227
I believe while the Countess G takes you for Lord Ruthven my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count SaintGermain	31.119503021240234
The first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other	120.34284973144531
I thank you for the warning said the count I shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions	73.01957702636719
You will then come on Saturday	96.21685791015625
Yes since Madame de Morcerf invites me	90.01850891113281
You are very kind	196.68704223632812
Will M	83.6920166015625
Danglars be there	49.02265167236328
He has already been invited by my father	164.71121215820312
We shall try to persuade the great dAguesseau11 M	2175.377685546875
de Villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him	5315.9619140625
Never despair of anything says the proverb	544.3051147460938
Do you dance count	14.571824073791504
I dance	47.80659866333008
Yes you it would not be astonishing	31.850425720214844
That is very well before one is over forty	79.40909576416016
No I do not dance but I like to see others do so	96.28804779052734
Does Madame de Morcerf dance	89.25487518310547
Never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation	1.0365488529205322
30283 m	82.33113861083984
Yes truly and I assure you	59.14064407348633
You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest	96.108642578125
Albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door	549.0792236328125
I have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping Albert on the steps	27.374353408813477
What is it	117.26084899902344
I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars	416.8717956542969
On the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him	52.91910934448242
I am glad to be reassured on that point	95.41375732421875
Apropos when do you aspect M	107.82624053955078
Five or six days hence at the latest	73.55133819580078
And when is he to be married	174.18960571289062
Immediately on the arrival of M	91.22618103027344
and Madame de SaintMran	27.722026824951172
Bring him to see me	8233.8134765625
Although you say I do not like him I assure you I shall be happy to see him	835.2935180664062
I will obey your orders my lord	67.24057006835938
Until Saturday when I may expect you may I not	27.900291442871094
Yes I promised you	412.41448974609375
The Count watched Albert waving his hand to him	70.15225982666016
When he had mounted his phaeton Monte Cristo turned and seeing Bertuccio What news said he	133.97288513183594
She went to the Palais replied the steward	60.20901870727539
Did she stay long there	113.15847778320312
An hour and a half	17.683757781982422
Did she return home	76.0620346069336
Well my dear Bertuccio said the count I now advise you to go in quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy	27.19851303100586
Bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening	138.3038330078125
Chapter 69	2167.105224609375
The Inquiry	276.50927734375
de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars to endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the history of the house at Auteuil	49.01271057128906
He wrote the same day for the required information to M	49.27699279785156
de Boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars	59.69986343383789
At the end of the second day M	352.93988037109375
de Villefort received the following note	72.05595397949219
The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance of Lord Wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in Paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the Abb Busoni a Sicilian priest of high repute in the East where he has done much good	1.0454856157302856
de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details	72.76473999023438
The abb who was in Paris only for a month inhabited a small twostoried house behind SaintSulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant	145.01705932617188
The two lower rooms consisted of a diningroom with a table chairs and sideboard of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece	185.26504516601562
It was evident that the abb limited himself to objects of strict necessity	104.58184814453125
He preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	21.871524810791016
His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abb was not in Paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abb was known to be a great traveller	136.8752899169922
Besides whether at home or not whether in Paris or Cairo the abb always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his masters name	1885.291259765625
The other room near the library was a bedroom	112.28890228271484
A bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow Utrecht velvet composed with a prieDieu all its furniture	86.35181427001953
Lord Wilmore resided in Rue FontaineSaintGeorges	22.067075729370117
He was one of those English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling	103.81377410888672
He hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there	169.099853515625
One of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of French which he however wrote with great facility	337.3119812011719
The day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue Frou and rapping at an olivegreen door asked if the Abb Busoni were within	111.88260650634766
No he went out early this morning replied the valet	15.281542778015137
I might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home	45.05496597290039
But have the kindness to give the Abb Busoni	50.12845993041992
I told you he was not at home repeated the valet	90.49609375
Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	53.34614181518555
Will he be at home at eight oclock this evening	10.35521125793457
Doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out	136.29148864746094
I will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired	47.476844787597656
At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Frou drove up to the green door	128.4014434814453
He knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	189.62747192382812
From the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect	78.17699432373047
Is the abb at home asked he	122.73699188232422
Yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	335.771728515625
The stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abb in a monks dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the Middle Ages	1.02334725856781
Have I the honor of addressing the Abb Busoni asked the visitor	42.479122161865234
Yes sir replied the abb and you are the person whom M	232.86058044433594
de Boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police	245.6653289794922
Exactly sir	1683.3590087890625
One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris	4478.02197265625
Yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	49.02086639404297
The abb replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same	166.8353271484375
I am at your service sir said the abb with a marked Italian accent	74.91607666015625
The mission with which I am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed	152.56224060058594
The abb bowed	51.63975524902344
Your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which I am deputed to see you	94.0693359375
It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth	146.10142517089844
Provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience	79.83922576904297
I am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and God and not between me and human justice	87.1554946899414
Do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience	116.58112335205078
At this moment the abb pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	56.07670593261719
Excuse me abb said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much	27.302797317504883
The abb lowered the shade	103.80609893798828
Now sir I am listeninggo on	74.79364776611328
I will come at once to the point	101.96002960205078
Do you know the Count of Monte Cristo	110.08811950683594
You mean Monsieur Zaccone I presume	62.18839645385742
Zacconeis not his name Monte Cristo	287.7466125488281
Monte Cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name	88.87854766845703
Well be it solet us not dispute about words and since M	43.10890197753906
de Monte Cristo and M	26.763423919677734
Zaccone are the same	30.005916595458984
Absolutely the same	119.13567352294922
Let us speak of M	171.79391479492188
I asked you if you knew him	12.14199161529541
Extremely well	156.4282684326172
Who is he	128.30584716796875
The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta	115.28457641601562
I know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports	27.15978240966797
However replied the abb with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest	126.75421905517578
Are you sure of what you assert	70.60840606689453
What do you mean by that question	25.764429092407227
Understand sir I do not in the least suspect your veracity I ask if you are certain of it	83.56843566894531
I knew his father M	8.465527534484863
Ah indeed	358.8592529296875
And when a child I often played with the son in the timberyards	202.6354522705078
But whence does he derive the title of count	50.5546989440918
You are aware that may be bought	136.16600036621094
In Italy	545.1578979492188
And his immense riches whence does he procure them	60.959571838378906
They may not be so very great	263.9034729003906
How much do you suppose he possesses	118.7958755493164
From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum	188.6475830078125
That is reasonable said the visitor I have heard he had three or four millions	96.25880432128906
Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital	62.78649139404297
But I was told he had four millions per annum	115.44856262207031
That is not probable	51.53447341918945
Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo	75.49040985107422
Certainly everyone who has come from Palermo Naples or Rome to France by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it	16.469955444335938
I am told it is a delightful place	66.03182983398438
It is a rock	154.35653686523438
And why has the count bought a rock	60.14445877075195
For the sake of being a count	130.19593811035156
In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count	62.44459915161133
You have doubtless heard the adventures of M	51.461517333984375
Zaccones youth	59.9954833984375
The fathers	188.58470153808594
No the sons	25.167644500732422
I know nothing certain at that period of his life I lost sight of my young comrade	32.91817092895508
Was he in the wars	75.95026397705078
I think he entered the service	27.5541934967041
In what branch	49.165042877197266
In the navy	162.98519897460938
Are you not his confessor	497.3565673828125
No sir I believe he is a Lutheran	45.70757293701172
A Lutheran	101.4308853149414
I say I believe such is the case I do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in France	1638.61181640625
Doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police I ask you what you know of him	93.07723236083984
He passes for a very charitable man	627.568359375
Our holy father the pope has made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the Christians in the East he has five or six rings as testimonials from Eastern monarchs of his services	63.13688659667969
Does he wear them	25.843626022338867
No but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers	74.11050415039062
He is a Quaker then	97.9552993774414
Exactly he is a Quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress	123.83431243896484
Has he any friends	111.6436996459961
Yes everyone who knows him is his friend	183.23880004882812
But has he any enemies	71.48794555664062
One only	69.5056381225586
What is his name	99.5087890625
Lord Wilmore	22.780710220336914
Where is he	18.179746627807617
He is in Paris just now	34.64198684692383
Can he give me any particulars	98.333251953125
Important ones he was in India with Zaccone	31.668350219726562
Do you know his abode	25.583887100219727
Its somewhere in the Chausse dAntin but I know neither the street nor the number	24.689327239990234
30289 m	103.75284576416016
Are you at variance with the Englishman	165.29800415039062
I love Zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends	194.4998779296875
Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before he made this visit to Paris	28.825273513793945
To that question I can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as I did not know when I might again come to Paris I recommended M	63.66922378540039
Cavalcanti to him	11.919925689697266
No Bartolomeo his father	517.6177368164062
Now sir I have but one question more to ask and I charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly	118.22045135498047
What is it sir	266.81549072265625
Do you know with what design M	61.46165466308594
de Monte Cristo purchased a house at Auteuil	84.31262969970703
Certainly for he told me	90.54737091064453
What is it sir	216.97274780273438
To make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Palermo	569.5845947265625
Do you know about that institution	596.5473022460938
I have heard of it	1391.49755859375
It is a magnificent charity	90.9205322265625
Having said this the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies	38.45097351074219
The visitor either understood the abbs meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abb accompanied him to the door	146.11431884765625
You are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich I will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering	110.77577209472656
I thank you sir I am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources	569.5223999023438
My resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence	57.42654037475586
The abb once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M	83.8918685913086
de Villefort	46.018672943115234
An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the Rue FontaineSaintGeorges and stopped at No	262.7337646484375
5 where Lord Wilmore lived	90.96697998046875
The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oclock	1.026771068572998
As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that Lord Wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck	170.75831604003906
The visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawingrooms	83.08440399169922
A mantlepiece with two modern Svres vases a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each sideone representing Homer carrying his guide the other Belisarius begginga grayish paper red and black tapestrysuch was the appearance of Lord Wilmores drawingroom	52.444759368896484
It was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak sight	25.01209831237793
After ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared	58.87019729614258
He was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray	115.13553619384766
He was dressed with all the English peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	117.38140869140625
His first remark on entering was	24.566890716552734
You know sir I do not speak French	92.97728729248047
I know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	132.54299926757812
But you may use it replied Lord Wilmore I understand it	54.56576919555664
And I replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of English to keep up the conversation	294.6400146484375
Do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience	200.27017211914062
Aw said Lord Wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of Great Britain	61.26823806762695
The envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with English coolness and having finished	131.5578155517578
I understand said he perfectly	83.77154541015625
30293 m	106.64866638183594
Then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abb Busoni	117.60159301757812
But as Lord Wilmore in the character of the counts enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of Monte Cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English	30.193246841430664
It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to England and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming	163.9362030029297
Then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in Greece broke out and he had served in the Grecian ranks	194.6446075439453
While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone	125.46328735351562
After the battle of Navarino when the Greek government was consolidated he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district which was given him	77.90139770507812
Hence that immense fortune which in Lord Wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	131.89639282226562
But asked the visitor do you know why he came to France	188.85791015625
He is speculating in railways said Lord Wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection	44.42916488647461
How much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	54.323204040527344
Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said Lord Wilmore he is a miser	13.876874923706055
Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	89.82804107666016
Do you know his house at Auteuil	85.969970703125
What do you know respecting it	47.52366256713867
Do you wish to know why he bought it	449.6746520996094
The count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	33.930747985839844
He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnres Luchon and Cauterets	86.45160675048828
He is going to turn his house into a Badhaus as the Germans term it	87.01932525634766
He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses	215.307861328125
Now as I dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him I am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place	60.44115447998047
What was the cause of your quarrel	65.9690170288086
When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends	95.08080291748047
Why do you not seek revenge	45.72005081176758
I have already fought three duels with him said the Englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre	104.48824310302734
And what was the result of those duels	31.910640716552734
The first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound	144.55332946777344
The Englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one	136.687255859375
So that you see there is a deadly feud between us	118.77079010009766
But said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if I understand you correctly	66.49516296386719
Aw said the Englishman I practice shooting every day and every other day Grisier comes to my house	803.7598876953125
This was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the Englishman appeared to know	79.01050567626953
The agent arose and having bowed to Lord Wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the English he retired	98.5855484008789
Lord Wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo	69.14089965820312
It was M	28.566068649291992
de Villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of M	114.79701232910156
de Villefort	102.28360748291016
The procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinnerparty at Auteuil he slept soundly	315.79705810546875
Chapter 70	31.498079299926758
The Ball	105.82443237304688
It was in the warmest days of July when in due course of time the Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M	177.19577026367188
de Morcerfs	97.68313598632812
It was ten oclock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the counts house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered	1645.8819580078125
From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds	28.479921340942383
At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase	234.58221435546875
Until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	49.833457946777344
The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the Italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the suppertable was loaded with waxlights and flowers	79.31024169921875
30297 m	59.60321044921875
At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of Mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	49.226139068603516
Madame Danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort	139.60008239746094
The latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said	19.377765655517578
You are going to Madame de Morcerfs are you not	81.47589111328125
No replied Madame Danglars I am too ill	78.27864074707031
You are wrong replied Villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there	79.62680053710938
Do you think so asked the baroness	76.45890045166016
I do	183.78326416015625
In that case I will go	83.76396179199219
And the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	218.55418395996094
Madame Danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when Mercds appeared at the door	127.09107971191406
The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars	70.62779998779297
He approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat	126.17024993896484
Albert looked around him	108.44303131103516
You are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling	35.03410720825195
I confess it replied Albert	234.7349395751953
Could you have been so cruel as not to bring her	526.154052734375
Calm yourself	93.4537353515625
She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	69.2142333984375
But tell me	232.27207946777344
Well what do you wish to know	120.92416381835938
Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight	49.91975784301758
Seventeen replied Albert	481.2743225097656
What do you mean	81.2604751586914
I only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question	133.2325439453125
The count is in fashion I congratulate him upon it	236.53675842285156
And have you replied to everyone as you have to me	81.32001495361328
Ah to be sure I have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones	25.217510223388672
Were you at the Opera yesterday	140.09695434570312
He was there	94.5162582397461
Ah indeed And did the eccentric person commit any new originality	137.77212524414062
Can he be seen without doing so Elssler was dancing in Le Diable boiteux the Greek princess was in ecstasies	121.92228698730469
After the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger	243.17657470703125
And the Greek princesswill she be here	133.03961181640625
No you will be deprived of that pleasure her position in the counts establishment is not sufficiently understood	59.51542282104492
Wait leave me here and go and speak to Madame de Villefort who is trying to attract your attention	152.99050903320312
Albert bowed to Madame Danglars and advanced towards Madame de Villefort whose lips opened as he approached	83.89374542236328
I wager anything said Albert interrupting her that I know what you were about to say	70.26963806152344
Well what is it	144.77870178222656
If I guess rightly will you confess it	130.32717895507812
On your honor	115.45368194580078
On my honor	64.98906707763672
You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived or was expected	1.0084929466247559
Not at all	30.9416561126709
It is not of him that I am now thinking	224.4559783935547
I was going to ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz	76.8747787475586
What did he tell you	109.80715942382812
That he was leaving at the same time as his letter	272.5636291503906
Well now then the count	62.756202697753906
The count will come of that you may be satisfied	345.5990295410156
You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo	147.83758544921875
No I did not know it	98.42754364013672
Monte Cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name	59.054664611816406
I never heard it	72.21400451660156
Well then I am better informed than you his name is Zaccone	120.21076965332031
It is possible	99.90115356445312
He is a Maltese	1.068354606628418
That is also possible	174.18560791015625
The son of a shipowner	164.3095703125
Really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success	134.61990356445312
He served in India discovered a mine in Thessaly and comes to Paris to establish a mineral watercure at Auteuil	52.44615936279297
Well I m sure said Morcerf this is indeed news Am I allowed to repeat it	247.4002227783203
Yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say I told you	9.41748046875
Why so	20.07539176940918
Because it is a secret just discovered	62.89451599121094
By whom	84.14065551757812
The police	35.607852935791016
Then the news originated	9.740577697753906
At the prefects last night	93.49585723876953
Paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries	299.32171630859375
Well well Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich	38.284332275390625
Indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable	8.02770709991455
Poor count And is he aware of the danger he has been in	778.7359008789062
I think not	65.31041717529297
Then it will be but charitable to inform him	97.10818481445312
When he arrives I will not fail to do so	165.72442626953125
Just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort	65.86749267578125
Albert extended his hand	214.1502227783203
Madame said Albert allow me to present to you M	177.0008544921875
Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers	495.1393737792969
I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo replied Madame de Villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner	91.86827850341797
This answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor Morrel	219.45782470703125
But a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips	183.60089111328125
The salutation was so well understood that Morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	74.07298278808594
They might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction	57.877464294433594
The Count of Monte Cristo had just entered	69.82024383544922
We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared	94.20089721679688
It was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attentionit was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdainthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him	98.27030181884766
Many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used	117.90388488769531
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood	350.5728759765625
Yet the Parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune	280.1158447265625
30301 m	108.94437408447266
Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf who standing before a mantlepiece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a lookingglass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him	229.4891815185547
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her	81.50891876220703
No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert who received him cordially	123.64102172851562
Have you seen my mother asked Albert	58.35118865966797
I have just had the pleasure replied the count but I have not seen your father	74.0242919921875
See he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses	76.04088592529297
Indeed said Monte Cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	140.18295288085938
I should not have guessed it	54.424346923828125
And for what kind of talent are they celebrated You know there are different sorts	33.035640716552734
That tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of Rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the Institute	49.3926887512207
The thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	69.7310791015625
I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor was made an officer	146.6812286376953
Come said Monte Cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	17.501611709594727
I suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander	660.1404418945312
Very likely said Albert	112.00318908691406
And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green	206.4142303466797
Oh that coat is not his own idea it is the Republics which deputed David12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians	68.71900177001953
Indeed said Monte Cristo so this gentleman is an Academician	273.61993408203125
Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly	1.1672555208206177
And what is his especial talent	18.461387634277344
His talent I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone	115.02852630615234
And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this	127.14222717285156
No of the French Academy	147.69003295898438
But what has the French Academy to do with all this	78.68952178955078
I was going to tell you	254.8700714111328
It seems	533.6470336914062
That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless	201.64776611328125
No that his style of writing is very good	108.0825424194336
This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out	19.117801666259766
Albert laughed	194.0099639892578
And the other one demanded the count	1196.4490966796875
That one	709.0193481445312
Yes the third	88.27094268798828
The one in the dark blue coat	32.41196060180664
He is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform	221.656494140625
He was very successful upon that question	73.11748504638672
He stood badly with the Liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists	324.6518859863281
They talk of making him an ambassador	586.8326416015625
30303 m	78.93679809570312
And what are his claims to the peerage	170.38589477539062
He has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the Sicle and voted five or six years on the ministerial side	111.00594329833984
Bravo viscount said Monte Cristo smiling you are a delightful cicerone	95.58976745605469
And now you will do me a favor will you not	129.87660217285156
What is it	68.99888610839844
Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me	103.1132583618164
Just then the count felt his arm pressed	18.18294906616211
He turned round it was Danglars	69.48787689208984
Ah is it you baron said he	109.72164154052734
Why do you call me baron said Danglars you know that I care nothing for my title	40.98571014404297
I am not like you viscount you like your title do you not	46.800697326660156
Certainly replied Albert seeing that without my title I should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire	171.2063446044922
Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July replied Danglars	98.47274780273438
Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of France or academician for example the millionaires Franck   Poulmann of Frankfurt who have just become bankrupts	87.84735870361328
Indeed said Danglars becoming pale	241.772705078125
Yes I received the news this evening by a courier	9.41748046875
I had about a million in their hands but warned in time I withdrew it a month ago	111.67063903808594
Ah mon Dieu exclaimed Danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs	85.6830825805664
Well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent	83.9776840209961
Yes but it is too late said Danglars I have honored their bills	631.4492797851562
Then said Monte Cristo here are 200000 francs gone after	34.54852294921875
Hush do not mention these things said Danglars then approaching Monte Cristo he added especially before young M	52.51853561401367
Cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question	152.1433563232422
Albert had left the count to speak to his mother Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti Monte Cristo was for an instant alone	124.43302917480469
Meanwhile the heat became excessive	217.4459686279297
The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices	36.5784797668457
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment	104.78461456298828
Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	30.61539077758789
Albert she asked did you notice that	199.16159057617188
What mother	78.12832641601562
That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of M	135.53536987304688
de Morcerf	51.44902801513672
Yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion	212.2440185546875
But your house is not M	20.848060607910156
de Morcerfs murmured Mercds and since he has been here I have watched him	43.18043518066406
Well he has taken nothing yet	65.66293334960938
The count is very temperate	106.32648468017578
Mercds smiled sadly	239.02081298828125
Approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something	341.70086669921875
But why mother	232.66358947753906
Just to please me Albert said Mercds	91.00447082519531
Albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the count	101.04801940917969
Another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused	102.91447448730469
Albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	61.40892028808594
Well said she you see he refuses	84.48169708251953
Yes but why need this annoy you	71.36669158935547
You know Albert women are singular creatures	80.64044952392578
I should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice	293.8949279785156
Perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the French style of living and might prefer something else	37.85953903198242
Oh no I have seen him eat of everything in Italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening	60.97209930419922
And besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do	262.1481018066406
I do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows	651.0216064453125
In a word said Mercds it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended	30.585697174072266
And she left the room	300.1223449707031
A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent	88.83478546142578
Dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in	116.82748413085938
At the same time Mercds reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore	116.296630859375
She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre	103.893310546875
Do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer I should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing	201.13706970214844
Ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung Partant pour la Syriewe will not go alone to the garden	37.36891174316406
Then said Mercds I will lead the way	110.03521728515625
Turning towards Monte Cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm	74.5633316040039
The count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on Mercds	166.28009033203125
It was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look	10.58067798614502
He offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	263.5102844238281
Behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight	146.69081115722656
Chapter 71	18.216064453125
Bread and Salt	89.10523223876953
Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion	47.47899627685547
It led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	7.801332473754883
It was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	1.17221999168396
Yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds	106.28426361083984
As he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of Mercds tremble	76.85784912109375
But you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold	74.3827896118164
Do you know where I am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	5.364718437194824
No madame replied Monte Cristo but you see I make no resistance	117.64387512207031
We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove	37.013362884521484
The count looked at Mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking	33.32209777832031
They reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate	18.380783081054688
The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes	37.079307556152344
See count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our French grapes are not to be compared I know with yours of Sicily and Cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun	61.534873962402344
The count bowed but stepped back	164.1742401123047
Do you refuse said Mercds in a tremulous voice	74.03205871582031
Pray excuse me madame replied Monte Cristo but I never eat Muscatel grapes	43.16817855834961
Mercds let them fall and sighed	88.30985260009766
A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat	19.373363494873047
Mercds drew near and plucked the fruit	103.20012664794922
Take this peach then she said	286.4889831542969
The count again refused	203.5937042236328
What again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me	28.48423194885254
A long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	208.14430236816406
Count added Mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful Arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof	3074.618896484375
I know it madame replied the count but we are in France and not in Arabia and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another	7889.4814453125
But said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not	36.38930892944336
The count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	162.3651123046875
Certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be	56.9753532409668
The answer was so little like the one Mercds desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	41.5196533203125
Thank you she said	30.544179916381836
And they walked on again	182.1071319580078
They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	50.69453811645508
Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply	90.28679656982422
I have suffered deeply madame answered Monte Cristo	66.6448974609375
But now you are happy	53.358009338378906
Doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain	714.6729125976562
And your present happiness has it softened your heart	97.55094146728516
My present happiness equals my past misery said the count	57.6090087890625
Are you not married asked the countess	1577.7412109375
I married exclaimed Monte Cristo shuddering who could have told you so	119.42079162597656
No one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely woman	207.3053436279297
She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	152.5610809326172
I have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world	3320.3369140625
You live alone then	62.21663284301758
I do	74.751220703125
You have no sisterno sonno father	115.73424530029297
I have no one	81.66488647460938
How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life	117.917724609375
It is not my fault madame	7.067459583282471
At Malta I loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away	345.4580078125
I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	68.03662109375
When I returned she was married	91.3270263671875
This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age	137.07411193847656
Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and I suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all	721.4359130859375
The countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath	82.53077697753906
Yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again	146.11563110351562
30309 m	48.81558609008789
I never returned to the country where she lived	22.29435157775879
To Malta	30.53895378112793
Yes Malta	19.206422805786133
She is then now at Malta	124.43392181396484
I think so	54.767452239990234
And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer	331.7266540527344
But only her do you then still hate those who separated you	64.56172180175781
I hate them Not at all why should I The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	33.078758239746094
Take some she said	117.27600860595703
Madame I never eat Muscatel grapes replied Monte Cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before	188.32949829101562
The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair	53.20295333862305
Inflexible man she murmured	86.69991302490234
Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him	34.487396240234375
Albert at this moment ran in	54.51462936401367
Oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened	66.90902709960938
What What has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune Indeed I should expect misfortunes	143.36495971679688
de Villefort is here	48.137332916259766
He comes to fetch his wife and daughter	20.598485946655273
Why so	286.5256042480469
Because Madame de SaintMran is just arrived in Paris bringing the news of M	84.43450164794922
de SaintMrans death which took place on the first stage after he left Marseilles	66.80669403076172
Madame de Villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but Mademoiselle Valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless	497.5204772949219
And how was M	16.179338455200195
de SaintMran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort said the count	22.877899169921875
He was her grandfather on the mothers side	46.01959228515625
He was coming here to hasten her marriage with Franz	254.37445068359375
Ah indeed	60.9111328125
So Franz must wait	68.652587890625
Why was not M	80.21980285644531
de SaintMran also grandfather to Mademoiselle Danglars	28.828332901000977
Albert Albert said Madame de Morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying Ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss	59.17076873779297
And she took two or three steps forward	25.71465492248535
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together	84.24745178222656
We are friends are we not she asked	117.33680725097656
Oh madame I do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times I am your most respectful servant	189.90834045410156
The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes	102.3772964477539
Do not my mother and you agree asked Albert astonished	173.3551788330078
On the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends	145.51573181152344
They reentered the drawingroom which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted	210.3638916015625
It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time	211.12904357910156
Chapter 72	204.28677368164062
Madame de SaintMran	158.94204711914062
A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M	25.523813247680664
de Villefort	124.9639663696289
After the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires	183.99545288085938
But this time the papers were a mere matter of form	31.926498413085938
Villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections	200.63540649414062
Then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies	28.940645217895508
Their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	4.351946830749512
When he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head	123.86820983886719
No he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret	125.56233215332031
Sometimes as Hamlet says	113.13086700439453
Foul deeds will rise	42.63747024536133
Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes	382.60089111328125
but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead	39.88530349731445
The story has been told by the Corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it	202.0711669921875
de Monte Cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself	30.383760452270508
But why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked Villefort after a moments reflection what interest can this M	14.576983451843262
de Monte Cristo or M	44.16876220703125
Zacconeson of a shipowner of Malta discoverer of a mine in Thessaly now visiting Paris for the first timewhat interest I say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this However among all the incoherent details given to me by the Abb Busoni and by Lord Wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me	143.308837890625
But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	25.17177963256836
He dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	79.94963073730469
While he was endeavoring to calm his fearsand instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long sleptthe noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief	11.48629379272461
He drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	14.93443775177002
The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief	163.92477416992188
Oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune I shall die of it oh yes I shall certainly die of it	18.447946548461914
And then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	140.5533447265625
The servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at Noirtiers old servant who had heard the noise from his masters room and run there also remaining behind the others	223.4972381591797
Villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	33.8784065246582
Why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you Is M	60.59950256347656
de SaintMran with you	149.6632080078125
de SaintMran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied	432.7657775878906
Villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed	3476.916748046875
Deadso suddenly	1.0217609405517578
A week ago continued Madame de SaintMran we went out together in the carriage after dinner	1.1423420906066895
de SaintMran had been unwell for some days still the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave	971.200439453125
At six leagues from Marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still I hesitated to wake him although I fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual	117.9687271118164
However as it became dark and I could no longer see I fell asleep I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently	88.30845642089844
I called the valet I stopped the postilion I spoke to M	158.39910888671875
de SaintMran I applied my smellingsalts but all was over and I arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse	72.58577728271484
Villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	87.2982406616211
Of course you sent for a doctor	77.42076873779297
Immediately but as I have told you it was too late	188.7965087890625
Yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died	40.49699020385742
Oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke	122.66316223144531
And what did you do then	166.48263549804688
de SaintMran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from Paris that his body might be brought to the family vault	115.12197875976562
I had him put into a leaden coffin and I am preceding him by a few days	129.09068298339844
Oh my poor mother said Villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow	49.74873352050781
God has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him	71.55584716796875
It is true that since I left him I seem to have lost my senses	143.6448211669922
I can not cry at my age they say that we have no more tearsstill I think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping	856.241943359375
Where is Valentine sir It is on her account I am here I wish to see Valentine	30.125988006591797
30315 m	41.5753059387207
Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	593.6631469726562
This instant sirthis instant I beseech you said the old lady	79.39322662353516
Villefort placed the arm of Madame de SaintMran within his own and conducted her to his apartment	122.57481384277344
Rest yourself mother he said	160.57301330566406
The marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeplyregretted child who still lived for her in Valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head	78.13115692138672
Villefort left her to the care of the women while old Barrois ran halfscared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person	37.55907440185547
Then while Madame de SaintMran remained on her knees praying fervently Villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de Morcerfs	152.26231384277344
He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that Valentine ran to him saying	204.70675659179688
Oh father some misfortune has happened	90.68244171142578
Your grandmamma has just arrived Valentine said M	37.46229934692383
de Villefort	45.79365539550781
And grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	2799.55517578125
de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	124.80162048339844
It was just in time for Valentines head swam and she staggered Madame de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying	104.9684066772461
What a singular event Who could have thought it Ah yes it is indeed strange	424.3453369140625
And the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	69.57573699951172
At the foot of the stairs Valentine found Barrois awaiting her	387.2596740722656
Noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	66.17443084716797
Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was Madame de SaintMran	73.13658905029297
Valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while Madame de Villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow	1.336254358291626
She soon whispered to her husband	203.3573455810547
I think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your motherinlaw	171.78170776367188
Madame de SaintMran heard her	1.0454856157302856
Yes yes she said softly to Valentine let her leave but do you stay	104.94563293457031
Madame de Villefort left and Valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife	196.31748962402344
Meanwhile Barrois had returned for the first time to old Noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	83.09276580810547
Alas sir exclaimed Barrois a great misfortune has happened	172.98385620117188
Madame de SaintMran has arrived and her husband is dead	20.211910247802734
de SaintMran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another	407.0208740234375
Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful then he closed one eye in token of inquiry	34.63285827636719
Barrois asked Mademoiselle Valentine	56.423274993896484
Noirtier nodded his head	142.68582153320312
She is at the ball as you know since she came to say goodbye to you in full dress	25.722919464111328
Noirtier again closed his left eye	85.44506072998047
Do you wish to see her Noirtier again made an affirmative sign	33.11545944213867
Well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from Madame de Morcerfs I will await her return and beg her to come up here	39.914527893066406
Is that what you wish for	169.47471618652344
Yes replied the invalid	544.8959350585938
Barrois therefore as we have seen watched for Valentine and informed her of her grandfathers wish	110.67799377441406
Consequently Valentine came up to Noirtier on leaving Madame de SaintMran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep	59.86845397949219
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	48.320560455322266
Then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see M	176.29541015625
Valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted	96.66016387939453
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	194.64942932128906
Yes yes said Valentine you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather left do you not	42.1198844909668
The old man intimated that such was his meaning	106.77001953125
Ah yes happily I have replied Valentine	54.860267639160156
Without that what would become of me	116.37085723876953
It was one oclock in the morning	1.2991877794265747
Barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	65.29979705810547
Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her goodnight for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill	337.96563720703125
The next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability	964.1655883789062
Oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed Valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation	59.99699783325195
No my child no said Madame de SaintMran but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival that I might send for your father	357.55328369140625
My father inquired Valentine uneasily	139.89820861816406
Yes I wish to speak to him	110.09782409667969
Valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards Villefort entered	40.308841705322266
Sir said Madame de SaintMran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child	150.28732299804688
Yes madame replied Villefort it is not only projected but arranged	27.294471740722656
Your intended soninlaw is named M	250.1261749267578
Franz dpinay	32.50382614135742
Yes madame	119.29244995117188
Is he not the son of General dpinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of Elba	41.64990234375
The same	18.439481735229492
Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a Jacobin	9.696337699890137
Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said Villefort M	89.22381591796875
dpinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of M	160.8662109375
Noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference	31.12176513671875
Is it a suitable match	142.85704040527344
In every respect	19.826644897460938
And the young man	259.7114562988281
Is regarded with universal esteem	45.690181732177734
You approve of him	113.25780487060547
He is one of the most wellbred young men I know	151.21945190429688
During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent	208.4615478515625
Well sir said Madame de SaintMran after a few minutes reflection I must hasten the marriage for I have but a short time to live	55.52605438232422
You madame You dear mamma exclaimed M	73.30120849609375
de Villefort and Valentine at the same time	1.1367254257202148
I know what I am saying continued the marchioness I must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage	174.00779724121094
I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor Rene whom you have so soon forgotten sir	83.5421371459961
Ah madame said Villefort you forget that I was obliged to give a mother to my child	169.30242919921875
A stepmother is never a mother sir	86.7063217163086
But this is not to the purposeour business concerns Valentine let us leave the dead in peace	146.7891845703125
All this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium	43.30967712402344
It shall be as you wish madame said Villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as M	176.69931030273438
dpinay arrives in Paris	131.42189025878906
30319 m	85.30424499511719
My dear grandmother interrupted Valentine consider decorumthe recent death	102.14134216308594
You would not have me marry under such sad auspices	13.8541841506958
My child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future	400.55523681640625
I also was married at the deathbed of my mother and certainly I have not been less happy on that account	97.90552520751953
Still that idea of death madame said Villefort	102.6906967163086
StillAlways I tell you I am going to diedo you understand Well before dying I wish to see my soninlaw	114.59280395507812
I wish to tell him to make my child happy I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey mein fact I will know himI will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty	17.057472229003906
Madame said Villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness	4.629002094268799
The dead once buried in their graves rise no more	60.41548538208008
And I tell you sir that you are mistaken	127.72521209716797
This night I have had a fearful sleep	2039.804443359375
It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which I tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir I saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into Madame Villeforts dressingroomI saw I tell you silently enter a white figure	79.59002685546875
Valentine screamed	14.765743255615234
It was the fever that disturbed you madame said Villefort	147.55665588378906
30321 m	56.25483322143555
Doubt if you please but I am sure of what I say	160.4798583984375
I saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses I heard my glass removedthe same which is there now on the table	86.21025085449219
Oh dear mother it was a dream	115.54318237304688
So little was it a dream that I stretched my hand towards the bell but when I did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light	21.478790283203125
But she saw no one	79.8984375
Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them	35.68219757080078
It was the soul of my husbandWell if my husbands soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter the tie is even more direct it seems to me	34.27686309814453
Oh madame said Villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget	77.60953521728516
Never never never said the marchioness	87.73792266845703
When does M	75.87557983398438
dpinay return	33.012351989746094
We expect him every moment	234.2884521484375
It is well	63.01802062988281
As soon as he arrives inform me	23.00624656677246
We must be expeditious	77.7019271850586
And then I also wish to see a notary that I may be assured that all our property returns to Valentine	48.96084976196289
Ah grandmamma murmured Valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me Oh how feverish you are we must not send for a notary but for a doctor	285.37408447265625
A doctor said she shrugging her shoulders I am not ill I am thirstythat is all	42.75230026245117
30323 m	159.4934539794922
What are you drinking dear grandmamma	5.077752113342285
The same as usual my dear my glass is there on the tablegive it to me Valentine	249.76730346679688
Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre	62.26007843017578
The marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating	124.64859771728516
The notary the notary	108.12702941894531
de Villefort left the room and Valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother	60.38734436035156
The poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	215.32150268554688
A bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement	1.2567353248596191
She was thinking of the despair of Maximilian when he should be informed that Madame de SaintMran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy	37.140010833740234
More than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de ChteauRenaud but Morrel was of plebeian extraction and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de SaintMran despised all who were not noble	347.7393798828125
Her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	694.3670043945312
Two hours passed thus Madame de SaintMran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	716.2426147460938
Though his coming was announced in a very low tone Madame de SaintMran arose from her pillow	105.03313446044922
The notary she exclaimed let him come in	1750.9288330078125
The notary who was at the door immediately entered	51.85703659057617
Go Valentine said Madame de SaintMran and leave me with this gentleman	46.350868225097656
But grandmamma	300.51055908203125
Leave mego	312.7813415527344
The young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the diningroom	136.9168701171875
Valentine instantly ran down	55.74491882324219
The doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of Valentine whose birth he had witnessed	74.69222259521484
He had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	86.66837310791016
Oh said Valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear M	196.07528686523438
But first of all how are Madeleine and Antoinette	81.46563720703125
Madeleine was the daughter of M	71.48957824707031
dAvrigny and Antoinette his niece	23.1828670501709
dAvrigny smiled sadly	144.27911376953125
Antoinette is very well he said and Madeleine tolerably so	31.683046340942383
But you sent for me my dear child	112.45404815673828
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill	840.3729248046875
As for you although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field	56.39610290527344
Valentine colored	129.4015350341797
dAvrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind	181.11599731445312
30325 m	1915.5867919921875
No she replied it is for my poor grandmother	167.6224365234375
You know the calamity that has happened to us do you not	228.9025115966797
I know nothing	60.40249252319336
said M	121.6813735961914
Alas said Valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead	124.99513244628906
de SaintMran	83.90447235107422
From an apoplectic stroke	51.809173583984375
An apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor	49.09650421142578
Yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him	1.2567353248596191
Oh M	14.4896240234375
dAvrigny I beseech you do something for her	156.58042907714844
Where is she	196.7055206298828
In her room with the notary	60.78984832763672
And M	77.6002426147461
Just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking	658.4073486328125
And the same love for youeh my dear child	767.28515625
Yes said Valentine he was very fond of me	53.79655456542969
Who does not love you Valentine smiled sadly	63.58939743041992
What are your grandmothers symptoms	77.75236511230469
An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched	401.3387451171875
It must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass	104.43942260742188
It is singular said the doctor I was not aware that Madame de SaintMran was subject to such hallucinations	113.89688110351562
It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition said Valentine and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad and my father who you know is a strongminded man himself appeared deeply impressed	127.31471252441406
We will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange	60.295101165771484
The notary here descended and Valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone	85.83255004882812
Go upstairs she said to the doctor	426.5057678222656
And you	57.72606658935547
Oh I dare notshe forbade my sending for you and as you say I am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts	128.27281188964844
I will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself	66.07063293457031
The doctor pressed Valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps	72.85260772705078
We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	62.09043884277344
After remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	7.067459583282471
As usual Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them	331.95404052734375
The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe	151.12379455566406
30327 m	449.85931396484375
She then turned towards the avenue	43.6147575378418
As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name	106.22159576416016
She stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of Maximilian	174.5051727294922
Chapter 73	75.1951675415039
The Promise	39.90074157714844
It was indeed Maximilian Morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day	46.215328216552734
With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de SaintMran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at M	1.0375454425811768
de Villeforts in connection with his attachment for Valentine	135.01333618164062
His presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnuttrees	96.42662048339844
Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy	171.7227325439453
Morrel called her and she ran to the gate	97.72119903564453
You here at this hour said she	4.351946830749512
Yes my poor girl replied Morrel I come to bring and to hear bad tidings	56.10979461669922
This is indeed a house of mourning said Valentine speak Maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full	47.71332931518555
Dear Valentine said Morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen I entreat you what I am about to say is very serious	40.16167068481445
When are you to be married	15.017072677612305
I will tell you all said Valentine from you I have nothing to conceal	168.9091033935547
This morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom I depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of M	158.5096435546875
dpinay and the following day the contract will be signed	36.54209899902344
A deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved	10.28555679321289
Alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips	358.6852722167969
The sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and I will not endeavor to prevent it	143.8796844482422
But since you say nothing remains but for M	31.99285316467285
dpinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to M	73.62763214111328
dpinay for he came this morning to Paris	1.0454856157302856
Valentine uttered a cry	70.36231231689453
I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since said Morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and I of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard	400.4910888671875
Never till then had I placed any confidence in presentiments but now I can not help believing them Valentine	840.3729248046875
At the sound of that carriage I shuddered soon I heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan	576.564453125
The door at last opened Albert de Morcerf entered first and I began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed Ah here is the Baron Franz dpinay I summoned all my strength and courage to my support	22.877063751220703
Perhaps I turned pale and trembled but certainly I smiled and five minutes after I left without having heard one word that had passed	98.4566879272461
Poor Maximilian murmured Valentine	231.93594360351562
Valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	20.545665740966797
And remember my life depends on your answer	69.08537292480469
What do you intend doing Valentine held down her head she was overwhelmed	36.42905807495117
Listen said Morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret	23.483015060424805
There are such in the world and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	7.7150397300720215
Do you intend to struggle against our illfortune Tell me Valentine for it is that I came to know	85.6032485961914
Valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement	33.383514404296875
The idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her	6.126439571380615
What do you say Maximilian asked Valentine	63.42375564575195
What do you mean by a struggle Oh it would be a sacrilege	9.925239562988281
What I resist my fathers order and my dying grandmothers wish Impossible	62.67393493652344
Morrel started	1.1436446905136108
You are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear Maximilian	29.074731826782227
No no I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	603.4989624023438
But to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever	110.91827392578125
You are right said Morrel calmly	38.79229736328125
In what a tone you speak cried Valentine	121.11090850830078
I speak as one who admires you mademoiselle	593.907470703125
Mademoiselle cried Valentine mademoiselle Oh selfish man he sees me in despair and pretends he can not understand me	1267.5609130859375
You mistakeI understand you perfectly	653.504150390625
You will not oppose M	77.45429229736328
Villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband	1.1748836040496826
But mon Dieu tell me how can I do otherwise	122.69966888427734
Do not appeal to me mademoiselle I shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied Morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation	200.95423889160156
What would you have proposed Maximilian had you found me willing to accede	497.4729919433594
It is not for me to say	73.71344757080078
You are wrong you must advise me what to do	175.4930877685547
Do you seriously ask my advice Valentine	102.14197540283203
Certainly dear Maximilian for if it is good I will follow it you know my devotion to you	33.079017639160156
Valentine said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain	60.65156555175781
Oh if you refuse my advice	62.19740676879883
What do you advise said Valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	41.34698486328125
I am free replied Maximilian and rich enough to support you	264.50543212890625
I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead	62.221763610839844
You make me tremble said the young girl	47.22105026245117
Follow me said Morrel I will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours	67.91043853759766
We will embark for Algiers for England for America or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to Paris when our friends have reconciled your family	53.76575469970703
Valentine shook her head	53.26572799682617
I feared it Maximilian said she it is the counsel of a madman and I should be more mad than you did I not stop you at once with the word Impossible Morrel impossible	93.78573608398438
You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said Morrel sorrowfully	259.55621337890625
Yesif I die	80.23866271972656
Well Valentine resumed Maximilian I can only say again that you are right	43.19806671142578
Truly it is I who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most wellmeaning	179.19168090820312
I appreciate your calm reasoning	136.67845153808594
It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to M	125.48177337646484
Franz dpinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will	537.1824340820312
Again you drive me to despair Maximilian said Valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound What would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition	25.682235717773438
Mademoiselle replied Morrel with a bitter smile I am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man I think not of what others would do in my situation but of what I intend doing myself	196.72344970703125
I think only that I have known you not a whole year	230.96946716308594
From the day I first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection	78.09171295166016
One day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me	26.91066551208496
Now I think no more I say only that fortune has turned against meI had thought to gain heaven and now I have lost it	149.7493133544922
It is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not	92.11294555664062
Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness Valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart	131.96929931640625
But in a word what are you going to do asked she	60.543582916259766
I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory	114.15705108642578
Oh murmured Valentine	270.47808837890625
Adieu Valentine adieu said Morrel bowing	156.55287170410156
Where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing Maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lovers calmness could not be real where are you going	111.73465728759766
I am going that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as I am may follow	157.2754364013672
Before you leave me tell me what you are going to do Maximilian	41.435401916503906
The young man smiled sorrowfully	40.47952651977539
Speak speak said Valentine I entreat you	102.92929077148438
Has your resolution changed Valentine	171.0277099609375
It can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl	174.82949829101562
Then adieu Valentine	761.3043212890625
Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as Morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them	33.35057830810547
I must know what you mean to do said she	40.58430099487305
Where are you going	217.1404266357422
Oh fear not said Maximilian stopping at a short distance I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	144.3202667236328
Another might threaten to seek M	274.04443359375
Franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly	67.57630157470703
What has M	57.75902557373047
Franz to do with it He saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	36.97771072387695
He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united	122.19572448730469
I have no enmity against M	93.5393295288086
Franz and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him	55.83039474487305
On whom thenon me	81.35798645019531
On you Valentine Oh Heaven forbid Woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy	68.35839080810547
On yourself then unhappy man on yourself	30.961633682250977
I am the only guilty person am I not said Maximilian	50.629676818847656
Maximilian said Valentine Maximilian come back I entreat you	334.2820129394531
He drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood	104.3589859008789
Listen my dear my adored Valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others hearts	78.03948974609375
I never was romantic and am no melancholy hero	88.97620391845703
I imitate neither Manfred nor Anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing soI repeat it you are right but in losing you I lose my life	102.5278091430664
The moment you leave me Valentine I am alone in the world	120.52001190185547
My sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	43.73868179321289
This is what I shall do I will wait until the very moment you are married for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since M	56.574440002441406
Franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned	1.1098661422729492
I will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless I will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river I will put an end to my existence as certainly as I am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in France	182.94528198242188
30333 m	51.64945602416992
Valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	63.652191162109375
The young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute	191.3400421142578
Oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not	160.00289916992188
No on my honor said Maximilian but that will not affect you	133.24977111816406
You have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest	127.25171661376953
Valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart	81.25346374511719
Maximilian said she Maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven I entreat you do as I do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be united	54.41923522949219
Adieu Valentine repeated Morrel	152.3877410888672
My God said Valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression I have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter I have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	58.75236129760742
It is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness I am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame	798.3504028320312
Live Maximilian and I will be yours	24.965187072753906
Say when shall it be Speak command I will obey	104.70196533203125
Morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening	32.3040771484375
Valentine said he dear Valentine you must not speak thusrather let me die	521.6030883789062
Why should I obtain you by violence if our love is mutual Is it from mere humanity you bid me live I would then rather die	209.8272247314453
Truly murmured Valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he On whom do my hopes rest On whom does my bleeding heart repose On him on him always on him Yes you are right Maximilian I will follow you	178.90505981445312
I will leave the paternal home I will give up all	55.81479263305664
Oh ungrateful girl that I am cried Valentine sobbing I will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom I had nearly forgotten	318.2841796875
No said Maximilian you shall not leave him	29.904695510864258
Noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me	63.105525970458984
Well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in Gods sight	103.81967163085938
As soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two	45.715396881103516
You have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you I shall very soon learn that language by signs Valentine and I promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us	71.12118530273438
Oh see Maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse mehe is inflexiblehe will never pardon me	50.41189193725586
Now listen to me Maximilian if by artifice by entreaty by accidentin short if by any means I can delay this marriage will you wait	48.35640335083008
Yes I promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse	93.63871765136719
I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother	113.37592315673828
We will wait then said Morrel	33.63642501831055
Yes we will wait replied Valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are	196.72344970703125
I rely on you Valentine said Morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and Madame de SaintMran insist that M	43.60894775390625
dpinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract	79.92881774902344
Then you have my promise Maximilian	125.9175796508789
Instead of signing	244.9073028564453
I will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt Providence let us not see each other	16.456974029541016
It is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	66.68955993652344
If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource	116.06455993652344
You are right Valentine but how shall I ascertain	162.27162170410156
From the notary M	192.21041870117188
I know him	47.211402893066406
And for myselfI will write to you depend on me	170.0654296875
I dread this marriage Maximilian as much as you	1.0691876411437988
Thank you my adored Valentine thank you that is enough	56.96345138549805
When once I know the hour I will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisters there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs	85.7018814086914
Yes said Valentine I will now acknowledge you are right Maximilian and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully	278.1277160644531
My adored Valentine words can not express one half of my satisfaction	91.69789123535156
Valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of Morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier	99.63436889648438
Adieu then till we meet again said Valentine tearing herself away	112.40515899658203
I shall hear from you	100.67931365966797
Thanks thanks dear love adieu	83.16577911376953
The sound of a kiss was heard and Valentine fled through the avenue	196.67982482910156
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	71.2981948852539
The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	245.06021118164062
It was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on M	122.9353256225586
Deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from Valentine although he had not before seen her writing	114.94441986083984
It was to this effect	35.327510833740234
Tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing	190.19570922851562
Yesterday for two hours I was at the church of SaintPhilippeduRoule and for two hours I prayed most fervently	67.50006866455078
Heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock	10.04427719116211
I have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	109.30247497558594
This evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate	75.05892944335938
Your betrothed	116.58679962158203
Valentine de Villefort	98.54678344726562
My poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness	197.57420349121094
You will be very kind to me will you not Morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening	155.82272338867188
Morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening	5.9566264152526855
Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still more	87.29890441894531
Franz had been to announce the ceremony and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of M	137.69029235839844
de SaintMran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	17.29412841796875
The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de SaintMran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	98.66827392578125
It is easy to suppose that Morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating eye	151.5853271484375
Monte Cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him all	61.882381439208984
But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine and kept his secret	148.32388305664062
The young man read Valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day	105.47761535644531
It was her first and on what an occasion Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy	106.10369110107422
How great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution What devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything How ought she really to be supremely loved She becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently	1.1719529628753662
Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say Here I am Maximilian come and help me	136.59857177734375
He had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the cloverfield a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions	333.04864501953125
Occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand	21.991069793701172
When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	42.449424743652344
He shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence	2002.142333984375
At length the hour drew near	100.33100128173828
Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully	142.20364379882812
Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast six	68.20777130126953
He then said It is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps Valentine will not wait for that	93.25924682617188
Consequently Morrel having left the Rue Meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of SaintPhilippeduRoule was striking eight	84.16851043701172
The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where Morrel had often waited	195.15158081054688
The night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue	143.38819885253906
Then Morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	133.0533905029297
The clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while Morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	216.8119354248047
The garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	100.93258666992188
The house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going on	375.14044189453125
Morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast nine	74.17728424072266
This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed	774.157470703125
It was a terrible moment for the young man	49.81071472167969
The slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step	139.06312561035156
Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	142.06552124023438
It is impossible said Maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions	90.12171173095703
I have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened	1.1856809854507446
And then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence	76.93110656738281
Had Valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man	466.6285400390625
The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind	97.54903411865234
In that case said he I should lose her and by my own fault	99.1279296875
He dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	103.44114685058594
He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	132.98501586914062
At last the halfhour struck	118.64897155761719
It was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side	184.41204833984375
He was on Villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the wall	70.54298400878906
What might be the consequences However he had not ventured thus far to draw back	222.1452178955078
He followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees	115.0962905883789
In a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly	73.16477966308594
30341 m	417.33221435546875
Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	79.94303131103516
Instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light	92.77755737304688
A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	50.93653106689453
These three windows were in Madame de SaintMrans room	48.999267578125
Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villeforts bedroom	54.2011833190918
Morrel guessed all this	1.115310788154602
So many times in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all	64.20249938964844
This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentines absence had done	199.2308349609375
Almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flowergarden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him	325.4453125
At this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless	86.53887176513672
He had formed his resolution	116.04253387451172
If it was Valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	84.27115631103516
The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	74.51133728027344
They descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor dAvrigny	114.5630874633789
30339 m	65.09272003173828
The young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain	167.8704071044922
Soon the two gentlemen stopped also	107.10140991210938
Ah my dear doctor said the procureur Heaven declares itself against my house What a dreadful deathwhat a blow Seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrowthe wound is too deep and too fresh Dead dead	455.1592712402344
The cold sweat sprang to the young mans brow and his teeth chattered	179.34194946289062
Who could be dead in that house which Villefort himself had called accursed	84.9579849243164
My dear M	5.630475997924805
de Villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man I have not led you here to console you on the contrary	1009.6050415039062
What can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	1008.8192749023438
I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater	173.3072509765625
Can it be possible murmured Villefort clasping his hands	67.96881103515625
What are you going to tell me	83.2481918334961
Are we quite alone my friend	39.87687683105469
Yes quite but why all these precautions	55.27056121826172
Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	57.53672790527344
Let us sit down	44.24116516113281
Villefort fell rather than seated himself	121.5074234008789
The doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder	136.24795532226562
Morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard	82.27973175048828
Dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying	44.04391860961914
Speak doctorI am listening said Villefort strikeI am prepared for everything	203.48043823242188
Madame de SaintMran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health	155.73818969726562
Morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes	42.6488151550293
Grief has consumed her said Villefortyes grief doctor After living forty years with the marquis	22.692123413085938
It is not grief my dear Villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes	25.168712615966797
Villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	254.5598602294922
Were you present during the last struggle asked M	147.72801208496094
I was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave	840.3729248046875
Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de SaintMran has fallen a victim	202.59158325195312
I did	161.545654296875
Madame de SaintMran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	164.23617553710938
When you arrived Madame de SaintMran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which I took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that I became really alarmed	419.61041259765625
Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought	77.58181762695312
This crisis past I endeavored to catch your eye but could not	73.53650665283203
You held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me	126.85283660888672
This was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple	62.7452507019043
And at the third she expired	40.8613395690918
At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion	196.1138916015625
Yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone	101.81830596923828
What are you going to say Oh spare me	16.320362091064453
That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same	67.45978546142578
de Villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	76.70220947265625
Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake	19.009546279907227
Listen said the doctor I know the full importance of the statement I have just made and the disposition of the man to whom I have made it	47.46293640136719
Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked Villefort	1200.3084716796875
As a friend and only as a friend at this moment	111.99310302734375
The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated I should hesitate I therefore repeat to you I speak not to a magistrate but to a friend	122.19822692871094
And to that friend I say During the threequarters of an hour that the struggle continued I watched the convulsions and the death of Madame de SaintMran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but I could also specify the poison	120.21759033203125
Can it be possible	66.17518615722656
The symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres	88.93399810791016
Madame de SaintMran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her	76.48395538330078
Villefort seized the doctors hand	194.11434936523438
Oh it is impossible said he I must be dreaming It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you Tell me I entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived	141.3644256591797
Doubtless I may but	152.78631591796875
30345 m	65.91106414794922
But I do not think so	85.78443145751953
Have pity on me doctor So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness	154.4051971435547
Has anyone besides me seen Madame de SaintMran	30.554014205932617
Has anything been sent for from a chemists that I have not examined	250.9332733154297
Had Madame de SaintMran any enemies	77.67269897460938
Not to my knowledge	37.637611389160156
Would her death affect anyones interest	326.17938232421875
It could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressValentine alone	114.13717651367188
Oh if such a thought could present itself I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it	171.26112365722656
Indeed my dear friend said M	177.79812622070312
dAvrigny I would not accuse anyone I speak only of an accident you understandof a mistakebut whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you	143.83660888671875
Make inquiry	90.77684783935547
Of whomhowof what	59.270362854003906
May not Barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given Madame de SaintMran a dose prepared for his master	410.4219055175781
For my father	150.88294982910156
But how could a dose prepared for M	72.7488784790039
Noirtier poison Madame de SaintMran	61.97324752807617
Nothing is more simple	14.617874145507812
You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one	163.62139892578125
For instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to M	261.1802673339844
Noirtier I resolved to try one last means and for three months I have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains	98.74141693115234
This quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of M	122.7807846069336
Noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person	56.570499420166016
My dear doctor there is no communication between M	55.54056930541992
Noirtiers apartment and that of Madame de SaintMran and Barrois never entered my motherinlaws room	81.84468078613281
In short doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although I place the utmost reliance in you I want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est	1.1329056024551392
Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself	22.956287384033203
Why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish	104.63038635253906
Send for him I will tell him what I have seen and we will consult together and examine the body	125.98310089111328
And you will find traces of poison	91.92366027832031
No I did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say Dear Villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies	72.41755676269531
What do you propose to me dAvrigny said Villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my houseimpossible Still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish itif you demand it why then it shall be done	88.30728149414062
But doctor you see me already so grievedhow can I introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow My wife and my daughter would die of it And I doctoryou know a man does not arrive at the post I occupyone has not been kings attorney twentyfive years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies mine are numerous	22.51751708984375
Let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame	1314.8138427734375
Pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest I should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind	147.71315002441406
Doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you	77.70470428466797
My dear M	251.637939453125
de Villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity	102.8701171875
I would have saved Madame de SaintMran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living	105.52027893066406
Let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts I am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance	44.08351516723633
Meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here	4.33699369430542
And when you have found the culprit if you find him I will say to you You are a magistrate do as you will	17.3759708404541
I thank you doctor said Villefort with indescribable joy I never had a better friend than you	628.6513061523438
And as if he feared Doctor dAvrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house	36.69788360595703
When they were gone Morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost	102.34274291992188
I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but Valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow	33.875335693359375
As he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	59.652626037597656
The light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	32.89126205444336
At the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open	130.45693969726562
A waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	65.26210021972656
Morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	21.452821731567383
It can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts	96.21672058105469
Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so	522.4890747070312
This double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hidingplace and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming Valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flowergarden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orangetrees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance	140.16537475585938
Valentine had not seen him	12.715190887451172
Her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven	25.070127487182617
Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	405.4715270996094
Meanwhile Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M	93.6855697631836
de Villefort even would not have alarmed him	107.34774780273438
He was quite prepared for any such encounter	510.2340393066406
He would at once approach Valentines father and acknowledge all begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts	104.23728942871094
Morrel was mad	65.16594696044922
Happily he did not meet anyone	219.19300842285156
Now especially did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	97.50871276855469
He turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	209.29969787597656
He pushed the door open and entered	84.466796875
At the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	47.009666442871094
By its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair was Valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff	28.30971908569336
She had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance	45.53413009643555
The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene	31.890705108642578
Morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but Valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	301.1081237792969
He sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a Magdalen by Correggiowas raised and turned towards him	200.35279846191406
Valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise	1773.1790771484375
A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions	32.1645393371582
Morrel held out his hand to her	75.33850860595703
Valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again	162.4691925048828
Neither dared for some time to speak in that room	218.38717651367188
They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length Valentine ventured	55.59358596801758
My friend said she how came you here Alas I would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house	73.4776611328125
Valentine said Morrel with a trembling voice I had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come I became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event	130.46913146972656
What voices asked Valentine	66.7209243774414
Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and M	54.60077667236328
de Villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	22.126052856445312
Your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them I learned it all	86.52843475341797
But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love	141.29461669921875
Forgive me replied Morrel I will go away	19.464496612548828
No said Valentine you might meet someone stay	59.23767852783203
But if anyone should come here	116.33445739746094
The young girl shook her head	104.26502227783203
No one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed	78.71248626708984
But what has become of M	44.198055267333984
dpinay replied Morrel	164.71096801757812
30349 m	65.46098327636719
Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying	40.20864486694336
Alas said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	48.123802185058594
But what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her deathbed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me	168.46749877929688
Hark said Morrel	121.52568054199219
They both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs	32.54021453857422
It is my father who has just left his study	60.1550407409668
To accompany the doctor to the door added Morrel	67.13189697265625
How do you know it is the doctor asked Valentine astonished	76.06892395019531
I imagined it must be said Morrel	173.4200897216797
Valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then M	21.34796714782715
de Villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs	104.7566909790039
He stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de SaintMrans Morrel concealed himself behind a door Valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear	36.33592987060547
de Villefort passed on to his own room	135.48497009277344
Now said Valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden	81.4922866821289
Morrel looked at her with astonishment	340.76416015625
There is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers room	105.87075805664062
She rose	143.52610778808594
Come she added	216.17465209960938
Where asked Maximilian	5.108340740203857
To my grandfathers room	26.43515396118164
I in M	40.26029968261719
Noirtiers apartment	39.442935943603516
Can you mean it Valentine	33.25543212890625
I have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his helpcome	285.00775146484375
Be careful Valentine said Morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes I now see my errorI acted like a madman in coming in here	362.7759704589844
Are you sure you are more reasonable	59.0306510925293
Yes said Valentine and I have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which I had undertaken to watch	26.42679786682129
Valentine said Morrel death is in itself sacred	78.05441284179688
Yes said Valentine besides it will not be for long	24.548194885253906
She then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to M	122.79190063476562
Noirtiers room Morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant	10531.9814453125
Barrois said Valentine shut the door and let no one come in	202.47415161132812
She passed first	21.742345809936523
Noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw Valentine and his eye brightened	106.123779296875
There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate	2333.469970703125
Dear grandfather	102.67542266845703
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now I have no friend in the world but you	29.125873565673828
His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness	147.5712127685547
To you alone then may I confide my sorrows and my hopes	65.24828338623047
The paralytic motioned Yes	100.00157928466797
Valentine took Maximilians hand	21.55318832397461
Look attentively then at this gentleman	82.06594848632812
The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel	141.79351806640625
It is M	97.95418548583984
Maximilian Morrel said she the son of that good merchant of Marseilles whom you doubtless recollect	156.46018981933594
Yes said the old man	4473.19873046875
He brings an irreproachable name which Maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the Legion of Honor	48.481346130371094
The old man signified that he recollected him	10.471565246582031
Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling before him and pointing to Maximilian I love him and will be only his were I compelled to marry another I would destroy myself	266.7859802246094
The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts	97.98114013671875
You like M	80.87866973876953
Maximilian Morrel do you not grandpapa asked Valentine	11.291226387023926
And you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father	10.578337669372559
Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel as if to say perhaps I may	41.07316970825195
Maximilian understood him	82.53884887695312
Mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with M	162.60623168945312
That is it said the old mans eye	79.48129272460938
Then he looked anxiously at Valentine	63.61887741088867
Do you fear he will not understand	23.302480697631836
Oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how I talk to you	47.357078552246094
Then turning to Maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowHe knows everything I know said she	33.20487594604492
Valentine arose placed a chair for Morrel requested Barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel she went away	247.76583862304688
To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentines confidence and knew all their secrets Morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light	235.41041564941406
But first said Morrel allow me sir to tell you who I am how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine and what are my designs respecting her	623.2302856445312
Noirtier made a sign that he would listen	25.30503273010254
It was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong	35.980506896972656
His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel who began his story with trembling	17.93017578125
He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine and how he had loved her and that Valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion	32.62666320800781
He told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered That is good proceed	148.56610107421875
And now said Morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now I have told you of my love and my hopes may I inform you of my intentions	59.44746398925781
Yes signified the old man	148.89389038085938
This was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully M	54.835105895996094
de Villeforts pardon	71.10205841064453
No said Noirtier	854.5700073242188
We must not do so	58.61384963989258
You do not sanction our project	55.25390625
There is another way said Morrel	138.0167236328125
The old mans interrogative eye said Which	93.60920715332031
I will go continued Maximilian I will seek M	25.219675064086914
Franz dpinayI am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me	92.89437866210938
Noirtiers look continued to interrogate	49.918792724609375
You wish to know what I will do	101.46014404296875
I will find him as I told you	220.79315185546875
I will tell him the ties which bind me to Mademoiselle Valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that Valentine loves me and will have no other I will fight with him give him every advantage and I shall kill him or he will kill me if I am victorious he will not marry Valentine and if I die I am very sure Valentine will not marry him	58.88524627685547
Noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing	42.142616271972656
Still when Morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying No	87.93347930908203
No said Morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first	64.77507019042969
I do signified the old man	21.92751693725586
But what then must be done asked Morrel	17.92979621887207
Madame de SaintMrans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must I let things take their course Noirtier did not move	348.441162109375
I understand said Morrel I am to wait	96.03914642333984
But delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man	196.76097106933594
Alone Valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit	100.63400268554688
I am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again	43.618045806884766
Believe me there are only the two plans I have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer	75.74063873291016
Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor	68.57454681396484
Do you prefer I should seek M	58.88426208496094
Whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed Morrel	180.46255493164062
From you	299.0208435058594
You thoroughly understand me sir Pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer	66.99826049804688
Will our help come from you	73.6842041015625
You are sure of it	44.96178436279297
There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power	174.18276977539062
Oh thank you a thousand times But how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage A smile lit up the old mans face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face	101.7496337890625
Then I must wait asked the young man	63.2581787109375
But the contract The same smile returned	30.72965431213379
Will you assure me it shall not be signed	70.94285583496094
Yes said Noirtier	77.60713195800781
The contract shall not be signed cried Morrel	1.8670234680175781
Oh pardon me sir I can scarcely realize so great a happiness	25.44945526123047
Will they not sign it	104.28008270263672
No said the paralytic	87.7634048461914
Notwithstanding that assurance Morrel still hesitated	88.25836944580078
This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	500.87774658203125
Is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power The weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself Jupiter	14.986909866333008
Whether Noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	56.90342712402344
What do you wish sir asked Morrel that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil Noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands	140.38021850585938
Shall I swear to you sir asked Maximilian	111.03824615478516
Yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity	108.75129699707031
Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath	635.5247802734375
He extended his hand	112.85472869873047
I swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M	70.02278900146484
That is right said the old man	66.88944244384766
Now said Morrel do you wish me to retire	118.00761413574219
Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine	99.0785903930664
Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey	139.26797485351562
But said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now	40.66567611694336
Noirtiers expression could not be understood	122.91568756103516
The young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where Valentines had been	126.7094955444336
Then he bowed a second time and retired	3175.223388671875
He found outside the door the old servant to whom Valentine had given directions	56.82498550415039
Morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the cloverfield where his cabriolet was still waiting for him	14.765743255615234
He got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	53.46855926513672

Chapter 74	60.83560562133789
The Villefort Family Vault	50.67411804199219
Two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of M	47.77193832397461
de Villeforts house and a long file of mourningcoaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg SaintHonor and the Rue de la Ppinire	70.46778106689453
Among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance	47.710426330566406
It was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive	162.12945556640625
Inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de SaintMran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two	1.2823946475982666
Their number was great	55.70086669921875
The Marquis de SaintMran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII	33.10663986206055
and King Charles X	19.948040008544922
had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on formed a considerable body	14.184961318969727
Due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time	49.380889892578125
A second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to M	66.91072082519531
de Villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the postwagon	20.94219398498535
The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PreLachaise where M	44.22423553466797
de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	74.30331420898438
The remains of poor Rene were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her	102.74095153808594
The Parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles	454.24822998046875
In one of the mourningcoaches Beauchamp Debray and ChteauRenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness	26.942481994628906
I saw Madame de SaintMran only last year at Marseilles when I was coming back from Algiers said ChteauRenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	81.2869873046875
How old was she	28.46323585510254
Franz assured me replied Albert that she was sixtysix years old	42.03684997558594
But she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason	129.34010314941406
But of what disease then did she die asked Debray	47.74684143066406
It is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not	58.339752197265625
It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said Beauchamp	88.56121826171875
Madame de SaintMran whom I once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de SaintMran	127.57486724853516
At any rate said Albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her M	39.799110412597656
de Villefort or rather Mademoiselle Valentineor still rather our friend Franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting I believe to 80000 livres per annum	20.050457000732422
And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin Noirtier	70.62012481689453
That is a tenacious old grandfather said Beauchamp	83.26493835449219
Tenacem propositi virum	90.65762329101562
I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	84.70807647705078
He resembles the old Conventionalist of 93 who said to Napoleon in 1814 You bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth	215.6299591064453
Take the Republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battlefield and I promise you 500000 soldiers another Marengo and a second Austerlitz	37.30304718017578
Ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely	30.04991912841797
Ideas and men appeared the same to him said Albert	231.93727111816406
One thing only puzzles me namely how Franz dpinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife	66.53243255615234
But where is Franz	32.548927307128906
In the first carriage with M	93.41256713867188
de Villefort who considers him already as one of the family	33.429256439208984
40024 m	71.55919647216797
Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which M	21.103511810302734
dAvrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to M	151.73712158203125
de Villefort	57.100406646728516
They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony	80.67598724365234
Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ChteauRenaud recognized Morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewtrees	105.93742370605469
You here said ChteauRenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of Villeforts How is it that I have never met you at his house	96.97270202636719
I am no acquaintance of M	1689.2987060546875
de Villeforts answered Morrel but I was of Madame de SaintMran	579.6974487304688
Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz	299.0444030761719
The time and place are but illsuited for an introduction	105.25921630859375
said Albert but we are not superstitious	95.41543579101562
Morrel allow me to present to you M	105.34663391113281
Franz dpinay a delightful travelling companion with whom I made the tour of Italy	34.02249526977539
My dear Franz M	220.29122924804688
Maximilian Morrel an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection wit or amiability	43.943946838378906
Morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz	147.0211181640625
Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said Debray to Franz	26.661880493164062
Extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning I scarcely knew her	121.6659927368164
These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart	123.21315002441406
This man had seen Valentine and spoken to her The young and highspirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	128.01177978515625
He took the arm of ChteauRenaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins	256.40313720703125
This is a magnificent habitation said Beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace	105.64241790771484
You will in turn enter it my dear dpinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family	62.66204071044922
I as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	101.96600341796875
In dying I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron Eo rus and all will be over	46.39942169189453
But come Franz take courage your wife is an heiress	70.16473388671875
Indeed Beauchamp you are unbearable	58.31858825683594
Politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	213.6224365234375
But when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber	1.2059321403503418
But tell me said Beauchamp what is life Is it not a halt in Deaths anteroom	55.82640075683594
40026 m	56.86027526855469
I am prejudiced against Beauchamp said Albert drawing Franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with Debray	76.39071655273438
The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door	16.238473892211914
Here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomylooking room separated by a wall from the vault itself	73.79130554199219
The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the Villefort and SaintMran coffins	50.256614685058594
There grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit PreLachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous	126.21321868896484
The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the righthand crypt belonging to the SaintMran family	108.7646255493164
Villefort Franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	108.51374053955078
As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated ChteauRenaud Albert and Morrel went one way and Debray and Beauchamp the other	277.6896057128906
Franz remained with M	1015.3971557617188
de Villefort at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait he saw Franz and M	114.05366516113281
de Villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded evil	164.68568420410156
He then returned to Paris and although in the same carriage with ChteauRenaud and Albert he did not hear one word of their conversation	140.33468627929688
As Franz was about to take leave of M	128.25599670410156
de Villefort When shall I see you again said the latter	26.592498779296875
At what time you please sir replied Franz	463.0643310546875
As soon as possible	53.05302047729492
I am at your command sir shall we return together	37.570556640625
If not unpleasant to you	155.96551513671875
On the contrary I shall feel much pleasure	69.9609146118164
Thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and Morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	59.657630920410156
Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg SaintHonor	269.2092590332031
The procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair	42.1240234375
dpinay said he allow me to remind you at this momentwhich is perhaps not so illchosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomballow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de SaintMran on her deathbed that Valentines wedding might not be deferred	359.3310241699219
You know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire property of the SaintMran family the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately	1.1617149114608765
You may call on the notary M	193.1184539794922
Deschamps Place Beauveau Faubourg SaintHonor and you have my authority to inspect those deeds	120.18468475341797
Sir replied M	90.17561340332031
dpinay it is not perhaps the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed I fear	129.9472198486328
40028 m	183.67059326171875
Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter I assure you	64.85523986816406
In that case replied Franz as I shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please I have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it	162.83364868164062
Then said Villefort nothing further is required	200.7885284423828
The contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready and can sign it today	248.0248260498047
But the mourning said Franz hesitating	595.1409301757812
Do nt be uneasy on that score replied Villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house	144.48248291015625
Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of SaintMran I say hers for she inherits it today	80.22293853759766
There after a few days if you like the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony	56.519378662109375
Madame de SaintMran wished her daughter should be married there	52.490318298339844
When that is over you sir can return to Paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her motherinlaw	242.5198516845703
As you please sir said Franz	91.46360778808594
Then replied M	24.963199615478516
de Villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour Valentine shall come down into the drawingroom	135.2942657470703
I will send for M	38.55937576293945
Deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week	47.65462875366211
Sir said Franz I have one request to make	74.02182006835938
What is it	88.61854553222656
I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de ChteauRenaud to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses	175.9547882080078
Half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send	92.99138641357422
I prefer going sir	297.3177185058594
I shall expect you then in half an hour baron and Valentine will be ready	159.08041381835938
Franz bowed and left the room	226.30282592773438
Scarcely had the door closed when M	207.5962677001953
de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and M	54.073631286621094
dpinay and his witnesses	72.47593688964844
The news caused a great sensation throughout the house Madame de Villefort would not believe it and Valentine was thunderstruck	112.90812683105469
She looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met M	103.9583740234375
de Villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	170.28297424316406
In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant	107.71092987060547
A moment later Madame de Villefort entered the drawingroom with her little Edward	142.45509338378906
It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	159.3930206298828
She sat down took Edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom	105.5526351928711
Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard	142.70433044433594
One was the notarys the other that of Franz and his friends	66.90385437011719
In a moment the whole party was assembled	224.06182861328125
Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	61.308189392089844
Franz was deeply affected	73.11831665039062
ChteauRenaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin	97.45828247070312
Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	283.1118469238281
de Villefort was as usual unmoved	199.09759521484375
The notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards Franz	139.28948974609375
Are you M	59.30641174316406
Franz de Quesnel baron dpinay asked he although he knew it perfectly	46.013309478759766
Yes sir replied Franz	30.401208877563477
The notary bowed	22.91569709777832
I have then to inform you sir at the request of M	152.8373260498047
de Villefort that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M	47.457096099853516
Noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her	50.67142105102539
Let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void	75.15354919433594
said Villefort but I warn M	226.418212890625
dpinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained	68.04713439941406
40032 m	188.00550842285156
Sir said Franz I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine I have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine	71.26600646972656
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M	82.09162139892578
de Villefort all I seek is happiness	98.11339569091797
Valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks	81.7323989868164
Besides sir said Villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you M	34.16138458251953
Noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains it	187.62855529785156
It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow	114.88321685791016
Old age is selfish sir and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M	169.0522003173828
Noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the Baroness dpinay	48.106204986572266
My fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married M	15.928544044494629
Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson	1.0184961557388306
de Villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and Barrois appeared	63.32870864868164
Gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstancesgentlemen M	131.73484802246094
Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M	61.21853256225586
Franz de Quesnel baron dpinay	328.5408020019531
He as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect	74.37551879882812
Villefort started Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees Valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue	84.58392333984375
Albert and ChteauRenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first	187.01150512695312
The notary looked at Villefort	31.154014587402344
It is impossible said the procureur	91.7458267211914
dpinay can not leave the drawingroom at present	217.7516326904297
It is at this moment replied Barrois with the same firmness that M	165.72064208984375
Noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to M	72.18295288085938
Franz dpinay	118.57425689697266
Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now then said Edward with his habitual quickness	124.52591705322266
However his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation	150.19338989257812
Tell M	377.96246337890625
Nortier resumed Villefort that what he demands is impossible	50.024864196777344
Then M	59.2706184387207
Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied Barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawingroom	17.167081832885742
Astonishment was at its height	12.250116348266602
Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villeforts countenance	753.2540893554688
Valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven	179.10702514648438
Pray go Valentine said M	127.62659454345703
de Villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers is	18.611040115356445
Valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when M	212.55191040039062
de Villefort altered his intention	72.19361877441406
Stop said he I will go with you	224.656005859375
Excuse me sir said Franz since M	66.56108856201172
Noirtier sent for me I am ready to attend to his wish besides I shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so	36.2465934753418
Pray sir said Villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself	47.934059143066406
40032 m	95.50333404541016
Forgive me sir said Franz in a resolute tone	1.0159815549850464
I would not lose this opportunity of proving to M	101.46875762939453
Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which I am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion	147.09060668945312
And without listening to Villefort he arose and followed Valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to	78.78491973876953
de Villefort followed them	66.92868041992188
ChteauRenaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder	49.118717193603516
Chapter 75	61.79245376586914
A Signed Statement	44.238548278808594
Noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair	25.20677375793457
When the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed	75.22830200195312
Listen whispered Villefort to Valentine who could not conceal her joy if M	135.98716735839844
Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage I forbid you to understand him	95.24856567382812
Valentine blushed but did not answer	196.72381591796875
Villefort approached Noirtier	100.96218872070312
Here is M	207.15997314453125
Franz dpinay said he you requested to see him	92.90988159179688
We have all wished for this interview and I trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to Valentines marriage	54.945796966552734
Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villeforts blood run cold	77.39725494384766
He motioned to Valentine to approach	386.18939208984375
In a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key	67.73350524902344
Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	106.98396301269531
She opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents	51.7264404296875
Shall I open the secretaire asked Valentine	158.82044982910156
Yes said the old man	83.20001220703125
And the drawers	179.30799865722656
Those at the side	290.7823486328125
The middle one	94.5979995727539
Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	58.82300567626953
Is that what you wish for asked she	72.26974487304688
She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	260.9953918457031
But there are no more said she	334.99578857421875
Noirtiers eye was fixed on the dictionary	154.62644958496094
Yes I understand grandfather said the young girl	145.9691162109375
40036 m	172.07151794433594
She pointed to each letter of the alphabet	68.97128295898438
At the letter S the old man stopped her	417.7901916503906
She opened and found the word secret	144.66323852539062
Ah is there a secret spring said Valentine	165.48452758789062
Yes said Noirtier	39.15372085571289
And who knows it Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	93.08096313476562
Barrois said she	78.64949798583984
Shall I call him	9.885436058044434
Valentine went to the door and called Barrois	42.150978088378906
Villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and Franz was stupefied	145.43692016601562
The old servant came	96.1052474975586
Barrois said Valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it	159.0211181640625
Barrois looked at the old man	86.03579711914062
Obey said Noirtiers intelligent eye	37.11762619018555
Barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string	119.3394546508789
Is that what you wish for said Barrois	168.64320373535156
Shall I give these papers to M	46.611915588378906
de Villefort	1.1151525974273682
To Mademoiselle Valentine	137.2802276611328
To M	23.94878578186035
Franz dpinay	99.93321990966797
Franz astonished advanced a step	33.51974105834961
To me sir said he	74.73643493652344
Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover read	65.6384506225586
To be given after my death to General Durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document	3364.512939453125
Well sir asked Franz what do you wish me to do with this paper	84.6976089477539
To preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur	148.21563720703125
No replied Noirtier eagerly	124.89295196533203
Do you wish him to read it said Valentine	65.79095458984375
Yes replied the old man	72.29948425292969
You understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said Valentine	135.98788452148438
Then let us sit down said Villefort impatiently for it will take some time	840.3729248046875
Sit down said the old man	86.09444427490234
Villefort took a chair but Valentine remained standing by her fathers side and Franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand	69.4407730102539
Read said the old man	39.16929626464844
Franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read	73.2389907836914
40038 m	152.6228485107422
Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the Rue SaintJacques held February 5th 1815	391.0604248046875
Franz stopped	75.16494750976562
February 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was murdered	243.07281494140625
Valentine and Villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly Go on	39.562774658203125
But it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared	136.400390625
Noirtiers eye continued to say Read	153.7882080078125
He resumed	553.7505493164062
The undersigned LouisJacques Beaurepaire lieutenantcolonel of artillery tienne Duchampy general of brigade and Claude Lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the 4th of February a letter arrived from the Island of Elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the Bonapartist Club General Flavien de Quesnel who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which Louis XVIII	86.4736557006836
had just granted to him with his estate of pinay	84.3426742553711
400340 m	430.664794921875
A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th	70.94583129882812
The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	107.09564208984375
The meetings were always held from that time till midnight	189.6507110595703
At nine oclock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage	249.02371215820312
General de Quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took	373.1334228515625
The generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went	62.31859588623047
What must be done then asked the general	180.26483154296875
I have my carriage here said the president	53.50574493408203
Have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know	185.60838317871094
Our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a StateCouncillor	1.0454856157302856
Then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset	1581.06103515625
We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly	214.19566345214844
When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition	56.7223014831543
On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath	61.69953155517578
Sure enough said the general	240.4632568359375
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue SaintJacques	34.608863830566406
The general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assemblyroom	341.2147216796875
The deliberations had already begun	118.9913558959961
The members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	299.38653564453125
When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant	92.3031997680664
They questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to have informed them	220.17886352539062
Franz interrupted himself by saying My father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known	65.60847473144531
And hence said Villefort arose my affection for your father my dear M	45.10126876831055
Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union	52.55747985839844
Read again said the old man	70.36395263671875
Franz continued	56.987308502197266
The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but M	112.84170532226562
de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him	59.98870086669922
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party	52.467159271240234
One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel of Marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor	26.53338623046875
During all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance	283.3125305175781
When the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows	33.83799362182617
Well asked the president what do you say to this letter general	90.00991821289062
I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII	104.29878234863281
to break my vow in behalf of the exemperor	169.4732666015625
This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	377.5013732910156
General said the president we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII	44.79023742675781
or an exemperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from France which is his kingdom by violence and treason	82.13077545166016
Excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge Louis XVIII	45.38983154296875
but I do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to France	28.237241744995117
Sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba and have deceived us The communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you honor	55.679195404052734
Now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn	131.6976776123047
We will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so	60.89580154418945
You would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what I should call becoming your accomplice	61.957645416259766
You see I am more candid than you	112.53392791748047
Ah my father said Franz interrupting himself	82.22003936767578
I understand now why they murdered him	66.1162338256836
Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold	17.361759185791016
Villefort walked to and fro behind them	69.7099609375
Noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	79.98188781738281
Franz returned to the manuscript and continued	41.74478530883789
Sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted	124.53732299804688
When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII	1.543758511543274
or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police	109.40843200683594
It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	152.14791870117188
No no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor	31.691749572753906
I am a royalist replied the general I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XVIII	35.58866882324219
and I will adhere to it	34.12254333496094
These words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness	92.29914855957031
The president again arose and having imposed silence saidSir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you	19.449180603027344
The general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedIf you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence	40.95563507080078
And you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger I advise you not to touch your sword	98.29621124267578
The general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidI will not swear	66.51473236083984
Then you must die replied the president calmly	104.25359344482422
dpinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks	13.449481964111328
General said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us	123.66996765136719
A significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyClose the doors said the president to the doorkeeper	51.87770080566406
40042 m	1690.2664794921875
The same deadly silence succeeded these words	109.86576843261719
Then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsI have a son said he and I ought to think of him finding myself among assassins	82.92853546142578
General said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of weakness	51.7564811706543
But he does wrong to use his privilege	23.021167755126953
Follow my advice swear and do not insult	145.68069458007812
The general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskWhat is the form said he	94.2522964477539
It is thisI swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this oath	65.71163177490234
The general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did	113.75580596923828
Now am I at liberty to retire said the general	29.073026657104492
The president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes	113.13700866699219
One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	58.657997131347656
The other members silently dispersed	83.05865478515625
Where do you wish to be taken asked the president	91.4763412475586
Anywhere out of your presence replied M	69.40850067138672
Beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible	7.537482261657715
But instead of listening M	40.01681137084961
dpinay went onYou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one	30.048307418823242
The president stopped the coach	29.66575050354004
They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the river	70.53020477294922
Why do you stop here asked dpinay	101.21907043457031
Because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation	144.95545959472656
Another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders	167.89730834960938
Make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield	24.452322006225586
You are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side I have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you	43.812225341796875
Now if you please remove your bandage	113.07342529296875
The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes	146.1766815185547
At last said he I shall know with whom I have to do	92.12200164794922
They opened the door and the four men alighted	119.49706268310547
Franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a mystery	69.2617416381836
Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	50.19476318359375
Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride	75.98905181884766
Franz continued	81.18546295166016
It was as we said the fifth of February	114.91718292236328
For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice	31.55449867248535
The general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down	180.09170532226562
The two witnesses followed	258.9356689453125
It was a dark night	76.6733627319336
The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep	277.8211364746094
One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coalbarge near and by its light they examined the weapons	108.934814453125
The presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	75.64791107177734
The general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms	95.1443862915039
The witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent	28.51617431640625
The lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began	127.76304626464844
The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great	204.01234436035156
40044 m	131.69679260253906
General dpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	34.37222671508789
The witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise	59.39037322998047
The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary	440.3812255859375
But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	84.6976089477539
He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge	194.34228515625
At the third he fell again	27.017974853515625
They thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood	64.37797546386719
The general who had almost fainted revived	52.430728912353516
Ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with me	9.224788665771484
The president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound	16.725055694580078
Still he had not even uttered a sigh	79.379638671875
General dpinay died five minutes after	20.896223068237305
Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moments silence he continued	39.924530029296875
The president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course	379.9344177246094
He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead	73.81731414794922
The general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported	51.94650650024414
In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor	23.654993057250977
Signed Beaurepaire Duchampy and Lecharpal	94.77711486816406
When Franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when Valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when Villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man	24.790992736816406
Sir said dpinay to Noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signaturessince you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfactiontell me the name of the president of the club that I may at least know who killed my father	42.79108428955078
Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door Valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps	55.58613586425781
Mademoiselle said Franz turning towards Valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age	65.81214141845703
Valentine remained dumb and motionless	51.34212875366211
Hold sir said Villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene	24.269805908203125
The names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you proper names are not in the dictionary	42.184776306152344
Oh misery cried Franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father Sir sir cried he turning to Noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way	138.5679473876953
Yes replied Noirtier	50.07585144042969
Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried Franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	139.16952514648438
Help melend me your assistance	125.17937469482422
Noirtier looked at the dictionary	265.4434509277344
Franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to M	1096.18359375
At that letter the old man signified Yes	92.09217071533203
M repeated Franz	197.3425750732422
The young mans finger glided over the words but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign	16.611873626708984
Valentine hid her head between her hands	15.487908363342285
At length Franz arrived at the word MYSELF	40.04146194458008
40046 m	83.00849151611328
You cried Franz whose hair stood on end you M	109.06448364257812
Noirtieryou killed my father	36.9220085144043
Yes replied Noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man	65.85157012939453
Franz fell powerless on a chair Villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man	71.92708587646484
Chapter 76	76.36734008789062
Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger	1.2480175495147705
Meanwhile M	215.79957580566406
Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria but at the gamingtable of the baths of Lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers	85.0773696899414
He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father	212.75572204589844
Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsinari	22.830211639404297
He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered	127.86207580566406
Besides what is required of a young man in Paris To speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash	96.85929107666016
They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman	141.08071899414062
Andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position	61.60595703125
He was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of Saravezza were a constant theme	4.629002094268799
A learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality	133.38536071777344
Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M	62.803558349609375
Danglars a visit	178.5810089111328
Danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	19.51156997680664
It was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at Auteuil and the events which followed it that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristos name announced	215.4797821044922
If he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear	72.45067596435547
It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every mind	44.11472702026367
40048 m	33.79283905029297
When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M	25.055185317993164
Cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name	176.7027587890625
The latter took in the whole scene at a glance	592.5135498046875
The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa Eugnie sat near her and Cavalcanti was standing	198.19508361816406
Cavalcanti dressed in black like one of Goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of Monte Cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	93.22865295410156
This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	4.234422206878662
Mademoiselle Danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	16.518653869628906
Not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho	73.70581817626953
Eugnie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M	48.125465393066406
Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly her singing teacher	92.73995971679688
It was then especially while conversing with Madame Danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed M	64.94926452636719
Andrea Cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration	48.4420051574707
The banker soon returned	34.45111083984375
His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo but the second was for Andrea	57.65553665161133
As for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life	27.719276428222656
Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said Danglars to Andrea	104.33364868164062
Alas no sir replied Andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones	69.96759033203125
Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it	13.870150566101074
40050 m	1.1692103147506714
The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably	37.97380447387695
Mademoiselle dArmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with Eugnie one of the tableaux vivants of which the Germans are so fond	322.41845703125
She was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	94.43218994140625
She was said to have a weak chest and like Antonia in the Cremona Violin she would die one day while singing	180.50772094726562
Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dArmilly of whom he had heard much	58.42599868774414
Well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded	22.355514526367188
He then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manuvre the door was partially closed after Andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied Andrea Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice of it	65.52677917480469
The count soon heard Andreas voice singing a Corsican song accompanied by the piano	39.10849380493164
While the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husbands strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at Milan	31.64515495300293
The praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect it	181.2460174560547
Hem thought Monte Cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them	68.93002319335938
Then aloudOh madame M	164.33111572265625
Danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses elsewhere	33.66524887084961
I see that you participate in a prevalent error said Madame Danglars	112.7310791015625
What is it said Monte Cristo	301.2596740722656
That M	165.68191528320312
Danglars speculates whereas he never does	98.4892807006836
Truly madame I recollect M	80.01980590820312
Debray told meapropos what has become of him I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days	176.47195434570312
Nor I said Madame Danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish	50.17333221435547
Debray had told you	89.74027252197266
Ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation	99.18097686767578
I was once very fond of it but I do not indulge now	92.8909683227539
Then you are wrong madame	140.2792205810547
Fortune is precarious and if I were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk	79.39224243164062
Well I would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him	246.52549743652344
Madame Danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	80.68821716308594
Stay said Monte Cristo as though he had not observed her confusion I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan bonds	121.35462188720703
I have nonenor have I ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts	71.4789810180664
What has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	68.33407592773438
You know the Marquis of SaintMran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to Paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival	659.2713012695312
Yes said Monte Cristo I have heard that but as Claudius said to Hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them	217.6427459716797
But that is not all	120.40478515625
Not all	34.934234619140625
No they were going to marry their daughter	160.90213012695312
To M	102.31058502197266
Franz dpinay	39.80976486206055
Is it broken off	47.385833740234375
Yesterday morning it appears Franz declined the honor	28.540390014648438
Indeed And is the reason known	181.9680633544922
How extraordinary And how does M	163.8792266845703
de Villefort bear it	60.20273208618164
As usual	89.52835845947266
Like a philosopher	114.44236755371094
Danglars returned at this moment alone	40.547935485839844
Well said the baroness do you leave M	342.39813232421875
Cavalcanti with your daughter	65.68341064453125
And Mademoiselle dArmilly said the banker do you consider her no one Then turning to Monte Cristo he said Prince Cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not But is he really a prince	114.59159851074219
I will not answer for it said Monte Cristo	138.3151092529297
His father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but I do not think he has much claim to that title	38.074798583984375
Why said the banker	309.5047302246094
If he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank I do not like anyone to deny his origin	24.640531539916992
Oh you are a thorough democrat said Monte Cristo smiling	14.319255828857422
But do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	67.369873046875
If perchance M	120.06892395019531
de Morcerf came he would find M	29.281097412109375
Cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of Eugnie has never been admitted	333.30029296875
You may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him	6513.1162109375
But should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased	209.9800567626953
He You are mistaken	67.99076080322266
Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like Eugnie sufficiently	25.02878761291504
Besides I care not for his displeasure	83.62567901611328
Still situated as we are	232.76678466796875
Yes do you know how we are situated At his mothers ball he danced once with Eugnie and M	137.161865234375
Cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it	38.05250930786133
The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf	146.11953735351562
The baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when Danglars stopped her	79.44173431396484
Let her alone said he	26.236162185668945
She looked at him in amazement	93.0622787475586
Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	49.4544563293457
Albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	69.86580657958984
He bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to Danglars and affectionately to Monte Cristo	196.55596923828125
Then turning to the baroness May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is said he	385.5544128417969
She is quite well replied Danglars quickly she is at the piano with M	76.61378479003906
Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew Monte Cristos eye was on him	43.441078186035156
Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and Mademoiselle Eugnie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like Thalberg	45.97977066040039
The concert must be a delightful one	13.76461410522461
They suit each other remarkably well said Danglars	22.668180465698242
Albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that Madame Danglars blushed	202.81138610839844
I too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any	34.59330749511719
Danglars smiled and seemed to say It is of no consequence	85.22199249267578
Then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidThe prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday	63.30428695678711
You were not of the party M	31.77480697631836
de Morcerf	149.306396484375
What prince asked Albert	70.8034439086914
Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	43.10113525390625
Pardon me said Albert I was not aware that he was a prince	85.42305755615234
And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugnie yesterday It must have been charming indeed	508.4794616699219
I regret not having heard them	187.32191467285156
But I was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChteauRenaud	98.81574249267578
This was followed by rather an awkward silence	45.081382751464844
May I also be allowed said Morcerf to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars	337.1231994628906
Wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina Ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finishone moment	15.417047500610352
Bravo bravi brava The banker was enthusiastic in his applause	85.0630111694336
40054 m	245.1361846923828
Indeed said Albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does	741.3047485351562
You said prince did you not But he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in Italy	28.479921340942383
But to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat Danglars without telling them there is a stranger	63.29043197631836
Ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation	305.2936096191406
Danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans indifference	84.89824676513672
He took Monte Cristo aside	41.16292190551758
What do you think of our lover said he	57.53642272949219
He appears cool	33.169189453125
But then your word is given	20.913599014282227
Yes doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not	151.52101135253906
See him there cold as marble and proud like his father	135.9020538330078
If he were rich if he had Cavalcantis fortune that might be pardoned	42.18701171875
Ma foi I have nt consulted my daughter but if she has good taste	80.13653564453125
Oh said Monte Cristo my fondness may blind me but I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good	59.272483825683594
Hem said Danglars	43.96868896484375
Why do you doubt	185.07962036132812
The pastthat obscurity on the past	102.06041717529297
But that does not affect the son	72.1956558227539
Very true	58.251548767089844
Now I beg of you do nt go off your head	48.751136779785156
Its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti whom I do not really know at all	31.75548553466797
But I do	160.1580047607422
Have you made inquiry	24.491809844970703
Is there any need of that Does not his appearance speak for him And he is very rich	21.98387908935547
I am not so sure of that	41.00728988647461
And yet you said he had money	20.9061336517334
Fifty thousand livresa mere trifle	152.81947326660156
He is well educated	23.954713821411133
Hem said Monte Cristo in his turn	100.50730895996094
He is a musician	46.312992095947266
So are all Italians	1719.81689453125
Come count you do not do that young man justice	319.9983215332031
Well I acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the Morcerf family to see him throw himself in the way	26.868328094482422
Danglars burst out laughing	25.238466262817383
What a Puritan you are said he that happens every day	59.11842346191406
But you can not break it off in this way the Morcerfs are depending on this union	96.00164794921875
Then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family	126.55491638183594
Iwhere the devil did you find out that	29.053970336914062
At their ball it was apparent enough	102.95683288574219
Why did not the countess the proud Mercds the disdainful Catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour	25.911054611206055
Ah baron baron said Albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you	43.88514709472656
Oh do nt worry about me Sir Mocker said Danglars then turning to Monte Cristo he said	68.83086395263672
But will you undertake to speak to the father	127.04279327392578
Willingly if you wish it	1.0659080743789673
But let it be done explicitly and positively	44.099910736083984
If he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel	152.7633056640625
You understandno more delay	84.5612564086914
Yes sir I will give my attention to the subject	5.9566264152526855
I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision but I do await it	6.879053592681885
A banker must you know be a slave to his promise	73.89422607421875
And Danglars sighed as M	151.1168670654297
Cavalcanti had done half an hour before	132.4140625
Bravi bravo brava cried Morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end	40.71760177612305
Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him	23.5981502532959
I shall soon return said the banker to Monte Cristo wait for me	39.05555725097656
I shall perhaps have something to say to you	49.358360290527344
And he went out	100.62464904785156
The baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and M	122.30192565917969
Andrea who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugnie started up like a jackinthebox	67.23799896240234
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	139.60107421875
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to Morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible	114.82389831542969
Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening	54.2947998046875
Cavalcanti being left alone turned to Monte Cristo	24.136192321777344
Come said Madame Danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea	29.390228271484375
Come Louise said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend	44.75236892700195
They passed into the next drawingroom where tea was prepared	39.6721076965332
Just as they were beginning in the English fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and Danglars entered visibly agitated	15.01701545715332
Monte Cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	82.22312927246094
I have just received my courier from Greece said Danglars	34.178802490234375
Ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us	44.11637878417969
How is King Otho getting on asked Albert in the most sprightly tone	80.9521255493164
Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	67.85686492919922
We shall go together shall we not said Albert to the count	33.866172790527344
If you like replied the latter	523.9086303710938
Albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to Monte Cristo who understood it perfectlyDid you see said he how he looked at me	44.08247375488281
Yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look	65.62399291992188
Indeed I did and what does he mean by his news from Greece	115.42560577392578
How can I tell you	32.3548583984375
Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country	53.11906433105469
Monte Cristo smiled significantly	29.26900863647461
Stop said Albert here he comes	47.20481872558594
I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you	74.8368148803711
If you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said Monte Cristo	173.03880310058594
No everyone would do that	1.1442437171936035
My dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent	42.66229248046875
Albert advanced towards Eugnie smiling	46.63722610473633
Meanwhile Danglars stooping to Monte Cristos ear Your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina	102.46408081054688
Indeed said Monte Cristo	1935.1326904296875
Yes I will tell you all but take away the young man I can not endure his presence	2411.0439453125
He is going with me	51.4942626953125
Shall I send the father to you	56.23377990722656
Very well	215.02725219726562
The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars contempt Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	46.91877746582031
Cavalcanti remained master of the field	59.973575592041016
Chapter 77	156.8689727783203
Scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when Albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural	250.28187561035156
Well said he I will ask you the same question which Charles IX	76.34786224365234
put to Catherine de Medici after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew How have I played my little part	144.91468811035156
To what do you allude asked Monte Cristo	101.49276733398438
To the installation of my rival at M	95.74800872802734
What rival	17.62100601196289
Ma foi what rival Why your protg M	22.68850326538086
Andrea Cavalcanti	20.86461639404297
Ah no joking viscount if you please I do not patronize M	61.99488067626953
Andreaat least not as concerns M	56.044761657714844
And you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it	54.19964599609375
What do you think he is paying his addresses	150.38401794433594
I am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions	91.82342529296875
He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugnie	70114.4765625
What does that signify so long as they favor your suit	131.39431762695312
But it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	61.592796325683594
I am repulsed on all sides	894.1731567382812
It is so indeed Mademoiselle Eugnie scarcely answers me and Mademoiselle dArmilly her confidant does not speak to me at all	68.36341094970703
But the father has the greatest regard possible for you said Monte Cristo	134.3045196533203
He Oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedyweapons I own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly	80.8932876586914
Jealousy indicates affection	105.86192321777344
True but I am not jealous	84.86930847167969
He is	53.75208282470703
Of whomof Debray	1724.33154296875
No of you	155.8728790283203
Of me I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me	163.1666259765625
You are mistaken my dear viscount	166.2349853515625
Prove it to me	48.11726379394531
Do you wish me to do so	51.1222038269043
Well I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron	82.35643005371094
By whom are you charged	191.2108917236328
By the baron himself	82.41744232177734
Oh said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	44.02204895019531
You surely will not do that my dear count	139.12965393066406
Certainly I shall Albert as I have promised to do it	573.4609375
Well said Albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me	154.2934112548828
I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said Monte Cristo	48.86339569091797
But apropos of Debray how is it that I have not seen him lately at the barons house	35.944881439208984
There has been a misunderstanding	35.50800323486328
What with the baroness	213.89508056640625
No with the baron	124.47089385986328
Has he perceived anything	61.867130279541016
Ah that is a good joke	24.898120880126953
Do you think he suspects said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness	32.718631744384766
Where have you come from my dear count said Albert	143.41773986816406
From Congo if you will	103.95560455322266
It must be farther off than even that	100.02928924560547
But what do I know of your Parisian husbands	211.01309204101562
Oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race	32.58128356933594
But then what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray They seemed to understand each other so well said Monte Cristo with renewed energy	11.408415794372559
Ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis in which I am not initiated	124.35070037841797
When M	69.12590026855469
Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question	285.6745910644531
The carriage stopped	1.554059624671936
Here we are said Monte Cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come in	39.64008712768555
Certainly I will	8.362045288085938
My carriage shall take you back	198.46292114257812
No thank you I gave orders for my coup to follow me	40.298954010009766
There it is then said Monte Cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	7.879579544067383
They both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in there	99.87548065185547
You will make tea for us Baptistin said the count	26.672739028930664
Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales	139.36981201171875
Really my dear count said Morcerf what I admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for Beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness	166.2572479248047
What you say is perhaps true they know my habits	85.01889038085938
For instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime	20.824495315551758
Ma foi I should like to smoke	70.90129089355469
Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once	392.7037048339844
In about the space of a second a private door opened and Ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia	61.92843246459961
It is quite wonderful said Albert	56.4053840637207
Oh no it is as simple as possible replied Monte Cristo	42.2314338684082
Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that I ordered tea and he also knows that I brought you home with me when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneand now the mystery is solved	553.7505493164062
Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youAh but what do I hear and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar	68.29473114013672
Ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars piano to be attacked by Haydes guzla	31.32341957092285
Haydewhat an adorable name Are there then really women who bear the name of Hayde anywhere but in Byrons poems	60.76657485961914
Certainly there are	123.85220336914062
Hayde is a very uncommon name in France but is common enough in Albania and Epirus it is as if you said for example Chastity Modesty Innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you Parisians call it	27.076345443725586
Oh that is charming said Albert how I should like to hear my countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness Mademoiselle Silence Mademoiselle Christian Charity Only think then if Mademoiselle Danglars instead of being called ClaireMarieEugnie had been named Mademoiselle ChastityModestyInnocence Danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage	53.1026496887207
Hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone Hayde may hear you perhaps	116.3827896118164
And you think she would be angry	92.17103576660156
No certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	121.44579315185547
She is very amiable then is she not said Albert	57.852718353271484
It is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master	78.27035522460938
Come you are joking yourself now	310.39788818359375
Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name	84.54125213623047
Really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people	70.81965637207031
The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo Why it is a rank of itself in France and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year	1316.3558349609375
A hundred thousand francs The poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the Thousand and One Nights would seem but poverty	80.92742919921875
She must be a princess then	46.709556579589844
You are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too	134.0646514892578
I thought so	53.050594329833984
But how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave	94.64067840576172
How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster The fortune of war my dear viscountthe caprice of fortune that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for	93.23234558105469
And is her name a secret	80.72408294677734
As regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence I feel I may rely if I consider it necessary to enjoin itmay I not do so	63.41501235961914
Certainly on my word of honor	48.342769622802734
You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina do you not	53.13486862182617
Of Ali Tepelini13 Oh yes it was in his service that my father made his fortune	150.44879150390625
True I had forgotten that	54.54065704345703
40062 m	229.7467041015625
Well what is Hayde to Ali Tepelini	44.28071594238281
Merely his daughter	116.68412017822266
What the daughter of Ali Pasha	13.802379608154297
Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki	29.846920013427734
And your slave	184.83303833007812
Ma foi yes	64.01522827148438
But how did she become so	738.5407104492188
Why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as I was passing through the market at Constantinople	34.71825408935547
Wonderful Really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when I listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream	273.93743896484375
Now I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but	59.38176727294922
Say on	58.824405670166016
But since you go out with Hayde and sometimes even take her to the Opera	174.40809631347656
I think I may venture to ask you this favor	108.33304595947266
You may venture to ask me anything	47.52164840698242
Well then my dear count present me to your princess	37.462284088134766
I will do so but on two conditions	30.644498825073242
I accept them at once	528.037841796875
The first is that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the interview	165.27169799804688
Very well said Albert extending his hand I swear I will not	54.5133171081543
The second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers	108.65824890136719
I give you my oath that I will not	39.56582260131836
Enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not But I know you to be a man of honor	49.51200866699219
The count again struck the gong	168.07907104492188
Ali reappeared	454.6391296386719
Tell Hayde said he that I will take coffee with her and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to her	331.92047119140625
Ali bowed and left the room	137.9324493408203
Now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear Morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and I will ask her	392.6426696777344
Ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on	56.280029296875
Let us go in said Monte Cristo	68.3306884765625
Albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves	106.11213684082031
Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three French attendants commanded by Myrtho	68.01213073730469
Hayde was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawingroom	24.28734588623047
Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except Monte Cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	395.8150329589844
She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her	107.27729034423828
Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress	59.68241500854492
On perceiving Monte Cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love	87.38011932373047
Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	60.958641052246094
40064 m	99.63665008544922
Albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea	40.6986083984375
Whom do you bring asked the young girl in Romaic of Monte Cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy	150.9010772705078
A friend said Monte Cristo in the same language	92.83863067626953
What is his name	88.33562469482422
Count Albert it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at Rome	1.1339812278747559
In what language would you like me to converse with him	164.170166015625
Monte Cristo turned to Albert	66.60261535644531
Do you know modern Greek asked he	101.0243148803711
Alas no said Albert nor even ancient Greek my dear count never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself	71.64297485351562
Then said Hayde proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristos question and Alberts answer then I will speak either in French or Italian if my lord so wills it	314.8185729980469
Monte Cristo reflected one instant	234.62730407714844
You will speak in Italian said he	100.28331756591797
Then turning towards AlbertIt is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek both of which Hayde speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation	69.66796112060547
The count made a sign to Hayde to address his visitor	29.475873947143555
Sir she said to Morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master	96.41549682617188
This was said in excellent Tuscan and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer	145300.515625
Then turning to Ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her	57.757816314697266
Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers	58.19063949584961
Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to M	87.78919219970703
Baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	73.63240051269531
Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him	83.20683288574219
Oh take ittake it said the count Hayde is almost as civilized as a Parisian the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume you know	305.5627136230469
Ali left the room	119.62014770507812
The cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for Albert	60.20945358276367
Monte Cristo and Hayde took the beverage in the original Arabian manner that is to say without sugar	67.86324310302734
Hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes	152.81044006347656
At this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose	490.602783203125
My dear host and you signora said Albert in Italian excuse my apparent stupidity	94.30988311767578
I am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so	117.85487365722656
Here I am in the heart of Paris but a moment ago I heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to the East not such as I have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	243.6071319580078
Oh signora if I could but speak Greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget	217.32447814941406
I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you sir said Hayde quietly and if you like what is Eastern I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here	62.41691207885742
On what subject shall I converse with her said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo	27.58060073852539
Just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of Rome Naples or Florence	286.20306396484375
Oh said Albert it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian let me speak to her of the East	168.3030548095703
Do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste	106.98712921142578
Albert turned towards Hayde	189.84866333007812
At what age did you leave Greece signora asked he	142.35914611816406
I left it when I was but five years old replied Hayde	93.27699279785156
And have you any recollection of your country	356.67596435546875
When I shut my eyes and think I seem to see it all again	153.71473693847656
The mind can see as well as the body	74.76805114746094
The body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers	141.30726623535156
And how far back into the past do your recollections extend	1.1438461542129517
I could scarcely walk when my mother who was called Vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord	67.361328125
Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners	151.19183349609375
And how old were you at that time	49.22037887573242
I was three years old said Hayde	63.792572021484375
Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said Albert	82.41547393798828
Count said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history	176.31207275390625
You prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips	172.5241241455078
Monte Cristo turned to Hayde and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in Greek            that is Tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason	111.86922454833984
Hayde sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	170.48829650878906
What are you saying to her said Morcerf in an undertone	202.5507354736328
I again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you	1.0454856157302856
Then said Albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance what is the next	43.923980712890625
Oh then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamoretrees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror	63.10585403442383
Under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and I childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	517.5987548828125
Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either Kill or Pardon	31.765459060668945
It is very strange said Albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self This is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	85.8927001953125
And how does France appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes	68.95928192138672
I think it is a fine country said Hayde but I see France as it really is because I look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous	2.1138858795166016
So young said Albert forgetting at the moment the Counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name	148.1011199951172
Hayde turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured	56.63133239746094
Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness	77.74502563476562
40068 m	70.05265045166016
Speak speak signora said Albert I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say	103.0177230834961
Hayde answered his remark with a melancholy smile	53.21074676513672
You wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	3.156029224395752
I beg you to do so replied Albert	40.90690612792969
Well I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my mother	144.29205322265625
We were in the palace of Yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with tears	289.0675354003906
She took me away without speaking	141.81387329101562
When I saw her weeping I began to cry too	98.83492279052734
Hush child said she	155.3708038330078
At other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats I had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she enjoined me to silence that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given	504.04681396484375
She bore me rapidly away	1.2074540853500366
I saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction	21.22403907775879
Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation	202.9452667236328
You may imagine there was something startling and ominous said Hayde shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only halfaroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	176.3308868408203
Here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pinetorches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above	64.02808380126953
Quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	27.570213317871094
This voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance	58.42981719970703
As for me it made me tremble	37.9171257019043
This voice was that of my father	3.918487548828125
He came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him	91.5267333984375
He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock	97.34221649169922
My father said Hayde raising her head was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and before whom Turkey trembled	44.17101287841797
Albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Hayde at this moment she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror	30.646032333374023
Soon said Hayde we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake	65.8700942993164
My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father who was glancing anxiously around	206.72145080566406
Four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide	54.70658493041992
40070 m	46.945194244384766
From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	53.813297271728516
This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned	40.2304801940918
We stepped into the boat	33.26777267456055
I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares	31.642906188964844
14 Besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother Selim and myself	157.4584503173828
The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	48.86371994018555
Our bark flew before the wind	463.9057312011719
Why does the boat go so fast asked I of my mother	1.0454856157302856
Silence child Hush we are flying I did not understand	40.99071502685547
Why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed to flyhe who had taken for his device	50.35257339477539
They hate me then they fear me	1.0454856157302856
It was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect	1023.9619750976562
I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina fatigued with long service	339.93096923828125
Here Hayde cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative	65.0438461303711
The young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	37.50302505493164
You were saying signora said Albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of Yanina fatigued with long service	58.7991943359375
Had treated with the Seraskier15 Kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that Ali Tepeliniafter having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom he reposed great confidenceresolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge	394.2903137207031
And this officer asked Albert do you remember his name signora	95.9016342163086
Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by Albert	67.16365814208984
No said she I do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently I will tell you	45.53682327270508
Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	151.10743713378906
It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	101.303466796875
A ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	236.67361450195312
But beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted	534.0810546875
In this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gunpowder	176.65818786621094
Near the barrels stood Selim my fathers favorite whom I mentioned to you just now	173.7749481201172
He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and Ali Tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my father	118.01239013671875
I remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning	73.30036926269531
As for me I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world I am quite sure I shall recognize Selim	108.32405853271484
I can not tell you how long we remained in this state at that period I did not even know what time meant	5941.859375
Sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selims fiery lance	7301.35302734375
My father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and I played at his feet admiring everything I saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance	182.16392517089844
The heights of Pindus towered above us the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic firtrees and myrtles	44.97388458251953
One morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual	360.0666198730469
Take courage Vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided	22.49569320678711
If my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to Yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night	108.05430603027344
But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	55.10551071166992
Oh make yourself easy on that head said Ali smiling Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter	92.18057250976562
They would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me	61.64962387084961
My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers heart	50.714317321777344
She prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinkingfor since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent feverafter which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere	73.85801696777344
Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with fear	1043.82666015625
Then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	137.7021026611328
My mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned	123.06781768798828
I saw my fathers hand tremble	84.8880844116211
A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour He then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	46.047855377197266
Vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything	308.9183654785156
In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer	221.0044708251953
Go into the cavern with Hayde	213.413818359375
I will not quit you said Vasiliki if you die my lord I will die with you	200.10780334472656
Go to Selim cried my father	45.1143684387207
Adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death	71.9052734375
Take away Vasiliki said my father to his Palikares	67.8107681274414
As for me I had been forgotten in the general confusion I ran toward Ali Tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	224.1978759765625
Oh how distinctly I remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and I feel as if it were still warm on my forehead	150.5924835205078
On descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view	1.0583261251449585
At first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves	36.2594108581543
During this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty Palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats	261.9295654296875
They were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor	374.4656066894531
My father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish	186.9779052734375
This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss	94.58072662353516
My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	79.66816711425781
Selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered	114.21002197265625
We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by Selim	54.42814636230469
In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as I was I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads	139.3072967529297
Albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of Yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	80.41400909423828
As to Hayde these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	15.600593566894531
Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity	616.2611083984375
Go on my child said the count in the Romaic language	346.63037109375
40074 m	153.1958770751953
Hayde looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative	108.56233978271484
It was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	27.009061813354492
One single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was Selims flaming lance	68.68083953857422
My mother was a Christian and she prayed	489.31597900390625
Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words God is great However my mother had still some hope	94.73320007324219
As she was coming down she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and generous	358.42523193359375
She advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened	1.0454856157302856
They are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty	136.87933349609375
What do you fear Vasiliki said Selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud	92.45336151123047
If they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death	360.3992004394531
And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Crete	389.3118591308594
16 But I being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us	67.3949966430664
My mother experienced the same sensations for I felt her tremble	27.38494873046875
Mamma mamma said I are we really to be killed And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations	8606.345703125
My child said Vasiliki may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread Then whispering to Selim she asked what were her masters orders	33.74795913696289
If he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and I am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched	1620.336181640625
My friend said my mother when your masters orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you notYes Vasiliki replied Selim tranquilly	34.29545211791992
Suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	325.2316589355469
The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable	789.3217163085938
And do you not remember the Frenchmans name said Morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	137.63816833496094
Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be silent	109.01072692871094
I do not recollect it said Hayde	1597.8782958984375
The noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern	159.53018188476562
Selim made ready his lance	237.82049560546875
Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat	1.0522047281265259
Who are you cried Selim	67.43544006347656
But whoever you may be I charge you not to advance another step	319.34881591796875
Long live the emperor said the figure	91.98368835449219
He grants a full pardon to the Vizier Ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions	227.1781463623047
My mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom	628.7544555664062
Stop said Selim seeing that she was about to go out you see I have not yet received the ringTrue said my mother	120.20571899414062
And she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to God in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence	14.776213645935059
And for the second time Hayde stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips	15.080373764038086
40076 m	55.138465881347656
Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of commandCourage	43.219482421875
Hayde dried her eyes and continued	86.40193939208984
By this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pashait was a friend	44.930450439453125
Selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	199.23606872558594
In whose name do you come said he to him	94.80282592773438
I come in the name of our master Ali Tepelini	126.44573974609375
If you come from Ali himself said Selim you know what you were charged to remit to meYes said the messenger and I bring you his ring	196.07220458984375
At these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable Selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view	69.05006408691406
I do not see what you have in your hand said Selim	89.78238677978516
Approach then said the messenger or I will come nearer to you if you prefer it	65.13407897949219
I will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while I examine it	17.198530197143555
Be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim	52.48324966430664
Oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	87.53934478759766
But was it my fathers ring that was the question	166.91091918945312
Selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token	130.83782958984375
It is well said he kissing it it is my masters ring And throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it	335.11846923828125
The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	841.299072265625
At this signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared and Selim fell pierced by five blows	1.101905107498169
Each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold	196.39175415039062
At this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion	89.05252075195312
The lower rooms were entirely filled with Kourchids troops that is to say with our enemies	158.52597045898438
Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone	31.291311264038086
My mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	64.3467025756836
What do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold	38.042171478271484
What we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	44.50550079345703
Do you see this firmanI do said my father	719.2088012695312
Well read it he demands your head	226.1884765625
40078 m	65.27330780029297
My father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men	155.3797607421875
The Palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke	72.57121276855469
At the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us	326.3861389160156
Oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him Selim Selim cried he guardian of the fire do your dutySelim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost Ali At the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsthe troops were firing from underneath	243.0591278076172
Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds	440.43414306640625
My father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire	5.993442058563232
But immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured	277.4309997558594
In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	81.99991607666016
These two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	69.07417297363281
However he remained standing clinging to a window	143.3003692626953
My mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside	136.87771606445312
All around him were lying the Palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows	1.0454856157302856
At this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardstwenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet	124.27429962158203
I felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted	82.89370727539062
Haydes arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	127.0287857055664
Monte Cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in Romaic	60.02057647705078
Calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors	124.96932220458984
It is a frightful story count said Albert terrified at the paleness of Haydes countenance and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request	171.54832458496094
Oh it is nothing said Monte Cristo	279.9123840332031
Then patting the young girl on the head he continued Hayde is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes	170.6223907470703
Because my lord said Hayde eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness	42.25566482543945
Albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	43.403350830078125
Hayde saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued	339.9833068847656
When my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier	147.12765502929688
Kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of Ali	47.84049606323242
It is not to me to whom you must address yourself said Kourchid	250.40206909179688
To whom thenTo your new master	24.815523147583008
Who and where is heHe is here	67.21466827392578
And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said Hayde in a tone of chastened anger	77.41102600097656
Then said Albert you became the property of this man	151.02645874023438
40080 m	93.07612609863281
No replied Hayde he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slavemerchants who were going to Constantinople	139.15460205078125
We traversed Greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates	86.83065032958984
They were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words	1168.5172119140625
This is the head of Ali Tepelini Pasha of Yanina	160.35716247558594
I cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead I was taken to the slavemarket and was purchased by a rich Armenian	203.55584716796875
He caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when I was thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud	50.1898193359375
Of whom I bought her said Monte Cristo as I told you Albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills	66.77009582519531
Oh you are good you are great my lord said Hayde kissing the counts hand and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master	44.01359176635742
Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard	171.29803466796875
Come finish your cup of coffee said Monte Cristo the history is ended	162.97625732421875
Chapter 78	133.4858856201172
We hear From Yanina	117.38348388671875
If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M	247.4517822265625
Noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him	85.14542388916016
Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter	703.9476928710938
After all the disclosures which were made this morning M	93.77071380615234
Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M	11.804295539855957
Franz dpinay	166.05419921875
dpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M	66.45722198486328
de Villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement	41.83424758911133
No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	102.60919952392578
And in justice to Villefort it must be understood that M	51.34883499145508
Noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to Villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de Quesnel or the Baron dpinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	110.20113372802734
This harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort	80.9420166015625
Hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered	101.768310546875
The sudden departure of Franz after being summoned by M	29.920133590698242
Noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of Madame de Villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing	259.9918518066406
Determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance	45.53324890136719
de Villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between M	63.76088333129883
Noirtier M	73.91195678710938
dpinay and himself and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off	137.90850830078125
This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	123.02375793457031
She therefore contented herself with saying that M	97.68243408203125
Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	24.784912109375
This news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word	85.9314956665039
During this time Valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	183.6790008544922
Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited	59.41360092163086
But instead of going to her own room Valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden	119.99205780029297
In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentines mind	49.69972610473633
She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the Laird of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor	21.90016746520996
It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for Maximilian had long awaited her coming	273.5098571777344
He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M	162.45578002929688
de Villefort	70.92884826660156
He followed M	22.652667999267578
dpinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with Albert and ChteauRenaud	221.5853729248047
He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the cloverpatch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty	250.1219940185547
He was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier	55.65727233886719
The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight	52.33699035644531
We are saved said Valentine	27.801345825195312
Saved repeated Morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom	181.47665405273438
By my grandfather	56.509403228759766
Oh Morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us	66.19759368896484
Morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god	99.33683776855469
But tell me Valentine how has it all been effected What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end	4.792887210845947
Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said	41.978790283203125
At some future time I will tell you all about it	47.47368621826172
But when will that be	127.13004302978516
When I am your wife	114.80730438232422
The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	6.02509880065918
However he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night	37.34422302246094
Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz	186.02386474609375
During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M	78.24542999267578
The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	96.79285430908203
Sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded	62.53974533081055
Noirtiers countenance remained immovable	68.61475372314453
But one thing I can tell you of which I do not think you are aware that is that I have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation	213.65269470214844
Noirtier regarded his daughterinlaw with the look of a man desiring an explanation	13.472140312194824
Now that this marriage which I know you so much disliked is done away with I come to you on an errand which neither M	60.694644927978516
de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake	262.2042541503906
Noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	237.70846557617188
I come to entreat you sir continued Madame de Villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactionI come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter	158.21499633789062
There was a doubtful expression in Noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	65.60540771484375
May I hope sir said Madame de Villefort that your intentions accord with my request	59.64204406738281
Noirtier made a sign that they did	25.78142547607422
In that case sir rejoined Madame de Villefort I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes	279.0045166015625
She then bowed to M	53.92586898803711
Noirtier and retired	6.528323173522949
The next day M	68.48100280761719
Noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	72.59114837646484
It was then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of SaintMran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300000 livres	49.70225143432617
While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriagecontract were being carried on at the house of M	47.04304504394531
de Villefort Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to M	46.385616302490234
Danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenantgeneral which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la Chausse dAntin	73.0101089477539
Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor	157.32037353515625
At the first sight of his old friend Danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easychair	136.1162567138672
Morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point	100.05609130859375
40086 m	18.76092529296875
Well baron said he here I am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed	88.98350524902344
Morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	133.93487548828125
To what do you allude monsieur said Danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals words	73.36894226074219
Ah said Morcerf I see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted	402.6825256347656
Ma foi I beg your pardon but as I have but one son and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him I am still serving my apprenticeship you know come I will reform	85.27122497558594
And Morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to M	107.94929504394531
Danglars said	28.545915603637695
Baron I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars for my son the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf	162.45748901367188
But Danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said	23.888736724853516
Monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer	134.35813903808594
To reflect said Morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us	58.26033020019531
Count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them	363.8830261230469
I do not understand you baron said Morcerf	92.10535430908203
What I mean to say is this sirthat during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred	190.60870361328125
Excuse me said Morcerf but is it a play we are acting	622.98779296875
A play	58.079593658447266
Yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other	52.21601486206055
That is quite my desire	60.27669906616211
You have seen M	62.61881637573242
de Monte Cristo have you not	115.76675415039062
I see him very often said Danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine	363.2691345214844
Well in one of your late conversations with him you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not	24.123905181884766
I did say so	96.68131256103516
Well here I am proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score	212.0865936279297
Danglars did not answer	77.7835922241211
Have you so soon changed your mind added Morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled	118.38500213623047
Danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to Morcerf and said	37.98350524902344
Count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me	13.870150566101074
These are all so many empty words my dear sir said Morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing	2.189779281616211
Danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed	74.66377258300781
I am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker	17.053674697875977
What do you mean to say	742.6417846679688
I mean to say that I have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain	140.9127197265625
You must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family	69.14031219482422
No sir said Danglars I merely suspend my decision that is all	90.99562072753906
And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces	92.0716323852539
Then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained	132.6583251953125
The count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	46.088043212890625
A cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there	125.74945068359375
My dear Danglars said Morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings	60.30936050415039
You owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor	296.68524169921875
It is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all I can say sir replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed down	41.98627853393555
And towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said Morcerf turning pale with anger	117.91580963134766
The expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said	35.833045959472656
You may perhaps be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars	306.0498962402344
A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	182.14186096191406
Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased you Is it my fortune which you find insufficient Is it because my opinions differ from yours	79.1016845703125
Nothing of the kind sir replied Danglars if such had been the case I only should have been to blame inasmuch as I was aware of all these things when I made the engagement	188.34738159179688
No do not seek any longer to discover the reason	250.26670837402344
I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe selfexamination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement	196.90072631835938
Ma foi there is no hurry	54.44532012939453
My daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twentyone	6.462138652801514
While we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies	133.53720092773438
Calumnies did you say sir cried Morcerf turning livid with rage	91.31765747070312
Does anyone dare to slander me	64.30375671386719
Monsieur I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation	16.40526008605957
Then sir I am patiently to submit to your refusal	32.69633483886719
Yes sir although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman	92.85753631591797
Enough sir said Morcerf we will speak no more on the subject	291.76568603515625
And clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	282.61981201171875
Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word	80.12962341308594
That evening he had a long conference with several friends and M	393.8369140625
Cavalcanti who had remained in the drawingroom with the ladies was the last to leave the bankers house	634.4638061523438
The next morning as soon as he awoke Danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on lImpartial the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor	293.21002197265625
He hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed	54.739986419677734
We hear from Yanina	153.6039581298828
Very good observed Danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on Colonel Fernand which if I am not mistaken would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary	116.06722259521484
At the same moment that is at nine oclock in the morning Albert de Morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristos house in the Champslyses	62.428253173828125
When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously	40.17058563232422
Did he take Baptistin with him	145.8614044189453
No my lord	117.26124572753906
Call him then I wish to speak to him	64.83424377441406
The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant	30.771503448486328
My good friend said Albert I beg pardon for my intrusion but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not	56.93288040161133
He is really out sir replied Baptistin	63.005191802978516
Out even to me	54.582374572753906
I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said Baptistin and I should therefore never think of including him in any general order	57.339637756347656
You are right and now I wish to see him on an affair of great importance	293.4352111816406
Do you think it will be long before he comes in	196.52110290527344
No I think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock	415.8882141113281
Well I will go and take a turn in the Champslyses and at ten oclock I will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me	47.026607513427734
You may depend on my doing so sir said Baptistin	177.76412963867188
Albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on foot	30.105449676513672
As he was passing the Alle des Veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standing at Gossets shootinggallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman	121.10963439941406
Is the count shooting in the gallery said Morcerf	77.78158569335938
Yes sir replied the coachman	46.52081298828125
While he was speaking Albert had heard the report of two or three pistolshots	100.44784545898438
He entered and on his way met the waiter	76.78041076660156
Excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment	168.04043579101562
What for Philip asked Albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	39.3143424987793
Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone	122.3548355102539
Not even before you Philip Then who loads his pistol	152.76890563964844
His servant	70.2677993774414
A Nubian	32.65108108520508
A negro	137.25778198242188
It is he then	346.62969970703125
Do you know this gentleman	87.59888458251953
Yes and I am come to look for him he is a friend of mine	106.1369400024414
Oh that is quite another thing then	9.02847957611084
I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival	76.4272232055664
And Philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold	68.80294036865234
I ask your pardon my dear count said Albert for following you here and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so I alone am to blame for the indiscretion	109.58543395996094
I went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to breakfast	2198.188232421875
I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when I caught sight of your carriage and horses	54.55513000488281
What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me	185.67904663085938
40092 m	67.64948272705078
No thank you I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company	137.1626434326172
What on earth are you talking of	1.1732761859893799
I am to fight today	47.73704147338867
For what	236.9586181640625
For the sake of fighting	220.8392791748047
Yes I understand that but what is the quarrel People fight for all sorts of reasons you know	20.568382263183594
I fight in the cause of honor	84.6656723022461
Ah that is something serious	10.153081893920898
So serious that I come to beg you to render me a service	78.41837310791016
What is it	23.53453826904297
To be my second	534.3464965820312
That is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home	30.158662796020508
Ali bring me some water	24.372941970825195
The count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	13.248246192932129
Come in my lord said Philip in a low tone and I will show you something droll	468.6307067871094
Morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the wall	19.84879493713379
At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten	4.629002094268799
Ah ha said Albert I see you were preparing for a game of cards	982.7775268554688
No said the count I was making a suit	289.5107116699219
How said Albert	49.40525817871094
Those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens	55.89863967895508
Albert approached	98.29255676269531
In fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil	31.82250213623047
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol	592.1441040039062
Diable said Morcerf	346.3514709472656
What would you have my dear viscount said Monte Cristo wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other	91.25554656982422
But come I am waiting for you	141.5965576171875
Both men entered Monte Cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No	34.488521575927734
Monte Cristo took Albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself	152.1937255859375
Now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	118.19541931152344
You see I am perfectly composed said Albert	52.87582778930664
With whom are you going to fight	81.68397521972656
With Beauchamp	127.95307159423828
One of your friends	127.8083724975586
Of course it is always with friends that one fights	11.131877899169922
I suppose you have some cause of quarrel	124.61449432373047
I have	85.9545669555664
40094 m	225.528076171875
What has he done to you	333.13043212890625
There appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for yourself	148.89785766601562
And Albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows	56.219547271728516
A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance	5.95742130279541
The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand in whom the grand vizier Ali Tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence	61.55727005004883
Well said Monte Cristo what do you see in that to annoy you	99.82939147949219
What do I see in it	89.3614273071289
Yes what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer	110.42174530029297
It signifies to my father the Count of Morcerf whose Christian name is Fernand	109.40310668945312
Did your father serve under Ali Pasha	25.14384651184082
Yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the Greeks and hence arises the calumny	123.86986541748047
Oh my dear viscount do talk reason	316.70697021484375
I do not desire to do otherwise	62.70559310913086
Now just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person and who cares now about Yanina which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823	21.371845245361328
That just shows the meanness of this slander	39.47871398925781
They have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position	68.46724700927734
I inherit my fathers name and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it	17.397165298461914
I am going to Beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses	390.3455810546875
Beauchamp will never retract	72.61333465576172
Then we must fight	269.3572998046875
No you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name	6.971667766571045
We will fight nevertheless	50.23868942260742
I will efface that blot on my fathers character	329.58489990234375
My father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant	234.8597869873047
Oh well he will add We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf who also bears the same Christian name	69.88565826416016
I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation	69.95140838623047
And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you	148.7095489501953
You do wrong	130.72483825683594
Which means I suppose that you refuse the service which I asked of you	121.90042877197266
You know my theory regarding duels I told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at Rome	60.38699722290039
Nevertheless my dear count I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain	88.83300018310547
Because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	44.82807922363281
If ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly	74.61906433105469
I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and I am expected to kill him for all that	33.194602966308594
You admit that you would fight then Well if so why do you object to my doing so	31.856386184692383
I do not say that you ought not to fight I only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection	71.27174377441406
Did he reflect before he insulted my father	107.32933044433594
If he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied	75.98021697998047
Ah my dear count you are far too indulgent	52.37758255004883
And you are far too exacting	65.52655792236328
Supposing for instance and do not be angry at what I am going to say	202.8074188232422
Supposing the assertion to be really true	34.93716812133789
A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor	83.50823974609375
Ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit	1.8319061994552612
That is precisely the fault of the age	939.126953125
And do you undertake to reform it	54.20530700683594
Yes as far as I am personally concerned	17.058021545410156
Well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow	195.5775909423828
Yes I own it	357.58941650390625
Are you quite impervious to good advice	2664.97607421875
Not when it comes from a friend	89.49933624267578
And do you account me that title	123.83307647705078
Certainly I do	15.526873588562012
Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject	313.4560852050781
From whom	127.57505798339844
From Hayde	189.7579803466797
Why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it	1338.2213134765625
She can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to	3733.62841796875
I have told you my dear count that I would not for one moment admit of such a proposition	102.04285430908203
You reject this means of information then	76.12796020507812
I domost decidedly	723.5218505859375
Then let me offer one more word of advice	178.9815216064453
Do so then but let it be the last	199.62290954589844
You do not wish to hear it perhaps	331.93109130859375
On the contrary I request it	188.21298217773438
Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchampvisit him alone	3.810173511505127
That would be contrary to all custom	82.38545227050781
Your case is not an ordinary one	77.04814147949219
And what is your reason for advising me to go alone	103.7343978881836
Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp	138.20223999023438
Explain yourself	50.72186279296875
I will do so	68.19609832763672
If Beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the same	87.59687805175781
If on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret	5.909691333770752
They will not be strangers they will be friends	200.3003692626953
Ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow Beauchamp for instance	76.88468170166016
So you recommend	155.19100952148438
I recommend you to be prudent	49.367919921875
Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp	119.602294921875
I do and I will tell you why	153.76942443847656
When you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it	20.979578018188477
I believe you are right	71.54547882080078
I am glad of it	27.544578552246094
Then I will go alone	14.514452934265137
Go but you would do better still by not going at all	102.57735443115234
That is impossible	16.081029891967773
Do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed	27.410999298095703
But if in spite of all my precautions I am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second	40.3883056640625
My dear viscount said Monte Cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places I have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you	320.0999755859375
Perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons	540.9384155273438
Well I will have Franz and ChteauRenaud they will be the very men for it	94.16120147705078
Do so then	289.8888244628906
But if I do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing	95.23675537109375
That too is impossible	25.83158302307129
What a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything	68.2010726928711
You are rightthat is the principle on which I wish to act	11.131877899169922
We will say no more about it then	45.35333251953125
Goodbye count	116.78136444091797
Morcerf took his hat and left the room	22.132266998291016
He found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp who was in his office	212.1253204345703
It was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial	187.94471740722656
The servant announced M	40.833740234375
Albert de Morcerf	31.138545989990234
Beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted	154.1912384033203
Albert entered	40.826107025146484
Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room	36.15177536010742
This way this way my dear Albert said he holding out his hand to the young man	241.90496826171875
Are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me Try and find a seatthere is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper	46.27931594848633
Beauchamp said Albert it is of your journal that I come to speak	429.5867919921875
Indeed What do you wish to say about it	73.46844482421875
I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified	355.7381896972656
To what do you refer But pray sit down	230.84671020507812
Thank you said Albert with a cold and formal bow	234.73585510253906
Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you	370.1941833496094
An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family	80.11166381835938
What is it said Beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken	173.1922607421875
The story sent you from Yanina	49.112449645996094
Yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here	70.73646545410156
Such is really the case I assure you upon my honor Baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried Beauchamp	80.88703155517578
Here I have brought mine with me replied Albert	77.03958129882812
Beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone	146.11264038085938
You see it is a serious annoyance said Morcerf when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph	56.257572174072266
Is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist	184.64637756347656
Yes said Albert blushing	59.841651916503906
Well what do you wish me to do for you said Beauchamp mildly	121.36209106445312
My dear Beauchamp I wish you to contradict this statement	69.21429443359375
Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression	66.7551040649414
Come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know	42.01593780517578
Sit down and I will read it again	102.6355209350586
Albert resumed his seat and Beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend	4.629002094268799
Well said Albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and I insist on a retractation being made	145.7152099609375
You insist	257.44610595703125
Yes I insist	140.08946228027344
Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber my dear viscount	18.107858657836914
Nor do I wish to be there replied the young man rising	119.2750473022461
I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted	298.1365966796875
You have known me long enough continued Albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that Beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point	116.52259826660156
If I have been your friend Morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title	100.75130462646484
But wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet	47.19792175292969
You are irritated and vexedtell me how this Fernand is related to you	26.98526382446289
He is merely my father said AlbertM	41.117576599121094
Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace	64.95746612548828
Is it your father said Beauchamp that is quite another thing	72.0437240600586
Then I can well understand your indignation my dear Albert	77.71548461914062
I will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded	72.89402770996094
But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father	54.74679946899414
40100 m	62.09129333496094
No but the connection will be seen by others and therefore I will have the article contradicted	208.0113525390625
At the words I will Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments	49.44662857055664
You will retract this assertion will you not Beauchamp said Albert with increased though stifled anger	57.945064544677734
Yes replied Beauchamp	4.351946830749512
Immediately said Albert	94.1561279296875
When I am convinced that the statement is false	46.94252395629883
The thing is worth looking into and I will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly	21.08198356628418
But what is there to investigate sir said Albert enraged beyond measure at Beauchamps last remark	214.37530517578125
If you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so	17.053674697875977
Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind	33.83977127075195
Sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour	5.472487926483154
Am I to put this construction on your visit	107.69145965576172
Yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny	82.56746673583984
Wait a momentno threats if you please M	25.252466201782227
Fernand Mondego Vicomte de Morcerf I never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	8.833962440490723
You insist on my contradicting the article relating to General Fernand an article with which I assure you on my word of honor I had nothing whatever to do	55.20718765258789
Yes I insist on it said Albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings	27.673006057739258
And if I refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said Beauchamp in a calm tone	152.23028564453125
Yes replied Albert raising his voice	62.47664260864258
Well said Beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	85.86746978759766
The article was not inserted by meI was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so	28.782337188720703
Sir said Albert rising I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons	1766.0318603515625
Certainly my dear sir	37.25234603881836
And this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet	169.6100616455078
No no I will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is I who have received the provocationin my opinion the time ought not to be yet	66.03998565673828
I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while I am only moderately so I know too that you are a good marksmanthere we are about equal	72.3943862915039
I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and I am brave also	185.10205078125
I do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause	49.16904067993164
Now I am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	107.0200424194336
Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it although I have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand	85.88581085205078
I maintain my original resolution	111.12346649169922
Very well my dear sir then I consent to cut throats with you	99.7353286743164
But I require three weeks preparation at the end of that time I shall come and say to you The assertion is false and I retract it or The assertion is true when I shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please	45.65946578979492
Three weeks cried Albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor	80.91010284423828
Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me I should have said Patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore I say What does that signify to me sir	96.14274597167969
Well let it be three weeks then said Morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in	43.33620071411133
Albert de Morcerf said Beauchamp rising in his turn I can not throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twentyfour days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	397.6746826171875
Today is the 29th of August the 21st of September will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrivesand it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give youtill then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other	163.7147979736328
When he had concluded his speech Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert turned his back upon him and went to the pressroom	285.5710754394531
Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departednot however without walking several times to the door of the pressroom as if he had half a mind to enter	93.4598388671875
40104 m	89.21854400634766
While Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye	26.393739700317383
He was passing the Chinese Baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte SaintMartin and to be going towards the Madeleine	170.63851928710938
Ah said Morcerf there goes a happy man And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his opinion	129.17738342285156
Chapter 79	46.4327278137207
The Lemonade	97.63512420654297
Morrel was in fact very happy	142.86106872558594
Noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cabhorse	90.99301147460938
He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg SaintHonor	96.18882751464844
Morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor Barrois followed him as he best might	55.445491790771484
Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois was sixty years of age Morrel was deeply in love and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion	141.02059936523438
These two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union	70.1679458618164
This point of union was Noirtier and it was he who had just sent for Morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to hima command which Morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of Barrois	251.0492401123047
On arriving at the house Morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but Barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	18.381269454956055
The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine	470.1944274902344
She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	91.8690185546875
But the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room	98.11162567138672
Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from despair	56.514068603515625
Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	1.0639532804489136
Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	10.952422142028809
Noirtier fixed his eyes on her	231.86981201171875
Am I to say what you told me asked Valentine	101.21563720703125
Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	180.05796813964844
Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather M	149.28695678710938
Noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that I may repeat them to you	82.96389770507812
I will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter I will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions	160.1482391357422
Oh I am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak I beg of you	185.7693634033203
Valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for Morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming Valentine	48.40750503540039
My grandfather intends leaving this house said she and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another	126.0653076171875
But you Mademoiselle de Villefortyou who are necessary to M	76.01424407958984
Noirtiers happiness	327.99609375
I interrupted Valentine I shall not leave my grandfatherthat is an understood thing between us	318.0370788574219
My apartment will be close to his	82.82598876953125
Now M	137.66842651367188
de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case I shall leave directly and in the second I shall wait till I am of age which will be in about ten months	85.67794036865234
Then I shall be free I shall have an independent fortune and	91.42344665527344
And what demanded Morrel	116.28343200683594
And with my grandfathers consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made you	44.901493072509766
Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but Morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them	58.01050567626953
Have I not explained your wishes grandpapa said Valentine addressing Noirtier	170.07183837890625
Yes looked the old man	134.11605834960938
Once under my grandfathers roof M	180.942138671875
Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case I shall expect M	103.52542114257812
Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands	153.64659118652344
But alas I have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security I trust we shall never find it so in our experience	1.4125440120697021
Oh cried Morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness	57.27840042114258
Until that time continued the young girl in a calm and selfpossessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and I repeat it because it expresses all I wish to conveywe will wait	80.45704650878906
And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said Morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness	150.61021423339844
Therefore continued Valentine looking playfully at Maximilian no more inconsiderate actionsno more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name	175.8140411376953
Morrel looked obedience to her commands	42.03635025024414
Noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while Barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead	62.03761291503906
How hot you look my good Barrois said Valentine	133.54177856445312
Ah I have been running very fast mademoiselle but I must do M	80.49296569824219
Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster	83.3807601928711
Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass	43.431373596191406
The decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by M	94.31146240234375
Come Barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade I see you are coveting a good draught of it	26.240455627441406
The fact is mademoiselle said Barrois I am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me I can not say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it	149.87953186035156
Take some then and come back immediately	24.85354232788086
Barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled	228.4507598876953
Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the doorbell	115.40420532226562
It was the signal of a visit	164.0815887451172
Valentine looked at her watch	72.27163696289062
It is past noon said she and today is Saturday I dare say it is the doctor grandpapa	35.71072006225586
Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition	259.9676818847656
He will come in here and M	62.11753463745117
Morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa	124.53240203857422
Yes signed the old man	82.64466857910156
Barrois cried Valentine Barrois	40.75354766845703
I am coming mademoiselle replied he	132.3397674560547
Barrois will open the door for you said Valentine addressing Morrel	91.72071838378906
And now remember one thing Monsieur Officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or illadvised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness	107.10610961914062
40108 m	70.08277893066406
I promised him to wait replied Morrel and I will wait	77.53089904785156
At this moment Barrois entered	2.0066769123077393
Who rang asked Valentine	64.45018768310547
Doctor dAvrigny said Barrois staggering as if he would fall	79.96003723144531
What is the matter Barrois said Valentine	142.12277221679688
The old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright	120.66635131835938
He is going to fall cried Morrel	493.9041748046875
The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder	190.1688690185547
Noirtier seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man	112.16492462158203
Barrois made some steps towards his master	19.089244842529297
Ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me	125.0999526977539
I am sufferingI can not see	54.105716705322266
A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain	573.088623046875
Ah do nt touch me pray do nt	44.56301498413086
By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen	74.07588195800781
Valentine uttered a cry of horror Morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger	216.43157958984375
dAvrigny M	72.9925308227539
dAvrigny cried she in a stifled voice	25.825241088867188
Help help	1.6590360403060913
Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps then fell at the feet of Noirtier and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid exclaimed	104.73011779785156
My master my good master	119.46539306640625
At this moment M	54.356048583984375
de Villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold	63.64311981201172
Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain	40.9725227355957
Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer	71.61151885986328
Noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	263.6748046875
One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body	116.13603973388672
Barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	81.75135040283203
A slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	47.63855743408203
Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	162.46051025390625
He had not seen Morrel	183.189697265625
After a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out	49.562652587890625
Doctor doctor come instantly pray come	37.368858337402344
Madame madame cried Valentine calling her stepmother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quickand bring your bottle of smellingsalts with you	236.6484375
What is the matter said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and constrained tone	132.4899139404297
Oh come come	573.994140625
But where is the doctor exclaimed Villefort where is he	16.962100982666016
Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	47.853248596191406
In one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of English smellingsalts	65.56646728515625
Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	112.10738372802734
She turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	34.71161651611328
In the name of heaven madame said Villefort where is the doctor He was with you just now	75.55879974365234
You see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled	151.11744689941406
Has he eaten anything lately asked Madame de Villefort eluding her husbands question	192.11465454101562
Madame replied Valentine he has not even breakfasted	70.03901672363281
He has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade	95.75955963134766
Ah said Madame de Villefort why did he not take wine Lemonade was a very bad thing for him	138.91903686523438
Grandpapas bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side poor Barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find	219.8063507080078
Madame de Villefort started	40.84468078613281
Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny	33.382415771484375
He has such a short neck said she	98.60826110839844
Madame said Villefort I ask where is M	69.57391357421875
dAvrigny In Gods name answer me	78.06903839111328
He is with Edward who is not quite well replied Madame de Villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	119.13954162597656
Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him	23.163354873657227
Take this said Madame de Villefort giving her smellingbottle to Valentine	8.476186752319336
They will no doubt bleed him therefore I will retire for I can not endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband upstairs	65.81845092773438
Morrel now emerged from his hidingplace where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion	134.3615264892578
Go away as quick as you can Maximilian said Valentine and stay till I send for you	169.23463439941406
Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire	133.6412811279297
The old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	94.01014709472656
The young man pressed Valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase	54.29255676269531
At the same moment that he quitted the room Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door	129.86427307128906
Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness	88.76288604736328
The crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee	50.037994384765625
DAvrigny and Villefort laid him on a couch	39.555992126464844
What do you prescribe doctor demanded Villefort	7.018808841705322
Give me some water and ether	46.047855377197266
You have some in the house have you not	348.0406188964844
Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic	61.1112060546875
Villefort immediately despatched a messenger	16.72665023803711
And now let everyone retire	88.68690490722656
Must I go too asked Valentine timidly	44.21221923828125
Yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly	12.574432373046875
Valentine looked at M	57.088401794433594
dAvrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room	54.239524841308594
The doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	134.91197204589844
Look look doctor said Villefort he is quite coming round again I really do not think after all it is anything of consequence	45.60194396972656
dAvrigny answered by a melancholy smile	59.947383880615234
How do you feel Barrois asked he	1.2174072265625
A little better sir	375.3723449707031
Will you drink some of this ether and water	170.82273864746094
I will try but do nt touch me	94.18324279785156
Why not	238.09881591796875
Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return	53.39030456542969
Barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	24.995067596435547
Where do you suffer asked the doctor	47.35403060913086
I feel cramps over my whole body	61.898494720458984
Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes	82.46166229248047
Any noise in the ears	62.37457275390625
40112 m	21.742345809936523
When did you first feel that	31.12859344482422
Just now	243.56845092773438
Yes like a clap of thunder	79.32061004638672
Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before	73.25676727294922
No drowsiness	87.38011932373047
What have you eaten today	78.64154815673828
I have eaten nothing I only drank a glass of my masters lemonadethats all	174.14324951171875
And Barrois turned towards Noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him	54.658477783203125
Where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	27.7663631439209
Downstairs in the decanter	400.4910888671875
Whereabouts downstairs	146.84820556640625
In the kitchen	355.1673583984375
Shall I go and fetch it doctor inquired Villefort	43.145389556884766
No stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	502.5087585449219
I will go myself and fetch the lemonade	64.17514038085938
DAvrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen	25.189117431640625
She cried out but dAvrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	82.07451629638672
He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey	3.298137664794922
Panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left	26.746728897094727
Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	178.94822692871094
Is this the decanter you spoke of asked dAvrigny	179.680419921875
Yes doctor	90.26333618164062
Is this the same lemonade of which you partook	82.67095947265625
I believe so	123.16961669921875
What did it taste like	92.4055404663086
It had a bitter taste	123.55780029296875
The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace	90.92049407958984
It is no doubt the same said he	86.8504409790039
Did you drink some too M	28.615270614624023
And did you also discover a bitter taste	53.028106689453125
Oh doctor cried Barrois the fit is coming on again	175.03152465820312
Oh do something for me	78.62440490722656
The doctor flew to his patient	176.15509033203125
That emetic Villefortsee if it is coming	79.96526336669922
Villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming The emetic the emeticis it come yet No one answered	250.26766967773438
The most profound terror reigned throughout the house	54.727195739746094
If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs said dAvrigny looking around him perhaps I might prevent suffocation	13.913322448730469
But there is nothing which would donothing	8929.1572265625
40114 m	368.27301025390625
Oh sir cried Barrois are you going to let me die without help Oh I am dying Oh save me	53.737152099609375
A pen a pen said the doctor	282.5531005859375
There was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them	78.9758071899414
This second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony	170.84205627441406
The doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to Noirtier said abruptly	71.48214721679688
How do you find yourselfwell	89.60887145996094
Have you any weight on the chest or does your stomach feel light and comfortableeh	239.0553436279297
Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday	3540.55615234375
Did Barrois make your lemonade	54.6988410949707
Was it you who asked him to drink some of it	18.977298736572266
Was it M	4.351946830749512
de Villefort	128.74171447753906
It was your granddaughter then was it not	1.4238959550857544
A groan from Barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of M	54.3473014831543
dAvrigny he left M	39.686248779296875
Noirtier and returned to the sick man	143.46116638183594
Barrois said the doctor can you speak Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words	38.49715805053711
Try and make an effort to do so my good man	55.70561981201172
said dAvrigny	27.59284210205078
Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes	138.04864501953125
Who made the lemonade	93.80814361572266
I did	47.30046463012695
Did you bring it to your master directly it was made	66.72722625732422
You left it somewhere then in the meantime	82.16802978515625
Yes I left it in the pantry because I was called away	63.386112213134766
Who brought it into this room then	199.71173095703125
Mademoiselle Valentine	223.68841552734375
DAvrigny struck his forehead with his hand	141.17897033691406
Gracious heaven exclaimed he	107.53074645996094
Doctor doctor cried Barrois who felt another fit coming	168.68003845214844
Will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor	289.5358581542969
Here is a glass with one already prepared said Villefort entering the room	422.0762634277344
Who prepared it	78.02076721191406
The chemist who came here with me	333.2391052246094
40116 m	388.01177978515625
Drink it said the doctor to Barrois	31.681110382080078
Impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up	4320.05419921875
I am choking Oh my heart Ah my headOh what agonyShall I suffer like this long	339.04193115234375
No no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer	1069.0228271484375
Ah I understand you said the unhappy man	5.344667434692383
My God have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry Barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning	20.64084243774414
DAvrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips	596.1873168945312
Well said Villefort	169.801025390625
Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets	2140.7734375
Villefort went immediately	1035.3929443359375
Do not be alarmed M	83.20635986328125
Noirtier said dAvrigny I am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness	152.06959533691406
And taking Barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade	200.0395965576172
Noirtier closed his right eye	212.39486694335938
You want Valentine do you not I will tell them to send her to you	141.0150146484375
Villefort returned and dAvrigny met him in the passage	27.524999618530273
Well how is he now asked he	203.24732971191406
Come in here said dAvrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay	98.1967544555664
Is he still in a fit said the procureur	42.75078582763672
He is dead	375.97174072265625
Villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy Deadand so soon too	46.65012741088867
Yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you Monsieur and Madame de SaintMran died as soon	57.74432373046875
People die very suddenly in your house M	150.06103515625
de Villefort	230.41000366210938
What cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea	40.028709411621094
Still sir and I shall always do so replied dAvrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time listen well to what I am going to say M	28.164371490478516
de Villefort	60.92949295043945
The magistrate trembled convulsively	1188.5146484375
There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	97.859130859375
I know it well I have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	80.68148803710938
I recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de SaintMran	76.00931549072266
There is a way of detecting its presence	13.817779541015625
It restores the blue color of litmuspaper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green	42.95668029785156
We have no litmuspaper but see here they come with the syrup of violets	99.9439926147461
The doctor was right steps were heard in the passage	163.54736328125
dAvrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door	51.39881134033203
Look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M	162.89149475097656
Noirtier and Barrois partook	295.1994323730469
If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on the contrary the lemonade be drugged with poison the syrup will become green	83.65579223632812
Look closely	42.01431655883789
The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald	143.98765563964844
Arrived at this last hue it changed no more	108.57030487060547
The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind	29.612865447998047
The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned said dAvrigny and I will maintain this assertion before God and man	70.68592071533203
Villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair	100.64389038085938
Chapter 80	79.71186065673828
The Accusation	208.17257690429688
dAvrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death	200.38204956054688
Oh death is in my house cried Villefort	130.1565704345703
Say rather crime replied the doctor	93.33731842041016
dAvrigny cried Villefort I can not tell you all I feel at this momentterror grief madness	46.13324737548828
Yes said M	62.529396057128906
dAvrigny with an imposing calmness but I think it is now time to act	59.065650939941406
I think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality	68.14483642578125
I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged	106.25421142578125
Villefort cast a gloomy look around him	14.130656242370605
In my house murmured he in my house	139.58355712890625
Come magistrate said M	52.57276916503906
dAvrigny show yourself a man as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it	67.720458984375
You make me shudder doctor	1.5359373092651367
Do you talk of a sacrifice	75.67381286621094
I do	189.0130615234375
Do you then suspect anyone	223.18679809570312
I suspect no one death raps at your doorit entersit goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room	41.4619140625
Well I follow its course I track its passage I adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well	14.334113121032715
Oh speak speak doctor I shall have courage	44.86684036254883
Well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one	42.134368896484375
Locusta and Agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of the Roman empire sullied by so many crimes	64.45584106445312
Brunhilda and Fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness	74.81177520751953
All these women had been or were beautiful	38.211997985839844
The same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house	370.29833984375
40120 m	100.40326690673828
Villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air	166.85028076171875
But the latter went on without pity	51.954193115234375
Seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence	90.70752716064453
Doctor cried Villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	29.385602951049805
I know not why but I feel that this crime	189.2838897705078
You acknowledge then the existence of the crime	498.30230712890625
Yes I see too plainly that it does exist	99.4078598022461
But it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	193.14810180664062
I fear an attack myself after all these disasters	34.02659225463867
Oh man murmured dAvrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alonean ant cursing God from the top of a blade of grass And have those who have lost their lives lost nothingM	48.034393310546875
de SaintMran Madame de SaintMran M	669.548583984375
How M	230.26821899414062
Yes think you it was the poor servants life was coveted No no like Shakespeares Polonius he died for another	189.634521484375
It was Noirtier the lemonade was intended forit is Noirtier logically speaking who drank it	659.2357788085938
The other drank it only by accident and although Barrois is dead it was Noirtier whose death was wished for	108.39671325683594
But why did it not kill my father	141.9681396484375
I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de SaintMrans deathbecause his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months I have given M	646.693115234375
Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison	67.51172637939453
Oh have pityhave pity murmured Villefort wringing his hands	212.3196258544922
Follow the culprits steps he first kills M	54.398284912109375
de SaintMran	93.84558868408203
Oh doctor	31.181249618530273
I would swear to it what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what I have seen in the other cases	37.1143684387207
Villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	52.05419158935547
He first kills M	73.10308074951172
de SaintMran repeated the doctor then Madame de SaintMrana double fortune to inherit	492.30462646484375
Villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead	42.63759231567383
Listen attentively	104.1920166015625
Alas stammered Villefort I do not lose a single word	30.995710372924805
Noirtier resumed M	49.956024169921875
dAvrigny in the same pitiless toneM	147.42225646972656
Noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact M	78.14848327636719
Noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him	94.01785278320312
But he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down	67.17176055908203
The will was made the day before yesterday I believe you see there has been no time lost	225.64466857910156
Oh mercy M	48.84592056274414
No mercy sir The physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb	79.4866714477539
When crime has been committed and God doubtless in anger turns away his face it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice	346.44775390625
40122 m	104.67211151123047
Have mercy on my child sir murmured Villefort	110.96985626220703
You see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father	78.45501708984375
Have pity on Valentine Listen it is impossible	109.98192596435547
I would as willingly accuse myself Valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily	101.84030151367188
No pity procureur the crime is fragrant	524.2789306640625
Mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to M	56.01702880859375
de SaintMran and M	123.36629486083984
de SaintMran is dead	53.69544219970703
Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which Madame de SaintMran took and Madame de SaintMran is dead	173.10325622558594
Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois who was sent out the lemonade which M	64.35421752929688
Noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	69.72026824951172
Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culpritshe is the poisoner To you as the kings attorney I denounce Mademoiselle de Villefort do your duty	69.10260009765625
Doctor I resist no longerI can no longer defend myselfI believe you but for pitys sake spare my life my honor	1207.071044921875
de Villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when I dispense with all foolish human circumspection	105.38858032226562
If your daughter had committed only one crime and I saw her meditating another I would say Warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying	111.57355499267578
If she had committed two crimes I would say Here M	172.43331909179688
de Villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted withone that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to God and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and I can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations	168.5143280029297
Woe to you M	245.6735382080078
de Villefort if you do not strike first This is what I would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deathshas contemplated three murdered personshas knelt by three corpses To the scaffold with the poisonerto the scaffold Do you talk of your honor Do what I tell you and immortality awaits you	138.91175842285156
Villefort fell on his knees	88.06439971923828
Listen said he I have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned	82.68827056884766
The doctor turned pale	37.2467155456543
Doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die I am content to suffer and to await death	381.2336120605469
Beware said M	60.13275909423828
dAvrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son	175.11016845703125
Villefort suffocating pressed the doctors arm	193.0030975341797
40124 m	203.30519104003906
Listen cried he pity mehelp me No my daughter is not guilty	755.4334716796875
If you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say No my daughter is not guiltythere is no crime in my house	77.25426483154297
I will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone	81.78717803955078
What does it signify to you if I am murdered Are you my friend Are you a man Have you a heart No you are a physician Well I tell you I will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner The bare idea would kill mewould drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my fingernails And if you were mistaken doctorif it were not my daughterif I should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you Assassin you have killed my childholdif that should happen although I am a Christian M	185.22874450683594
dAvrigny I should kill myself	289.05511474609375
Well said the doctor after a moments silence I will wait	43.75917434692383
Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words	54.52775573730469
Only continued M	66.24303436279297
dAvrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for I will come no more	74.73743438720703
I will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house	96.39527130126953
Then you abandon me doctor	215.39268493652344
Yes for I can follow you no farther and I only stop at the foot of the scaffold	125.19536590576172
Some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close	32.1041374206543
I entreat you doctor	113.19210052490234
All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal	188.8120880126953
Adieu sir	164.19451904296875
One wordone single word more doctor You go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	44.10053253173828
But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant	1.1518850326538086
True said M	64.4253921508789
dAvrigny we will return	258.41021728515625
The doctor went out first followed by M	153.82955932617188
de Villefort	68.4207763671875
The terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass	59.47732162475586
Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort so loud that all might hear poor Barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of Europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	14.319255828857422
He was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and I was called in too late	36.74116516113281
By the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes	51.5868034362793
The doctor without shaking hands with Villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household	19.19561004638672
The same evening all Villeforts servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell Madame de Villefort that they wished to leave	109.75234985351562
No entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied We must go for death is in this house	112.59639739990234
They all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially Mademoiselle Valentine so good so kind and so gentle	116.90717315673828
Villefort looked at Valentine as they said this	82.23928833007812
She was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at Madame de Villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	65.9625015258789
Chapter 81	2780.79443359375
The Room of the Retired Baker	8698.8720703125
The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance M	133.8231658935547
Andrea Cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in Rue de la Chausse dAntin	131.29061889648438
He had not been more than ten minutes in the drawingroom before he drew Danglars aside into the recess of a bowwindow and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble fathers departure	57.38309860229492
He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars	168.48292541503906
Danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to Morcerf	48.6690673828125
He would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few conscientious objections	18.612565994262695
Are you not rather young M	158.3264617919922
Andrea to think of marrying	912.88232421875
I think not sir replied M	76.03179168701172
Cavalcanti in Italy the nobility generally marry young	38.36228942871094
Life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach	281.2397155761719
Well sir said Danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled So important a negotiation should I think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people	29.365116119384766
Sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence	2.1777563095092773
Thinking that I might wish to settle in France he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150000 livres per annum from the day I was married	58.305572509765625
So far as I can judge I suppose this to be a quarter of my fathers revenue	707.2162475585938
I said Danglars have always intended giving my daughter 500000 francs as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress	134.33827209472656
All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing	192.01876831054688
We should command an annuity of 175000 livres	76.93356323242188
Supposing also I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent	126.6763916015625
I never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my soninlaw I would give five and we would share the profits	71.3605728149414
Very good fatherinlaw said Cavalcanti yielding to his lowborn nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it	71.74512481689453
Correcting himself immediately he said Excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do	133.77078247070312
But said Danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you	66.13339233398438
Which asked the young man	78.97366333007812
That you inherit from your mother	97.0022964477539
Truly from my mother Leonora Corsinari	109.25922393798828
How much may it amount to	75.35101318359375
Indeed sir said Andrea I assure you I have never given the subject a thought but I suppose it must have been at least two millions	85.23170471191406
Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up	63.54429244995117
Well sir said Andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may I hope	171.6259765625
You may not only hope said Danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part	238.351806640625
I am indeed rejoiced said Andrea	87.0901870727539
But said Danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron M	126.92840576171875
de Monte Cristo did not make his proposal for you	2.808231830596924
Andrea blushed imperceptibly	121.4483413696289
I have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas	80.26609802246094
He esteems me highly	1.577182650566101
He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property	31.81515884399414
He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would	86.39637756347656
I must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one	132.29086303710938
Besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him	66.0656509399414
And now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the fatherinlaw I must address myself to the banker	73.47352600097656
And what may you have to say to him said Danglars laughing in his turn	300.0887145996094
That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelors revenue could not suffice for the coming months outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs	256.5397644042969
It bears his signature as you see which is allsufficient	146.60662841796875
Bring me a million such as that said Danglars I shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	196.81707763671875
Fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs	1.2843353748321533
At ten oclock then if you please I should like it early as I am going into the country tomorrow	136.30650329589844
Very well at ten oclock you are still at the Htel des Princes	135.7997589111328
The following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse	74.2174072265625
He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening	22.141799926757812
But scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	21.835552215576172
Sir said he that man has been here	73.3484115600586
What man said Andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected	332.1622314453125
Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity	158.63441467285156
Oh said Andrea my fathers old servant	81.77037048339844
Well you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him	3.918487548828125
Yes your excellency	79.5506362915039
Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	26.673114776611328
But continued the porter he would not take them	176.57473754882812
Andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible	39.642372131347656
What he would not take them said he with slight emotion	13.829814910888672
40130 m	50.50556945800781
No he wished to speak to your excellency I told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed	254.5750274658203
Give it me said Andrea and he read by the light of his carriagelamp	34.76332092285156
You know where I live I expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock	4140.5849609375
Andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect	4750.29248046875
Very well said he	57.31845474243164
Poor man he is a worthy creature	112.68630981445312
He left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant	230.9858856201172
Take out the horses quickly and come up to me said Andrea to his groom	41.88890838623047
In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousses letter	218.95774841308594
The servant entered just as he had finished	263.2795715332031
You are about my height Pierre said he	96.70612335205078
I have that honor your excellency	285.6463928222656
You had a new livery yesterday	31.14507293701172
Yes sir	31.326881408691406
I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow	53.89616775512695
I may sleep perhaps at an inn	37.65754699707031
Pierre obeyed	23.147714614868164
Five minutes after Andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the Cheval Rouge at Picpus	19.95412826538086
The next morning he left that inn as he had left the Htel des Princes without being noticed walked down the Faubourg SaintAntoine along the boulevard to Rue Mnilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	68.05219268798828
For whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side	656.2484130859375
Monsieur Pailletin if you please my good woman replied Andrea	75.60543060302734
A retired baker asked the fruiteress	99.72639465332031
He lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story	215.58482360839844
40132 m	26.870019912719727
Andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtemper	74.06485748291016
A moment after Caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	58.158573150634766
Ah you are punctual said he as he drew back the door	52.21609878540039
Confound you and your punctuality said Andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host	183.5989532470703
Come come my little fellow do nt be angry	85.82673645019531
See I have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of	152.80548095703125
Andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to Provenal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves	66.94451141357422
These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	111.62863159179688
In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbageleaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate	142.9530487060547
What do you think of it my little fellow said Caderousse	219.3252716064453
Ay that smells good You know I used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers You were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and I think you relished them tolerably	153.8781280517578
While speaking Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions	24.374486923217773
But said Andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me I wish the devil had taken you	99.50394439697266
My boy said Caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	109.14476776123047
And then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend I am weeping with joy	17.361328125
He was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the PontduGard	78.2243881225586
Hold your tongue hypocrite said Andrea you love me	90.95353698730469
Yes I do or may the devil take me	31.185985565185547
I know it is a weakness said Caderousse but it overpowers me	23.057897567749023
And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick	9.010162353515625
Come said Caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if I did not like you do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me Think for a moment	1302.212158203125
You have your servants clothes onyou therefore keep a servant I have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals	4.322817802429199
You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table dhte of the Htel des Princes or the Caf de Paris	126.13650512695312
Well I too could keep a servant I too could have a tilbury I too could dine where I like but why do I not Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto	24.294416427612305
Come just acknowledge that I could eh	177.39088439941406
This address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand	133.40603637695312
Well said Andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you	8048.7939453125
That I may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow	1621.1300048828125
What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements	153.43704223632812
Eh dear friend said Caderousse are wills ever made without codicils But you first came to breakfast did you not Well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which I have put on some vineleaves to please you wicked one	18.052200317382812
Ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each	28.79515838623047
But what do you expect This is not the Htel des Princes	112.895263671875
Come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker	43.21957778930664
Caderousse sighed	623.7276000976562
Well what have you to say you have seen your dream realized	35.9287109375
I can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor Benedetto is richhe has an annuity	97.76249694824219
Well you have an annuity	30.708932876586914
I have	173.91993713378906
40134 m	235.8860626220703
Yes since I bring you your two hundred francs	136.46714782714844
Caderousse shrugged his shoulders	70.75080108642578
It is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudginglyan uncertain supply which may soon fail	86.45613861083984
You see I am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease	90.95535278320312
Well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	14.876546859741211
I know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of Danglars	689.7529907226562
What of Danglars	225.84640502929688
Yes to be sure must I say Baron Danglars I might as well say Count Benedetto	46.047855377197266
He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	139.67831420898438
Yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud thenhe was an underclerk to the good M	347.04266357421875
I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawingrooms	58.48466873168945
Come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light	29.29161262512207
That is all very fine Benedetto mio but I know what I am saying	108.5740966796875
Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	96.66873168945312
Meanwhile let us sit down and eat	29.051942825317383
Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor	53.457889556884766
The latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat	105.11796569824219
Ah mate said Caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord	59.578914642333984
Faith yes replied Andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	166.91847229003906
So you like it you rogue	79.1055679321289
So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living	111.9895248413086
Do you see said Caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought	515.2326049804688
What is that	130.63795471191406
That I am dependent on another I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly	52.28561782836914
Do not let that disturb you I have enough for two	51.78510665893555
No truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse	126.9701156616211
Good Caderousse	57.772804260253906
So much so that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs	116.33917236328125
Yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me	147.42471313476562
True remorse and besides an idea had struck me	4.061201095581055
Andrea shuddered he always did so at Caderousses ideas	69.31751251220703
It is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month	73.42872619628906
Oh said Andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting Do I for instance fare better Well I wait patiently do I not	59.585479736328125
Yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost	64.71934509277344
Down there you always had little presents and Christmasboxes which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse	24.357694625854492
Fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend Caderousse	112.11347961425781
There you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again	106.20037078857422
Ah you are only oneandtwenty and can forget the past I am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	57.12311935424805
But let us return to business	24.286252975463867
I was going to say if I were in your place	118.1953125
I would realize	90.9047622680664
How would you realize	493.66217041015625
I would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months I would decamp	5.983928680419922
Well well said Andrea that is nt a bad idea	108.68131256103516
My dear friend said Caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be none the worse off physically or morally	148.99502563476562
But said Andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me Why do you not realize a six months a years advance even and retire to Brussels Instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good	60.26718521118164
But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs	89.72259521484375
Ah Caderousse said Andrea how covetous you are Two months ago you were dying with hunger	82.60834503173828
The appetite grows by what it feeds on said Caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling	128.65892028808594
And added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread I have formed a plan	171.03506469726562
Caderousses plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas ideas were but the germ the plan was reality	24.83159828186035
Let me see your plan I dare say it is a pretty one	45.856258392333984
Why not Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M eh was it not I and it was no bad one I believe since here we are	95.44393157958984
I do not say replied Andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan	134.95419311523438
Well pursued Caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs No fifteen thousand are not enoughI can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs	88.60186004638672
No replied Andrea dryly no I can not	137.92935180664062
I do not think you understand me replied Caderousse calmly I said without your laying out a sou	67.69195556640625
Do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mineand both of us to be dragged down there again	38.525062561035156
It would make very little difference to me said Caderousse if I were retaken I am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again	67.15299224853516
Andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	170.84620666503906
Come Caderousse no nonsense said he	66.14307403564453
Do nt alarm yourself my little Benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and I will contrive it	136.83065795898438
Well Ill seeIll try to contrive some way said Andrea	97.87816619873047
Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow I have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper	202.7529754638672
Well you shall have your five hundred francs said Andrea but it is very hard for me my poor Caderousseyou take advantage	90.02116394042969
Bah said Caderousse when you have access to countless stores	165.9680633544922
One would have said Andrea anticipated his companions words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment	101.1740951538086
True he replied and my protector is very kind	92.36871337890625
That dear protector said Caderousse and how much does he give you monthly	126.2159194946289
Five thousand francs	158.7185516357422
As many thousands as you give me hundreds Truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate	110.81138610839844
Five thousand francs per month What the devil can you do with all that	67.60089111328125
Oh it is no trouble to spend that and I am like you I want capital	98.38507843017578
CapitalyesI understandeveryone would like capital	68.01897430419922
Well and I shall get it	53.92296600341797
Who will give it to youyour prince	451.2110290527344
Yes my prince	175.1450653076172
But unfortunately I must wait	58.36315155029297
40138 m	92.13394165039062
You must wait for what asked Caderousse	129.45411682128906
For his death	894.1731567382812
The death of your prince	68.71458435058594
How so	367.505859375
Because he has made his will in my favor	148.22439575195312
On my honor	218.3804168701172
For how much	177.70294189453125
For five hundred thousand	57.37412643432617
Only that Its little enough	34.63130569458008
But so it is	78.80663299560547
No it can not be	73.64016723632812
Are you my friend Caderousse	124.13322448730469
Yes in life or death	65.04959106445312
Well I will tell you a secret	83.7901611328125
What is it	113.34408569335938
But remember	139.75332641601562
Ah pardieu mute as a carp	205.11029052734375
Well I think	173.14981079101562
Andrea stopped and looked around	232.49778747558594
You think Do not fear pardieu we are alone	55.90079879760742
I think I have discovered my father	48.14040756225586
Your true father	75.68128967285156
Not old Cavalcanti	1.1074700355529785
No for he has gone again the true one as you say	108.9405288696289
And that father is	129.17578125
Well Caderousse it is Monte Cristo	48.31156921386719
Yes you understand that explains all	17.21827507019043
He can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through M	38.814697265625
Cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it	96.97898864746094
Fifty thousand francs for being your father I would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man	162.7743377685547
Did I know anything about it when it was all done when I was down there	73.62337493896484
Ah truly And you say that by his will	27.107784271240234
He leaves me five hundred thousand livres	84.54085540771484
Are you sure of it	251.2895965576172
He showed it me but that is not allthere is a codicil as I said just now	254.23512268066406
And in that codicil he acknowledges me	293.6259765625
Oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said Caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands	103.00175476074219
Now say if I conceal anything from you	105.66191101074219
No and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich	167.6251678466797
Yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune	97.58155059814453
Is it possible	19.874279022216797
It is evident enough to me who am always at his house	46.88300704956055
The other day a bankers clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold	83.99862670898438
Caderousse was filled with wonder the young mans words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis	45.401214599609375
And you go into that house cried he briskly	19.87370491027832
When I like	154.691650390625
Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	52.009620666503906
It was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	100.55270385742188
Then suddenly	43.51433181762695
How I should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be	108.56767272949219
It is in fact magnificent said Andrea	57.8393669128418
And does he not live in the Champslyses	70.76551055908203
Yes No	642.99072265625
Ah said Caderousse No	1.5551954507827759
Yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it	60.0971565246582
Possibly but it is not the exterior I care for it is the interior	36.39103317260742
What beautiful furniture there must be in it	72.03067016601562
Have you ever seen the Tuileries	1104.5845947265625
Well it surpasses that	48.03456115722656
It must be worth ones while to stoop Andrea when that good M	70.54641723632812
Monte Cristo lets fall his purse	79.9858169555664
It is not worthwhile to wait for that said Andrea money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard	57.293697357177734
But you should take me there one day with you	89.69377136230469
How can I On what plea	110.14104461669922
You are right but you have made my mouth water	152.88856506347656
I must absolutely see it I shall find a way	2674.847900390625
No nonsense Caderousse	1702.572509765625
I will offer myself as floorpolisher	21.102611541748047
The rooms are all carpeted	129.49343872070312
Well then I must be contented to imagine it	39.45113754272461
That is the best plan believe me	24.43765640258789
Try at least to give me an idea of what it is	23.6187686920166
How can I	66.34519958496094
Nothing is easier	297.6141662597656
Is it large	255.01544189453125
How is it arranged	75.57778930664062
Faith I should require pen ink and paper to make a plan	41.209564208984375
They are all here said Caderousse briskly	218.39321899414062
He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink	159.1291961669922
Here said Caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy	87.8824691772461
Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began	656.5469970703125
The house as I said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see Andrea drew the garden the court and the house	249.8856201171875
40142 m	51.985198974609375
High walls	79.03186798095703
Not more than eight or ten feet	59.03067398071289
That is not prudent said Caderousse	4.629002094268799
In the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of flowers	224.25848388671875
And no steeltraps	92.26345825195312
The stables	85.99153900146484
Are on either side of the gate which you see there	115.42770385742188
And Andrea continued his plan	151.74002075195312
Let us see the ground floor said Caderousse	139.539306640625
On the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the hall and a little back staircase	38.135658264160156
Magnificent windows so beautiful so large that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame	76.29705810546875
Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows	208.1281280517578
Luxury has everything	190.3008575439453
But shutters	83.64385986328125
Yes but they are never used	89.7020263671875
That Count of Monte Cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night	1264.078857421875
And where do the servants sleep	36.12638473510742
Oh they have a house to themselves	100.60186004638672
Picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders are kept	198.82986450195312
Well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments	98.92497253417969
Ah diable bells did you say	50.82874298095703
What do you mean	77.59773254394531
Oh nothing I only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them I should like to know	115.85135650634766
There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil to that you went to you know	11.04934024810791
I was saying to him only yesterday You are imprudent Monsieur Count for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected	203.93814086914062
Well said he what next Well next some day you will be robbed	900.5006103515625
What did he answer	117.44255065917969
He quietly said What do I care if I am	110.97969818115234
Andrea he has some secretaire with a spring	274.4257507324219
How do you know	533.4000244140625
Yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune	92.42462158203125
I was told there were such at the last exhibition	65.01274871826172
He has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept	136.99014282226562
And he is not robbed	118.67947387695312
No his servants are all devoted to him	132.71507263183594
There ought to be some money in that secretaire	178.8955078125
There may be	46.12697982788086
No one knows what there is	129.31654357910156
And where is it	227.8245849609375
On the first floor	104.44739532470703
Sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy	299.4079284667969
That is very simple	129.6070556640625
Andrea took the pen	71.22139739990234
On the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawingroom to the right of the drawingroom a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressingroom	117.10417938232422
The famous secretaire is in the dressingroom	9.931235313415527
Is there a window in the dressingroom	47.93025207519531
Twoone here and one there	239.9442901611328
Andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	24.275379180908203
Caderousse became thoughtful	246.63694763183594
Does he often go to Auteuil added he	245.8525848388672
Two or three times a week	167.9254913330078
Tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there	94.10379028320312
Are you sure of it	78.92084503173828
He has invited me to dine there	231.0220184326172
There s a life for you said Caderousse a town house and a country house	139.396728515625
That is what it is to be rich	53.047393798828125
And shall you dine there	220.0242462158203
When you dine there do you sleep there	781.2310791015625
If I like I am at home there	356.3210144042969
Caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart	34.05531311035156
But Andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a Havana quietly lit it and began smoking	375.2638854980469
When do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to Caderousse	14.703558921813965
Now if you have them	189.1106719970703
Andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his pocket	164.288330078125
Yellow boys said Caderousse no I thank you	69.78239440917969
Oh you despise them	127.5159912109375
On the contrary I esteem them but will not have them	128.4973602294922
You can change them idiot gold is worth five sous	111.8797836303711
Exactly and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold	36.03575134277344
No nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them	112.04854583740234
Anybody may possess a fivefranc piece	194.44590759277344
But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me I should want a porter	237.09854125976562
Well leave them with your porter he is to be trusted	160.44427490234375
I will call for them	55.48423767089844
No tomorrow I shall not have time today	31.6142520904541
Well tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil	100.52398681640625
May I depend on it	538.7554931640625
Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it	127.2867202758789
Now see here will that be all Eh And will you not torment me any more	46.98760223388672
Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change	128.53309631347656
He redoubled his gayety and carelessness	56.06887435913086
How sprightly you are said Caderousse One would say you were already in possession of your property	56.06569290161133
No unfortunately but when I do obtain it	46.743045806884766
I shall remember old friends I can tell you that	84.58674621582031
Yes since you have such a good memory	76.91716766357422
What do you want It looks as if you were trying to fleece me	720.6863403320312
I What an idea I who am going to give you another piece of good advice	27.115947723388672
What is it	50.76947021484375
To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger	240.2049560546875
We shall both get into trouble	64.35916137695312
You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly	55.489078521728516
How so said Andrea	168.97781372070312
How You put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs	147.08506774902344
You guess well	83.82976531982422
I know something of diamonds I have had some	40.38147735595703
You do well to boast of it said Andrea who without becoming angry as Caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	104.61412811279297
Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect	707.9295654296875
It is a false diamond said Caderousse	158.48077392578125
You are joking now replied Andrea	122.21746063232422
Do not be angry we can try it	46.400325775146484
Caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut	233.31771850585938
Confiteor said Caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger I was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry paralyzed	575.8580322265625
Have you finished said Andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat Make free now you have begun	29.537302017211914
No you are after all a good companion I will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition	298.2464904785156
But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold	43.363487243652344
I shall not sell itdo not fear	81.32083129882812
Not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man	64.2011489868164
Happy rogue said Caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed	51.60508728027344
Yes said Andrea	33.268310546875
Well I hope you will make a handsome weddingpresent the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars	209.70777893066406
I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head	275.1802673339844
What fortune has she	60.39719009399414
But I tell you	13.472140312194824
A million	118.52666473388672
Andrea shrugged his shoulders	101.06758117675781
Let it be a million said Caderousse you can never have so much as I wish you	121.65422058105469
Thank you said the young man	61.47786331176758
Oh I wish it you with all my heart added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh	177.56573486328125
Stop let me show you the way	61.48524856567383
It is not worthwhile	170.55471801757812
Yes it is	18.80754280090332
Because there is a little secret a precaution I thought it desirable to take one of Huret   Fichets locks revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist	49.2120246887207
Thank you said Andrea I will let you know a week beforehand	42.544029235839844
They parted	61.634517669677734
Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court	90.30440521240234
Then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan Andrea had left him	62.43090057373047
Dear Benedetto said he I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend	257.4156494140625
Chapter 82	46.69569778442383
The Burglary	163.85446166992188
The day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil accompanied by Ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining	37.326839447021484
He was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop	50.73838806152344
The house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea	55.07721710205078
The count praised Bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a month	41.1622428894043
Now said he I may require to go in one night from Paris to Trport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours	300.3959655761719
Your highness had already expressed that wish said Bertuccio and the horses are ready	193.98361206054688
I have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops	34.03475570678711
That s well said Monte Cristo I remain here a day or twoarrange accordingly	1.053364872932434
As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders Baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter	158.85589599609375
What are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust I did not send for you I think	44.88849639892578
Baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter	95.7892074584961
Important and urgent said he	180.87123107910156
The count opened the letter and read	92.72895050048828
de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the Champslyses with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressingroom	31.058856964111328
The counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	83.68415832519531
The count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property himself	134.7906494140625
Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and M	531.8895263671875
de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made	61.95504379272461
The counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	11.960927963256836
He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as Fiesco17 had done over the Moor who would have killed him	273.3008728027344
We know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man	178.6959991455078
From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against God and sometimes against the world that is against the devil	67.83348083496094
They do not want my papers said Monte Cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	18.893617630004883
I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs	16.51580238342285
I am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion	131.95999145507812
The count recalled Baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter	65.95319366455078
Return to Paris said he assemble the servants who remain there	103.64495849609375
I want all my household at Auteuil	125.70047760009766
But will no one remain in the house my lord asked Baptistin	93.5582046508789
Yes the porter	53.47029113769531
My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house	136.34031677246094
The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise	51.754371643066406
By whom	59.65800094604492
By thieves	52.39851760864258
You are a fool M	338.7862548828125
Thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed	35.845306396484375
Baptistin bowed	109.60403442382812
40150 m	148.27883911132812
You understand me said the count	113.50715637207031
Bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor	208.9786834716797
And those of the first floor	3786.45068359375
You know they are never closed	35.009342193603516
The count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but Ali should attend him	52.053794860839844
Having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to Ali to follow him went out by the sidegate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned apparently without design towards Paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the Champslyses	216.79620361328125
All was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as Baptistin had said	69.76100158691406
Monte Cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed	74.92794036865234
Ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	203.88320922851562
He hastened to the sidedoor with Ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant	54.03056335449219
Arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to Ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he examined	208.6832275390625
Everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire	233.5962677001953
He double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in	56.4536018371582
Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled one	1.1982777118682861
Thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands	20.552799224853516
It was about halfpast nine	56.83197784423828
The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	349.93621826171875
He had within his reach his pistols and carbine and Ali standing near him held one of the small Arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the Crusades	66.10391235351562
Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the street	91.34954833984375
Two hours passed thus	109.35043334960938
It was intensely dark still Ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees	103.13543701171875
The little light in the lodge had long been extinct	153.7682647705078
It might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in Monte Cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	314.7175598144531
It would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	4174.99853515625
The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes	39.66416549682617
40152 m	92.72447967529297
As the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressingroom this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect	472.19744873046875
A firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond	142.92115783691406
The count felt his heart beat more rapidly	410.81646728515625
Inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution	56.59977340698242
However Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master	28.478271484375
Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies	242.40390014648438
The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressingroom	191.76092529296875
He fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling	242.79513549804688
Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man entered	182.181640625
He was alone	106.63473510742188
That s a daring rascal whispered the count	127.14453887939453
At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	39.55977249145508
He turned Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street	63.87168502807617
I see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard	39.46513748168945
He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	137.998291015625
The glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	79.08788299560547
At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings	94.78561401367188
There were two doors he bolted them both	62.23461151123047
When he drew near to the bedroom door Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings	70.11577606201172
It was only a precaution	269.2730712890625
The nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security	100.99064636230469
Alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	102.47781372070312
But the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	81.142578125
The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	30.819623947143555
Ah ha whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief	186.56350708007812
But the man in the dark could not find the right key	31.665699005126953
He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	635.5247802734375
By heavens exclaimed Monte Cristo starting back it is	126.67548370361328
Ali raised his hatchet	123.77857971191406
Do nt stir whispered Monte Cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms	9.921432495117188
40154 m	89.26305389404297
Then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	804.663330078125
It was an order the count had just given for immediately Ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered hat	85.21090698242188
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in France where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by King Louis XVI	18.381269454956055
who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	94.81300354003906
The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	37.99676513671875
The man hearing nothing more stood erect and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale	64.20397186279297
Try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work there	83.80842590332031
And he advanced to the window	94.88350677490234
The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the Champslyses or by the Faubourg SaintHonor his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the counts and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressingroom	42.128353118896484
Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to Ali he whispered	42.04365539550781
Remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if I call you	63.872806549072266
Ali bowed in token of strict obedience	64.27178955078125
Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	509.653076171875
The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated	42.46849822998047
He turned	236.0458221435547
Ah goodevening my dear M	126.09381103515625
Caderousse said Monte Cristo what are you doing here at such an hour	90.22722625732422
40156 m	214.1660614013672
The Abb Busoni exclaimed Caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied	154.1936798095703
The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat	13.301420211791992
The Abb Busoni repeated Caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count	55.395416259765625
Yes undoubtedly the Abb Busoni himself replied Monte Cristo	57.020198822021484
And I am very glad you recognize me dear M	99.65921783447266
Caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met	21.742345809936523
This calmness of Busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered Caderousse	51.28567886352539
The abb the abb murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering	1976.528076171875
So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo continued the false abb	95.59121704101562
Reverend sir murmured Caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blockedreverend sir I do nt knowbelieve meI take my oath	84.74992370605469
A pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forcedit is tolerably evident	68.59034729003906
Caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape	75.40262603759766
Come come continued the count I see you are still the samean assassin	77.53943634033203
Reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not Iit was La Carconte that was proved at the trial since I was only condemned to the galleys	65.90349578857422
Is your time then expired since I find you in a fair way to return there	234.45059204101562
No reverend sir I have been liberated by someone	63.09730529785156
That someone has done society a great kindness	168.5443115234375
Ah said Caderousse I had promised	31.007463455200195
And you are breaking your promise interrupted Monte Cristo	123.0294418334961
Alas yes said Caderousse very uneasily	24.438426971435547
A bad relapse that will lead you if I mistake not to the Place de Grve	29.73601722717285
So much the worse so much the worsediavolo as they say in my country	1332.2003173828125
Reverend sir I am impelled	116.34810638427734
Every criminal says the same thing	1.0433721542358398
Pshaw said Busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a bakers door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited	70.70954895019531
And when the jeweller Johannes had just paid you 45000 francs for the diamond I had given you and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both was that also poverty	62.99394989013672
Pardon reverend sir said Caderousse you have saved my life once save me again	55.266841888427734
That is but poor encouragement	70.58084106445312
Are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me	48.26777267456055
I am alone said the abb and I will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth	12.356902122497559
Ah reverend sir cried Caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo I may indeed say you are my deliverer	166.72915649414062
You mean to say you have been freed from confinement	864.9019165039062
Yes that is true reverend sir	73.93321228027344
Who was your liberator	40.963504791259766
An Englishman	15.245038986206055
What was his name	532.541015625
Lord Wilmore	244.34925842285156
I know him I shall know if you lie	806.6983642578125
Ah reverend sir I tell you the simple truth	528.5804443359375
Was this Englishman protecting you	83.29734802246094
No not me but a young Corsican my companion	4465.72607421875
What was this young Corsicans name	71.08507537841797
Is that his Christian name	83.5650863647461
He had no other he was a foundling	169.22915649414062
Then this young man escaped with you	35.99537658691406
He did	218.99118041992188
In what way	132.73728942871094
We were working at SaintMandrier near Toulon	226.1095428466797
Do you know SaintMandrier	28.63630485534668
I do	121.21726989746094
In the hour of rest between noon and one oclock	125.85665130615234
Galleyslaves having a nap after dinner We may well pity the poor fellows said the abb	30.418682098388672
Nay said Caderousse one ca nt always workone is not a dog	91.83314514160156
So much the better for the dogs said Monte Cristo	11.027017593383789
While the rest slept then we went away a short distance we severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us and swam away	36.915260314941406
And what is become of this Benedetto	86.15423583984375
I do nt know	175.8458251953125
You ought to know	87.28771209716797
No in truth we parted at Hyres	74.93505096435547
And to give more weight to his protestation Caderousse advanced another step towards the abb who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation	114.1367416381836
You lie said the Abb Busoni with a tone of irresistible authority	71.82433319091797
Reverend sir	96.96465301513672
You lie This man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice	423.31121826171875
40160 m	68.4749526977539
Oh reverend sir	35.3405647277832
Since you left Toulon what have you lived on Answer me	56.25094223022461
On what I could get	1414.8095703125
You lie repeated the abb a third time with a still more imperative tone	99.1966781616211
Caderousse terrified looked at the count	69.84395599365234
You have lived on the money he has given you	109.79517364501953
True said Caderousse Benedetto has become the son of a great lord	150.80784606933594
How can he be the son of a great lord	161.19102478027344
A natural son	46.138187408447266
And what is that great lords name	97.90673828125
The Count of Monte Cristo the very same in whose house we are	68.92062377929688
Benedetto the counts son replied Monte Cristo astonished in his turn	101.32936096191406
Well I should think so since the count has found him a false fathersince the count gives him four thousand francs a month and leaves him 500000 francs in his will	34.166526794433594
Ah yes said the factitious abb who began to understand and what name does the young man bear meanwhile	102.45279693603516
Andrea Cavalcanti	88.11871337890625
Is it then that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo has received into his house and who is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	8200.0546875
And you suffer that you wretchyou who know his life and his crime	49.425567626953125
Why should I stand in a comrades way said Caderousse	56.75522994995117
You are right it is not you who should apprise M	60.59008026123047
Danglars it is I	44.15980911254883
Do not do so reverend sir	162.8326416015625
Why not	115.31751251220703
Because you would bring us to ruin	156.94296264648438
And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes	141.75485229492188
Reverend sir said Caderousse drawing still nearer	397.4148254394531
I will expose all	87.61739349365234
To whom	100.95011138916016
To M	77.27198791503906
By Heaven cried Caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir	59.0736198425293
To Caderousses great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the counts breast flew back blunted	14.258111953735352
At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain	75.90174865722656
But the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandits wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor	313.5046691894531
The count then placed his foot on his head saying I know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal	63.79011154174805
Ah mercymercy cried Caderousse	27.941526412963867
The count withdrew his foot	18.502159118652344
40162 m	31.574644088745117
Rise said he	263.5855712890625
Caderousse rose	162.68765258789062
What a wrist you have reverend sir said Caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist	12.398550033569336
Silence God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that God I actremember that wretchand to spare thee at this moment is still serving him	92.00627899169922
Oh said Caderousse groaning with pain	115.05715942382812
Take this pen and paper and write what I dictate	73.63127899169922
I do nt know how to write reverend sir	58.68040466308594
You lie Take this pen and write	68.1358413696289
Caderousse awed by the superior power of the abb sat down and wrote	183.09303283691406
SirThe man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at Toulon	75.11575317382812
He was No	425.1175842285156
59 and I No	74.67932891845703
He was called Benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents	9.532882690429688
Sign it continued the count	89.30123901367188
But would you ruin me	19.504596710205078
If I sought your ruin fool I should drag you to the first guardhouse besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear	48.453575134277344
Sign it then	38.15988540649414
Caderousse signed it	211.1522979736328
The address To monsieur the Baron Danglars banker Rue de la Chausse dAntin	46.917694091796875
Caderousse wrote the address	110.41400909423828
The abb took the note	229.8812713623047
Now said he that sufficesbegone	91.05976867675781
Which way	98.29364013671875
The way you came	183.9564971923828
You wish me to get out at that window	32.19434356689453
You got in very well	64.10112762451172
Oh you have some design against me reverend sir	38.141395568847656
Idiot what design can I have	366.6667175292969
Why then not let me out by the door	116.1086196899414
What would be the advantage of waking the porter	84.06538391113281
Ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead	394.5071716308594
I wish what God wills	9.711212158203125
But swear that you will not strike me as I go down	114.55986785888672
Cowardly fool	37.6526985168457
What do you intend doing with me	144.14523315429688
I ask you what can I do I have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer	55.91010284423828
Oh monsieur said Caderousse make one more attempttry me once more	1.0699710845947266
I will said the count	268.51953125
Listenyou know if I may be relied on	31.052392959594727
Yes said Caderousse	36.77988052368164
If you arrive safely at home	75.4925308227539
What have I to fear except from you	70.58063507080078
If you reach your home safely leave Paris leave France and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well I will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then	178.83726501464844
Then asked Caderousse shuddering	169.30760192871094
40164 m	55.45157241821289
Then I shall believe God has forgiven you and I will forgive you too	43.11562728881836
As true as I am a Christian stammered Caderousse you will make me die of fright	89.07218170166016
Now begone said the count pointing to the window	129.37619018554688
Caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	566.1578369140625
Now go down said the abb folding his arms	62.20224380493164
Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him Caderousse began to go down	44.04882049560547
Then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the Champslyses that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light	315.69512939453125
What are you doing reverend sir Suppose a watchman should pass And he blew out the light	169.6207275390625
He then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety	87.79061126708984
Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first Caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	393.974609375
The count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over	23.876745223999023
Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet	41.6541748046875
No one could be seen or heard	100.66356658935547
The clock of the Invalides struck one	147.53941345214844
Then Caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise	103.89697265625
But once started he could not stop	102.79945373535156
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downin vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground	363.4248962402344
Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying Help A second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling Help murder Then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest	113.86592102050781
This time Caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	37.29201126098633
The assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	71.03742980957031
The murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared	104.85234832763672
Then Caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort	1.1068811416625977
Murder I am dying Help reverend sirhelp	55.439727783203125
This mournful appeal pierced the darkness	126.44049072265625
The door of the backstaircase opened then the sidegate of the garden and Ali and his master were on the spot with lights	84.39179229736328
Chapter 83	198.42666625976562
The Hand of God	54.34537124633789
Caderousse continued to call piteously Help reverend sir help	63.484779357910156
What is the matter asked Monte Cristo	57.7591667175293
Help cried Caderousse I am murdered	147.45339965820312
We are heretake courage	58.708839416503906
Ah its all over You are come too lateyou are come to see me die	215.20643615722656
What blows what blood	206.3365020751953
He fainted	105.95777893066406
Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room	91.97772216796875
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds	128.40126037597656
My God he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually	80.283447265625
Ali looked at his master for further instructions	62.61744689941406
Bring here immediately the kings attorney M	66.49567413330078
de Villefort who lives in the Faubourg SaintHonor	200.53114318847656
As you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon	16.183502197265625
Ali obeyed leaving the abb alone with Caderousse who had not yet revived	1.0454856157302856
When the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	189.37841796875
A surgeon reverend sira surgeon said Caderousse	64.70230865478516
I have sent for one replied the abb	366.9814147949219
I know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence	264.9092102050781
Against whom	128.18568420410156
Against my murderer	89.98867797851562
Did you recognize him	164.7666778564453
Yes it was Benedetto	174.47854614257812
The young Corsican	45.948551177978516
Your comrade	196.27931213378906
After giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping I should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and I should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me	199.22105407714844
I have also sent for the procureur	36.10693359375
He will not come in time I feel my life fast ebbing	163.3714599609375
Wait a moment said Monte Cristo	232.85104370117188
He left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	99.43692779541016
The dying mans eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive	62.10142517089844
Hasten reverend sir hasten I shall faint again Monte Cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial	27.032310485839844
Caderousse drew a deep breath	86.80610656738281
Oh said he that is life to me more more	285.4019775390625
Two drops more would kill you replied the abb	1.0454856157302856
Oh send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch	78.79491424560547
Shall I write your deposition You can sign it	104.07369232177734
Yes yes said Caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	54.63489532470703
Monte Cristo wrote	238.50869750976562
I die murdered by the Corsican Benedetto my comrade in the galleys at Toulon No	55.841041564941406
Quick quick said Caderousse or I shall be unable to sign it	93.77039337158203
Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying	59.31755447387695
You will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti	101.89728546142578
He lodges at the Htel des Princes	163.91070556640625
Oh I am dying He again fainted	92.29166412353516
The abb made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	33.84368133544922
His desire for revenge had not forsaken him	30.07752799987793
Ah you will tell all I have said will you not reverend sir	123.4594497680664
Yes and much more	4.322817802429199
What more will you say	107.9884262084961
I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	77.4898681640625
I will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent I read the note and sat up to await you	38.25856399536133
And he will be guillotined will he not said Caderousse	20.568382263183594
Promise me that and I will die with that hope	77.75970458984375
I will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself	24.342111587524414
Did you see all that	42.94655227661133
Remember my words If you return home safely I shall believe God has forgiven you and I will forgive you also	84.20692443847656
And you did not warn me cried Caderousse raising himself on his elbows	57.65553665161133
You knew I should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me	84.47408294677734
40168 m	58.77508544921875
No for I saw Gods justice placed in the hands of Benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of Providence	65.09756469726562
Gods justice Speak not of it reverend sir	27.63226318359375
If God were just you know how many would be punished who now escape	224.7754669189453
Patience said the abb in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience	74.1475830078125
Caderousse looked at him with amazement	55.6727180480957
Besides said the abb God is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge	3595.40966796875
Do you then believe in God said Caderousse	46.22842025756836
Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said Monte Cristo I must believe on seeing you	121.1977310180664
Caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven	104.91646575927734
Listen said the abb extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him to believe this is what the God in whom on your deathbed you refuse to believe has done for youhe gave you health strength regular employment even friendsa life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience	105.9950180053711
Instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your courseyou have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend	88.99203491210938
Help cried Caderousse I require a surgeon not a priest perhaps I am not mortally woundedI may not die perhaps they can yet save my life	16.183502197265625
Your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops I gave you you would now be dead	12.998472213745117
Listen then	129.71041870117188
Ah murmured Caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them	32.343135833740234
Listen continued the abb	99.62748718261719
When you had betrayed your friend God began not to strike but to warn you	44.51784896850586
Poverty overtook you	101.49799346923828
You had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when God worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	58.0454216003418
But this unexpected unhopedfor unheardof fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and howby a murder You succeeded and then God snatched it from you and brought you to justice	130.09613037109375
It was not I who wished to kill the Jew said Caderousse it was La Carconte	127.8454360961914
Yes said Monte Cristo and GodI can not say in justice for his justice would have slain youbut God in his mercy spared your life	91.10415649414062
Pardieu to transport me for life how merciful	87.89348602294922
You thought it a mercy then miserable wretch The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galleyslaves you said I may escape from prison I can not from the grave	139.6822509765625
And you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly	23.887882232666016
An Englishman visited Toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion	91.4508285522461
You received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	85.03510284423828
Then wretched creature then you tempted God a third time	253.22994995117188
I have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse	95.1329116821289
God is wearied he has punished you	300.86041259765625
Caderousse was fast sinking	180.96681213378906
Give me drink said he I thirstI burn Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water	54.59151077270508
And yet that villain Benedetto will escape	138.2416534423828
No one I tell you will escape Benedetto will be punished	90.77766418457031
Then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priestyou should have prevented Benedetto from killing me	65.18817138671875
I said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and penitent I might have prevented Benedetto from killing you but I found you proud and bloodthirsty and I left you in the hands of God	1001.746337890625
I do not believe there is a God howled Caderousse you do not believe it you lieyou lie	44.7116813659668
Silence said the abb you will force the last drop of blood from your veins	134.785888671875
What you do not believe in God when he is striking you dead you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive God who might have directed the assassins dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance	45.699974060058594
Reflect then wretched man and repent	22.879186630249023
No said Caderousse no I will not repent	215.72447204589844
There is no God there is no Providenceall comes by chance	106.88550567626953
There is a Providence there is a God said Monte Cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while I stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that God in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him	146.3557891845703
But who are you then asked Caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	121.27931213378906
Look well at me said Monte Cristo putting the light near his face	1.0454856157302856
Well the abbthe Abb Busoni	64.10870361328125
Monte Cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features	87.28092193603516
Oh said Caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair I should say you were the Englishman Lord Wilmore	27.49395179748535
I am neither the Abb Busoni nor Lord Wilmore said Monte Cristo think againdo you not recollect me	4.976109027862549
There was a magic effect in the counts words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man	68.83772277832031
Yes indeed said he I think I have seen you and known you formerly	264.9888000488281
Yes Caderousse you have seen me you knew me once	37.266292572021484
Who then are you and why if you knew me do you let me die	22.411375045776367
Because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	53.95353317260742
Had it been possible to save you I should have considered it another proof of Gods mercy and I would again have endeavored to restore you I swear by my fathers tomb	45.31953048706055
By your fathers tomb said Caderousse supported by a supernatural power and halfraising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you	133.4433135986328
The count had watched the approach of death	75.77821350097656
He knew this was the last struggle	89.38904571533203
He approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered I amI am	39.88246154785156
And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it	83.91063690185547
Caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort Oh my God my God said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed mans father in heaven and his judge on earth	42.1408805847168
My God my Lord I have long despised thee Pardon me my God receive me Oh my Lord	62.14751434326172
Caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan	5.601236343383789
The blood no longer flowed from his wounds	123.67598724365234
He was dead	129.65396118164062
One said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	6252.26904296875
Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by Ali and were received by the Abb Busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse	236.60182189941406
Chapter 84	104.85633850097656
The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight	69.81938171386719
The dying man had signed a deposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin	157.7213897705078
The police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer	145.88861083984375
Caderousses knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue	127.35017395019531
The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the Abb Busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library	110.52310180664062
Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedettos name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so	110.04334259033203
Villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	162.60452270507812
But three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti	75.8330078125
It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed	30.845993041992188
Letters had been despatched to M	44.071983337402344
Cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres	1.606662392616272
It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future fatherinlaw who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron	112.5348892211914
The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti not so Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars	56.933692932128906
With an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered Andreas attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf but when Andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	174.4013671875
The baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance	47.43174743652344
The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired	150.69642639160156
Morcerf appreciated the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord	31.745054244995117
No one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers	49.19978713989258
Albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	520.7979125976562
Besides the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	1.0454856157302856
He cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds	53.61183547973633
Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days	30.196624755859375
Where he was no one knew	53.80424118041992
One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced Beauchamp	67.32716369628906
Albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smokingroom on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down	292.4068908691406
He found Beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped	84.5425033569336
Your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said Albert	54.662593841552734
Tell me may I shake hands with you saying Beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms	29.94940948486328
Albert said Beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk	50.09836196899414
Rather sir before we sit down I must demand your answer	177.47540283203125
Albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer	55.620235443115234
I will facilitate it by repeating the question Will you or will you not retract	207.8083038330078
Morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as Lieutenantgnral the Count of Morcerf peer of France	86.20510864257812
What must then be done	51.553794860839844
40174 m	88.78265380859375
What I have done Albert	37.725215911865234
I reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	46.82933807373047
If I strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years I have been on terms of intimacy I must at least know why I do so I must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life	223.9192352294922
Well said Morcerf impatiently what does all this mean	98.34693908691406
It means that I have just returned from Yanina	1.1138991117477417
From Yanina	52.79720687866211
Here is my passport examine the visaGeneva Milan Venice Trieste Delvino Yanina	52.715023040771484
Will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire Albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp	10.036722183227539
You have been to Yanina said he	56.63678741455078
Albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom I killed to get rid of I should not have taken this trouble but I thought this mark of consideration due to you	70.845703125
I took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and fortyeight hours to stay there that makes three weeks	23.400344848632812
I returned last night and here I am	1.0454856157302856
What circumlocution How long you are before you tell me what I most wish to know	173.66238403320312
Because in truth Albert	73.42350769042969
You hesitate	51.37997817993164
YesI fear	129.58746337890625
You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you Oh no selflove Beauchamp	106.25482177734375
Acknowledge it Beauchamp your courage can not be doubted	27.922138214111328
Not so murmured the journalist on the contrary	117.2632064819336
Albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips	134.4803009033203
My friend said Beauchamp in the most affectionate tone I should gladly make an apology but alas	42.29600524902344
But what	58.26732635498047
The paragraph was correct my friend	29.788732528686523
What That French officer	108.58465576171875
The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was	71.89208221435547
Pardon me my friend that man was your father	93.02789306640625
Albert advanced furiously towards Beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand	97.158203125
My friend said he here is a proof of it	262.1322326660156
40176 m	125.05206298828125
Albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of Yanina proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego in the service of Ali Tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	180.54525756835938
The signatures were perfectly legal	61.04701232910156
Albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	661.8591918945312
It could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given	118.38601684570312
After a moments mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	112.08995819091797
Beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young mans paroxysm of grief approached him	74.26332092285156
Now Albert said he you understand medo you not I wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your fathers favor and that I might do him justice	172.36534118652344
But on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that Fernand Mondego raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governorgeneral is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship I hastened to you	191.80308532714844
Albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him	122.80157470703125
I hastened to you continued Beauchamp to tell you Albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children	58.17596435546875
Few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	212.5063018798828
Now I have these proofs Albert and I am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but I come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me	64.76781463623047
Do you wish these proofs these attestations which I alone possess to be destroyed Do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us Confided to me it shall never escape my lips say Albert my friend do you wish it	165.62228393554688
Albert threw himself on Beauchamps neck	95.60987091064453
Ah noble fellow cried he	34.61605453491211
Take these said Beauchamp presenting the papers to Albert	62.24755096435547
Albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the waxlight always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	268.2546081542969
Dear excellent friend murmured Albert still burning the papers	75.88288879394531
Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said Beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes	44.325164794921875
Yes yes said Albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which I promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that I owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh Beauchamp I should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother I could not have killed her by the same blowI should have fled from my country	57.53214645385742
Dear Albert said Beauchamp	239.14483642578125
But this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief	133.1871795654297
Well said Beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend	55.12319564819336
40178 m	141.1877899169922
I am brokenhearted said Albert	81.79450988769531
Listen Beauchamp I can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a fathers untarnished name inspires a son	16.34785270690918
Oh Beauchamp Beauchamp how shall I now approach mine Shall I draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his I am the most wretched of men	121.57743072509766
Ah my mother my poor mother said Albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer	9.247721672058105
Come said Beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend	125.27354431152344
But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal Some unknown enemyan invisible foehas done this	376.5864562988281
The more must you fortify yourself Albert	85.80824279785156
Let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and deatha fatal secret known only when the storm bursts	338.1008605957031
Go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come	108.25636291503906
40179 m	125.81632995605469
You think then all is not over yet said Albert horrorstricken	47.46802520751953
I think nothing my friend but all things are possible	86.41706085205078
By the way	83.84259796142578
What said Albert seeing that Beauchamp hesitated	101.42755126953125
Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	40.40536117553711
Why do you ask me now	74.55416107177734
Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking	67.88146209716797
How said Albert whose brow reddened you think M	84.28445434570312
I ask you only how your engagement stands Pray put no construction on my words I do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight	41.17214584350586
said Albert the engagement is broken off	52.34382629394531
Well said Beauchamp	28.688766479492188
Then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy Let us go out Albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and I to mine	34.741676330566406
Willingly said Albert but let us walk	202.79261779785156
I think a little exertion would do me good	40.51432800292969
The two friends walked out on the fortress	49.60579299926758
When they arrived at the Madeleine	25.124814987182617
Since we are out said Beauchamp let us call on M	49.87501525878906
de Monte Cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters	83.07415008544922
Gladly said Albert let us callI love him	61.458457946777344
Chapter 85	3003.816650390625
The Journey	4706.134765625
Monte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together	111.01732635498047
Ah ha said he I hope all is over explained and settled	145.7790985107422
Yes said Beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed I would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it	191.9690704345703
Albert will tell you replied the count that I gave him the same advice	45.703651428222656
Look added he	134.7125701904297
I am finishing the most execrable mornings work	76.92295837402344
What is it said Albert arranging your papers apparently	56.19955062866211
My papers thank God nomy papers are all in capital order because I have none but M	85.36104583740234
Cavalcantis asked Beauchamp	142.6089630126953
Yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said Morcerf	759.571044921875
Let us not misunderstand each other replied Monte Cristo I introduce no one and certainly not M	192.7261199951172
And who said Albert with a forced smile is to marry Mademoiselle Danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly	177.96327209472656
What Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars asked Beauchamp	568.9553833007812
Certainly do you come from the end of the world said Monte Cristo you a journalist the husband of renown It is the talk of all Paris	138.6151885986328
And you count have made this match asked Beauchamp	159.2245330810547
I Silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report	87.6305923461914
I make a match No you do not know me I have done all in my power to oppose it	20.900169372558594
Ah I understand said Beauchamp on our friend Alberts account	81.73847961425781
On my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that I have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended	135.2527313232422
The count pretends I have not him to thankso be itI will erect an altar Deo ignoto	71.91888427734375
Listen said Monte Cristo I have had little to do with it for I am at variance both with the fatherinlaw and the young man there is only Mademoiselle Eugnie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me	64.13089752197266
And do you say this wedding is at hand	258.87628173828125
Oh yes in spite of all I could say	36.711177825927734
I do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but I never trust to vague assertions	76.142333984375
I have warned M	41.87456130981445
Danglars of it till I am tired but he is fascinated with his Luccanese	69.82281494140625
I have even informed him of a circumstance I consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor I scarcely know which	47.830745697021484
But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years God only knows	80.99247741699219
Well all that was useless	53.167816162109375
They have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are	149.1494140625
I send them but like Pilatewashing my hands	113.64786529541016
And what does Mademoiselle dArmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil	221.36041259765625
Oh well I do nt know but I understand that she is going to Italy	97.75289154052734
Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre who is under some obligation to me	59.827674865722656
But what is the matter Albert you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle Eugnie	156.74551391601562
I am not aware of it said Albert smiling sorrowfully	1.0451560020446777
Beauchamp turned to look at some paintings	155.42332458496094
But continued Monte Cristo you are not in your usual spirits	35.696922302246094
I have a dreadful headache said Albert	48.20724105834961
Well my dear viscount said Monte Cristo I have an infallible remedy to propose to you	19.965421676635742
What is that asked the young man	54.63622283935547
A change	58.362483978271484
Indeed said Albert	42.22319793701172
Yes and as I am just now excessively annoyed I shall go from home	27.932817459106445
Shall we go together	30.803630828857422
You annoyed count said Beauchamp and by what	107.47323608398438
Ah you think very lightly of it I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house	100.10253143310547
What brief	379.93096923828125
The one M	93.10448455810547
de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinsome brigand escaped from the gallows apparently	274.1471862792969
True said Beauchamp I saw it in the paper	80.319091796875
Who is this Caderousse	53.188507080078125
Some Provenal it appears	55.148799896240234
de Villefort heard of him at Marseilles and M	28.143817901611328
Danglars recollects having seen him	93.11932373046875
Consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which I am very grateful they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being Caderousses murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in France will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends	96.8187026977539
I am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount	127.9381332397461
Then it is settled	38.08079147338867
Yes but where	29.774991989135742
I have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature	29.395517349243164
I love that humiliation I who am master of the universe as was Augustus	49.11509704589844
But where are you really going	81.27497100830078
To sea viscount you know I am a sailor	40.05019760131836
I was rocked when an infant in the arms of old Ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite I have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other I love the sea as a mistress and pine if I do not often see her	457.75811767578125
Let us go count	131.30738830566406
To sea	47.94578552246094
You accept my proposal	510.7756652832031
I do	115.99799346923828
Well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four posthorses in which one may rest as in a bed	91.3012466430664
Beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us	102.48127746582031
Thank you I have just returned from sea	87.66307067871094
What you have been to sea	65.72093963623047
Yes I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands18	392.57733154296875
What of that come with us said Albert	787.9119873046875
No dear Morcerf you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible	261.538330078125
Besides it is important added he in a low tone that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the paper	17.160112380981445
Ah you are a good and an excellent friend said Albert yes you are right watch watch Beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure	272.1123352050781
Albert and Beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger	112.47518157958984
Beauchamp is a worthy fellow said Monte Cristo when the journalist was gone is he not Albert	53.014835357666016
Yes and a sincere friend I love him devotedly	98.95946502685547
But now we are alonealthough it is immaterial to mewhere are we going	81.44361877441406
Into Normandy if you like	335.7928466796875
Delightful shall we be quite retired have no society no neighbors	423.0660095214844
Our companions will be ridinghorses dogs to hunt with and a fishingboat	6603.10791015625
Exactly what I wish for I will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you	76.93638610839844
But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy	153.56637573242188
I may go where I please	69.04212951660156
Yes I am aware you may go alone since I once met you in Italybut to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo	126.37895202636719
You forget count that I have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you	165.96023559570312
Woman is fickle	22.56254768371582
said Francis I	31.87109375
woman is like a wave of the sea said Shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature well	49.82353973388672
Womans yes my mother is not woman but a woman	17.10835838317871
As I am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if I do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language	39.90635299682617
What I mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes	155.49456787109375
Ah yes indeed said Monte Cristo with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me	266.01123046875
I repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when I am with her she speaks of no one else	126.92362213134766
And does she try to make you dislike me	1266.73193359375
On the contrary she often says Morcerf I believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his esteem	174.5912322998047
Indeed said Monte Cristo sighing	227.69503784179688
You see then said Albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me	442.4878234863281
Adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one	96.37495422363281
At Trport	26.584915161132812
Yes or in the neighborhood	290.02679443359375
But can we travel fortyeight leagues in eight hours	132.6551513671875
Easily said Monte Cristo	101.89649963378906
You are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in France but even the telegraph	6.462138652801514
But viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting	50.12285614013672
Do not fear I have little to prepare	22.87055206298828
Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation	51.60744857788086
But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered	10.35521125793457
Bertuccio said he I intend going this evening to Normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day	80.94749450683594
You will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station	91.42449188232422
de Morcerf will accompany me	17.209300994873047
Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	48.30772018432617
From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready	152.5514678955078
Before his departure the count went to Haydes apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care	47.522029876708984
Albert was punctual	374.25494384765625
The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which Morcerf had formed no previous idea	32.8525276184082
Truly said Monte Cristo with your posthorses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or illtempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses do I not Ali	11.027017593383789
The count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly	29.964168548583984
The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor	59.698150634765625
Ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze	44.31511688232422
This child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane	74.48767852783203
I never knew till now the delight of speed said Morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses Are they made to order	50.16164779663086
Precisely said the count six years since I bought a horse in Hungary remarkable for its swiftness	89.47261810302734
The thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead	40.20117950439453
That is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses	33.32748031616211
You see I travel with them	39.16160202026367
But you are not always travelling	244.23614501953125
When I no longer require them Bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale	201.02401733398438
But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them	59.788604736328125
Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects	194.0512237548828
Count may I suggest one idea to you	48.329227447509766
It is that next to you Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in Europe	115.16973876953125
You are mistaken viscount I believe he has not a franc in his possession	105.99820709228516
Then he must be a wonder	260.1824645996094
My dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things I warn you I shall not believe them	21.935291290283203
I countenance nothing that is marvellous M	115.84461975097656
Tell me why does a steward rob his master	114.33262634277344
Because I suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing	229.9404754638672
You are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them	131.3842315673828
Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future	84.88165283203125
Now M	82.07212829589844
Bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service	55.9154052734375
Because I should never get a better	26.04080581665039
Probabilities are deceptive	170.14523315429688
But I deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death	78.1931381225586
Do you possess that right over Bertuccio	75.95344543457031
There are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes	24.804929733276367
The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours	1.0454856157302856
At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park	43.63613510131836
The porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach	4.083975315093994
At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared	95.64301300048828
The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him Baptistin who rode in front attended the count	77.76924133300781
Albert bathed took his supper and went to bed	55.764408111572266
All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf	35.72239303588867
On rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	158.04563903808594
In a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled Calvary the mount rendered by our Lords passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personages past life	463.6960754394531
Around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen	103.44173431396484
There as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	36.92230987548828
Albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the Englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for fishing	255.14195251464844
The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled	41.97718811035156
They killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summerhouse overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library	185.26504516601562
Towards the evening of the third day	75.05366516113281
Albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up	51.26342010498047
He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo	22.963552474975586
40188 m	225.620361328125
Florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill And he hastened to the door	155.568359375
Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter	86.23467254638672
From whom is this said he eagerly	83.89382934570312
From M	74.19883728027344
Beauchamp replied Florentin	4.629002094268799
Did he send you	207.8031463623047
Yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you I have come in fifteen hours	47.09543991088867
Albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper	12.921100616455078
His sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him	28.947919845581055
Poor young man said Monte Cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation	51.57783889770508
Meanwhile Albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying	221.09341430664062
Florentin is your horse fit to return immediately	113.4591064453125
It is a poor lame posthorse	83.51390075683594
In what state was the house when you left	263.5509948730469
All was quiet but on returning from M	64.4108657836914
Beauchamps I found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	104.98152160644531
I told her my orders from M	134.0505828857422
Beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection Yes go Florentin said she and may he come quickly	58.4759407043457
Yes my mother said Albert I will return and woe to the infamous wretch But first of all I must get there	84.73178100585938
He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo	30.910409927368164
Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance	125.74699401855469
His voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken man	172.93190002441406
Count said he I thank you for your hospitality which I would gladly have enjoyed longer but I must return to Paris	54.95271682739258
What has happened	363.481201171875
A great misfortune more important to me than life	1108.61328125
Do nt question me I beg of you but lend me a horse	89.56709289550781
My stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback	1.139851450920105
Take a postchaise or a carriage	26.806703567504883
No it would delay me and I need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me good	60.476070404052734
Albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door	38.4339714050293
Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling	57.74470520019531
Ali a horse for M	32.015438079833984
de Morcerfquick he is in a hurry	59.1810417175293
40190 m	156.8628387451172
These words restored Albert he darted from the room followed by the count	106.52389526367188
Thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	20.528162002563477
Return as soon as you can Florentin	178.9384307861328
Must I use any password to procure a horse	233.87611389160156
Only dismount another will be immediately saddled	63.64381790161133
Albert hesitated a moment	51.7896614074707
You may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one	21.059873580932617
Read that said he when I am gone that you may not be witness of my anger	18.155338287353516
While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	57.51502990722656
The count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows	32.4410514831543
The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina alluded to three weeks since in lImpartial who not only surrendered the castle of Yanina but sold his benefactor to the Turks styled himself truly at that time Fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family name	53.216033935546875
He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf and ranks among the peers	235.8833465576172
Thus the terrible secret which Beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after Alberts departure for Normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	100.69933319091797
Chapter 86	34.32331848144531
The Trial	7.488125801086426
At eight oclock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamps door	72.47230529785156
The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	47.8308219909668
Beauchamp was in his bath	171.95701599121094
Here I am Albert said	29.24759292602539
Well my poor friend replied Beauchamp I expected you	80.29419708251953
I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	73.85108184814453
Your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	93.88919067382812
So without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds	116.92953491210938
I think I have some clew	136.53802490234375
But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot	500.97662353515625
Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	92.076416015625
Two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides   lImpartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper	250.95263671875
Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph	120.49276733398438
He sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	59.52919006347656
Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper Beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate friend	111.23617553710938
The editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beetsugar probably a composition of his own	588.2446899414062
Ah pardieu said Beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend I need not tell you the cause of my visit	382.6773376464844
Are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper	304.5182189941406
No replied Beauchamp I have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me	180.8253631591797
What is it	203.18617248535156
The article relative to Morcerf	63.58893966674805
Indeed Is it not a curious affair	102.30360412597656
So curious that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character	28.305036544799805
Not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure M	57.6630973815918
de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them	93.5052261352539
Beauchamp was thunderstruck	73.29984283447266
Who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M	80.70722961425781
de Morcerf as he is a peer of France and we are of the opposition	256.8918151855469
Oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	938.7763671875
This news was brought to us	164.0937042236328
A man arrived yesterday from Yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper	27.34862518310547
Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcerf	51.87703323364258
But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	102.60621643066406
Everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues	53.35207748413086
Some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more	88.86333465576172
The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues	160.8217315673828
Like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	99.20868682861328
The true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him	72.54429626464844
He was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of God once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry	152.13356018066406
The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news	5.73397970199585
He did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse	89.6740951538086
He arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the doorkeepers or the coolness of his colleagues	27.830228805541992
40194 m	61.0242805480957
Business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	29.19309425354004
Everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	214.51426696777344
At length an honorable peer Morcerfs acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived	59.4085578918457
There was an impressive silence Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	448.16790771484375
The count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the House but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	100.92993927001953
Moral wounds have this peculiaritythey may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart	56.63838577270508
The article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks	1.0454856157302856
He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of M	1.1927592754364014
de Morcerf and that of the whole House he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	198.61268615722656
He concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore M	22.6767635345459
de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	65.16216278076172
Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly	69.55633544921875
This timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred	55.60935974121094
The president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place	34.872703552246094
The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	53.50554275512695
Morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow	73.35226440429688
My lords answered he it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that I must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me	379.4649353027344
Oh that I could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in worth	233.91995239257812
These words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	16.817846298217773
I demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and I will furnish the house with all necessary information	58.47499465942383
What day do you fix asked the president	30.257116317749023
Today I am at your service replied the count	137.91184997558594
The president rang the bell	77.78941345214844
Does the House approve that the examination should take place today	200.38804626464844
40196 m	182.7830047607422
Yes was the unanimous answer	97.12054443359375
A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcerf	35.942138671875
The investigation would begin at eight oclock that evening in the committeeroom and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour	3.918487548828125
Morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen	67.88609313964844
Beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things	68.91385650634766
Albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from Beauchamps confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence	1.5559414625167847
Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative	12.022758483886719
What next asked Albert	102.52693176269531
What next My friend you impose a painful task on me	84.84235382080078
Must you know all	375.2578125
Absolutely and rather from your lips than anothers	44.60967254638672
Muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more	31.78411865234375
Albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	44.385494232177734
He thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	39.49466323852539
Go on said he	125.10633087158203
The evening arrived all Paris was in expectation	95.71076202392578
Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for Brussels and others went to the policeoffice to inquire if he had taken out a passport	94.54803466796875
I used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries	413.6361389160156
He called for me at seven oclock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the doorkeepers to place me in a box	144.4948272705078
I was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place	161.23306274414062
At eight oclock all were in their places and M	47.58150863647461
de Morcerf entered at the last stroke	12.338017463684082
He held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	66.2198486328125
His presence produced a good effect	50.699832916259766
The committee was made up of Liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him	71.49496459960938
Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked	12.211687088012695
At this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the president	61.50281524658203
You are at liberty to speak M	299.2529296875
de Morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence I assure you Albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner	40.36908721923828
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	163.31552124023438
He produced the ring his mark of authority with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem	174.56468200683594
Unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead	86.73778533935547
But said the count so great was Ali Pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care	158.8102264404297
Albert started on hearing these words the history of Hayde recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave	135.06716918945312
And what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired Albert	49.81121063232422
I acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said Beauchamp	890.88671875
Meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on M	50.0289192199707
de Morcerf Count said he you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your careYes sir replied Morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me	70.9451904296875
On my return Vasiliki and her daughter Hayde had disappeared	108.43537902832031
Did you know themMy intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and I had seen them above twenty times	147.41233825683594
Have you any idea what became of themYes sir I heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty	26.769756317138672
I was not rich my life was in constant danger I could not seek them to my great regret	230.2410888671875
The president frowned imperceptibly	183.55580139160156
Gentlemen said he you have heard the Comte de Morcerfs defence	100.75418853759766
Can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedAlas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away I know not where	23.96251106262207
I believe that I alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war	140.43524169921875
I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini which I have placed before you the ring a token of his goodwill which is here and lastly the most convincing proof I can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life	60.08913040161133
A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment Albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been gained	38.47400665283203
It only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed Gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased I presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself	253.39566040039062
He is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague	13.403179168701172
Here is a letter I have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this incident M	58.64448928833008
de Morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	33.998226165771484
The committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	1146.1126708984375
The president read	95.06117248535156
PresidentI can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the LieutenantGeneral the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in Macedonia with important particulars	346.7809753417969
The president paused and the count turned pale	51.55381393432617
The president looked at his auditors	70.59770202636719
Proceed was heard on all sides	53.5693244934082
The president resumed	174.80506896972656
I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha	132.8337860107422
I was present during his last moments	107.7506332397461
I know what is become of Vasiliki and Hayde	237.82696533203125
I am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard	49.726776123046875
I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you	232.65814208984375
And who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	183.03907775878906
We shall know sir replied the president	489.20233154296875
Is the committee willing to hear this witnessYes yes they all said at once	50.80904769897461
The doorkeeper was called	127.20445251464844
Is there anyone in the lobby said the president	53.546363830566406
Yes sir	84.30640411376953
Who is itA woman accompanied by a servant	54.23321533203125
Everyone looked at his neighbor	970.11279296875
Bring her in said the president	2910.625732421875
Five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and I said Beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety	57.806392669677734
Behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her	337.6734313964844
It was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	59.739871978759766
The president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume and was remarkably beautiful	128.6197967529297
Ah said Albert it was she	58.7270393371582
Who told you that	39.8351936340332
Alas I guess it	73.1160888671875
But go on Beauchamp	44.73991775512695
You see I am calm and strong	128.15304565429688
And yet we must be drawing near the disclosure	96.80937957763672
de Morcerf continued Beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	5.751607894897461
Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death	43.047916412353516
To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary matter	52.270469665527344
The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it	27.695270538330078
As for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him	53.181976318359375
Madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event	135.2096405029297
I was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East	12.358739852905273
But allow me to say that you must have been very young then	54.50543975830078
I was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory	45.721622467041016
In what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youOn them depended my fathers life replied she	181.16342163085938
I am Hayde the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his beloved wife	54.201969146728516
40202 m	55.95002746582031
The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly	87.1086654663086
As for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him	71.07389068603516
Madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last Can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated	18.865453720092773
I can sir said Hayde drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mothers faiththis latter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant ElKobbir by the French officer who in his infamous bargain with the Porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	48.69552993774414
A greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence	54.15302658081055
Hayde still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in Arabic	45.28466796875
It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian Romaic or Turkish language and the interpreter of the House was in attendance	46.06264877319336
One of the noble peers who was familiar with the Arabic language having studied it during the famous Egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud	49.869258880615234
I ElKobbir a slavemerchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the French lord the Count of Monte Cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs as the ransom of a young Christian slave of eleven years of age named Hayde the acknowledged daughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his favorite she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at Constantinople by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali Tepelini named Fernand Mondego	93.22478485107422
The abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate I had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	18.66786003112793
Given at Constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the Hegira	189.3224334716797
Signed ElKobbir	15.84479808807373
That this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it	71.11103820800781
Near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor	74.36062622070312
A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on Hayde seemed one of fire and blood	86.11714172363281
Madame said the president may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo who is now I believe in Paris	19.58555030822754
Sir replied Hayde the Count of Monte Cristo my fosterfather has been in Normandy the last three days	102.57279968261719
Who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunesSir replied Hayde I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief	78.78417205810547
Although a Christian may God forgive me I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father	100.69400787353516
Since I set my foot in France and knew the traitor lived in Paris I have watched carefully	1.1465893983840942
I live retired in the house of my noble protector but I do it from choice	141.28126525878906
I love retirement and silence because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	98.41064453125
But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world	83.35765838623047
I learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance I see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others I learned what had transpired this morning in the House of Peers and what was to take place this evening then I wrote	42.05177307128906
40204 m	101.6969985961914
Then remarked the president the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingsHe is quite unaware of them and I have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what I have done	18.644638061523438
But it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father	51.53022003173828
The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	85.09083557128906
His colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	48.356563568115234
His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance	40.36016845703125
de Morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of YaninaNo said Morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies	81.26811218261719
Hayde whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked You do not know me said she	200.49530029296875
Well I fortunately recognize you You are Fernand Mondego the French officer who led the troops of my noble father It is you who surrendered the castle of Yanina It is you who sent by him to Constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon It is you who with that mandate obtained the pashas ring which gave you authority over Selim the firekeeper It is you who stabbed Selim	44.35589599609375
It is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant ElKobbir Assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your masters blood Look gentlemen all	79.25054931640625
These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the counts forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt Alis blood still lingering there	110.16934967041016
You positively recognize M	37.27037048339844
de Morcerf as the officer Fernand MondegoIndeed I do cried Hayde	243.06724548339844
Oh my mother it was you who said You were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen	439.1513366699219
Look well at that man it is he who raised your fathers head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us Look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant ElKobbir I know him Ah let him say now if he does not recognize me Each word fell like a dagger on Morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair	336.18841552734375
This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count	118.66419982910156
Count of Morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	52.64054870605469
The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself	120.89615631103516
Shall further inquiries be made Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina Speak Morcerf did not reply	83.4471435546875
Then all the members looked at each other with terror	72.66830444335938
They knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	105.3043441772461
They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst	117.60574340820312
Well asked the president what is your decision	25.013761520385742
40206 m	78.63689422607422
I have no reply to make said the count in a low tone	65.49581909179688
Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth said the president	47.247764587402344
Is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead Not guilty Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges	41.445072174072266
Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named God	32.68219757080078
Then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	30.12326431274414
Gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this HouseYes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	27.203125
Hayde had remained until the close of the meeting	39.50546646118164
She heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddesses	336.6789855957031
Chapter 87	124.58050537109375
The Challenge	67.2524642944336
Then continued Beauchamp I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen	182.9349822998047
The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugirard	75.32931518554688
I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight	374.55828857421875
Excuse me Albertsorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance	209.74537658691406
Yes Albert from whatever source the blow may have proceededit may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of Providence	210.951416015625
Albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing Beauchamps arm	237.5681915283203
My friend said he my life is ended	56.574676513671875
I can not calmly say with you Providence has struck the blow but I must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when I have found him I shall kill him or he will kill me	121.91716766357422
I rely on your friendship to assist me Beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart	123.10672760009766
Contempt my friend How does this misfortune affect you No happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions	123.07698059082031
Review your life Albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summers day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career No Albert take my advice	57.874210357666016
You are young and richleave Parisall is soon forgotten in this great Babylon of excitement and changing tastes	57.794124603271484
You will return after three or four years with a Russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago	42.873260498046875
Thank you my dear Beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it can not be	66.47437286376953
I have told you my wish or rather my determination	211.3385467529297
You understand that interested as I am in this affair I can not see it in the same light as you do	95.44966125488281
What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	249.53280639648438
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments I shall find one both palpable and visible on whom I shall revenge myself I assure you for all I have suffered during the last month	15.28451919555664
Now I repeat Beauchamp I wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow	66.65433502197266
Be it so said Beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth I submit and if you will seek your enemy I will assist you and I will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours	68.59898376464844
Well then you understand Beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	22.59947967529297
Each moments delay is an eternity for me	85.68444061279297
The calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself	48.4193115234375
Well listen Morcerf	20.583133697509766
Ah Beauchamp I see you know something already you will restore me to life	65.84713745117188
I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain	65.71173095703125
Tell me satisfy my impatience	100.12458038330078
Well I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yanina	47.05895233154297
Say on	38.428165435791016
I went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries	58.7256965637207
At the first word before I had even mentioned your fathers name	36.13526916503906
Ah said he	95.51080322265625
I guess what brings you here	60.86891555786133
How and why	269.0963134765625
Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject	88.64457702636719
By whom	215.42996215820312
By a banker of Paris my correspondent	215.87533569335938
Whose name is	82.40635681152344
He cried Albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred	44.81155014038086
He the man who would be popular can not forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same cause	111.63406372070312
Make inquiries Albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true	51.34685516357422
Oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all I have suffered	18.360000610351562
Beware Morcerf he is already an old man	153.5713653564453
I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally Oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face	20.105655670166016
I do not condemn you Albert I only restrain you	48.03482437133789
Act prudently	207.2525634765625
Oh do not fear besides you will accompany me	53.85879898071289
Beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness	60.47032928466797
Before this day closes if M	24.840173721313477
Danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or I shall die	12.435029029846191
Pardieu Beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral	30.238567352294922
When such resolutions are made Albert they should be promptly executed	2.9005866050720215
Do you wish to go to M	21.67019271850586
Danglars Let us go immediately	13.472140312194824
They sent for a cabriolet	112.6998519897461
On entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of M	1.3283413648605347
Andrea Cavalcanti	82.88169860839844
Ah parbleu that s good said Albert with a gloomy tone	43.062225341796875
If M	46.05617904663086
Danglars will not fight with me I will kill his soninlaw Cavalcanti will certainly fight	26.137042999267578
The servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted	27.284915924072266
It was however too late Albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the bankers study	49.64133071899414
Sir cried the latter am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house You appear to forget yourself sadly	122.52812194824219
No sir said Albert coldly there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardiceI offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at least	85.04776000976562
What is your errand then with me sir	58.69932556152344
I mean said Albert drawing near and without apparently noticing Cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplaceI mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficientwhere two men having met one of them will remain on the ground	33.749229431152344
Danglars turned pale Cavalcanti moved a step forward and Albert turned towards him	44.50322723388672
And you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them	93.83476257324219
Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men	140.7660369873047
Alberts attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed	293.33489990234375
Indeed sir said he to Albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you I shall resign the case to the kings attorney	175.03794860839844
You mistake sir said Morcerf with a gloomy smile I am not referring in the least to matrimony and I only addressed myself to M	1.2834471464157104
Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us	461.0806884765625
In one respect you are right for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim M	21.742345809936523
40212 m	234.700927734375
Sir replied Danglars pale with anger and fear I warn you when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog I kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime I believe I do society a kindness	39.43627166748047
Now if you are mad and try to bite me I will kill you without pity	45.67408752441406
Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself	73.25487518310547
Yes miserable wretch cried Morcerf it is your fault	75.57742309570312
Danglars retreated a few steps	354.6649169921875
My fault said he you must be mad What do I know of the Grecian affair Have I travelled in that country Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yaninato betray	365.54248046875
Silence said Albert with a thundering voice	117.71727752685547
No it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it	136.796142578125
Yes you How came it known	130.0255584716797
I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina	71.97257995605469
Who wrote to Yanina	1.116154670715332
To Yanina	1624.280029296875
Who wrote for particulars concerning my father	150.6595001220703
I imagine anyone may write to Yanina	115.5200424194336
But one person only wrote	47.3234977722168
One only	254.1407012939453
Yes and that was you	53.656551361083984
I doubtless wrote	325.80615234375
It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty	114.80030822753906
You wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive	84.21338653564453
I indeed I assure you cried Danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man I solemnly declare to you that I should never have thought of writing to Yanina did I know anything of Ali Pashas misfortunes	459.9881591796875
Who then urged you to write Tell me	50.1400032043457
Pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world	293.51763916015625
I was speaking of your fathers past history	1.0454856157302856
I said the origin of his fortune remained obscure	66.8619155883789
The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property I answered In Greece	142.90773010253906
Then said he write to Yanina	2.5785577297210693
And who thus advised you	1.0384876728057861
No other than your friend Monte Cristo	121.71502685546875
The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina	59.438934326171875
Yes and I wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like	426.25732421875
Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other	66.35418701171875
Sir said Beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from Paris at this moment and can not justify himself	19.4995059967041
I accuse no one sir said Danglars I relate and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you	47.34244918823242
Does the count know what answer you received	35.38801956176758
Yes I showed it to him	58.910804748535156
Did he know my fathers Christian name was Fernand and his family name Mondego	65.26814270019531
Yes I had told him that long since and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less	116.13481903076172
When the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughters hand for you I decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure	131.3179168701172
In short why should I have any more to do with the affair How did the honor or disgrace of M	120.06034088134766
de Morcerf affect me It neither increased nor decreased my income	80.89370727539062
Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject	35.9865837097168
Danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through fear	177.2079315185547
Besides what was Morcerf seeking It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident Danglars would not fight	27.2471981048584
In addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection	169.695068359375
Monte Cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha and knowing everything he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina	194.8772430419922
The answer known he had yielded to Alberts wish to be introduced to Hayde and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali and had not opposed Haydes recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few Romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate Morcerfs father	105.80575561523438
Besides had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his fathers name before Hayde Lastly he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near	47.83073043823242
There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged Monte Cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies	159.6964874267578
Albert took Beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	88.3335189819336
You are right said the latter M	20.776535034179688
Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of M	95.58720397949219
de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation	73.46585083007812
Albert turned	82.87284088134766
Sir said he to Danglars understand that I do not take a final leave of you I must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo	75.96481323242188
He bowed to the banker and went out with Beauchamp without appearing to notice Cavalcanti	24.105661392211914
Danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf	97.39965057373047
Chapter 88	19.162153244018555
The Insult	73.4526138305664
At the bankers door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf	515.3583984375
Listen said he just now I told you it was of M	134.2141876220703
de Monte Cristo you must demand an explanation	154.3460235595703
Yes and we are going to his house	89.81993865966797
Reflect Morcerf one moment before you go	176.6512908935547
On what shall I reflect	31.091468811035156
On the importance of the step you are taking	50.23868942260742
Is it more serious than going to M	61.899471282958984
Yes M	50.29140853881836
Danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel	227.35728454589844
The other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully	73.37877655029297
I only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight	1.232655644416809
Do not be alarmed said Beauchamp he will meet you	113.76009368896484
My only fear is that he will be too strong for you	29.262094497680664
My friend said Morcerf with a sweet smile that is what I wish	73.685546875
The happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all	78.13968658447266
Your mother would die of grief	44.991615295410156
My poor mother said Albert passing his hand across his eyes I know she would but better so than die of shame	96.4560546875
Are you quite decided Albert	290.5134582519531
Yes let us go	232.9571075439453
But do you think we shall find the count at home	16.407957077026367
He intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home	383.4958801269531
They ordered the driver to take them to No	412.2169189453125
30 Champslyses	35.00666427612305
Beauchamp wished to go in alone but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels	124.65971374511719
The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf	278.94610595703125
Albert sprang from the porters lodge to the steps	19.846900939941406
He was received by Baptistin	93.4572525024414
The count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted	29.870824813842773
But after his bath asked Morcerf	35.288795471191406
My master will go to dinner	81.34568786621094
And after dinner	83.1296615600586
He will sleep an hour	1134.2713623046875
He is going to the Opera	129.1709747314453
Are you sure of it asked Albert	70.69414520263672
Quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely	215.88973999023438
Very good replied Albert that is all I wished to know	796.908935546875
Then turning towards Beauchamp If you have anything to attend to Beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow	31.985523223876953
I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera and if you can bring ChteauRenaud with you	41.82460021972656
Beauchamp availed himself of Alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight	1.2148127555847168
On his return home Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray and Morrel to see them at the Opera that evening	45.93491744995117
Then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room	173.68788146972656
He found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	398.0913391113281
The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercds she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her	145.80203247070312
Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers bed	71.04346466064453
It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker	48.46872329711914
My dear mother said he do you know if M	86.44941711425781
de Morcerf has any enemy	79.2445068359375
Mercds started she noticed that the young man did not say my father	131.979248046875
My son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret enemies	149.7906494140625
Those who are known are not the most dangerous	77.83768463134766
I know it and appeal to your penetration	96.66822814941406
You are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you	66.1297607421875
Why do you say so	381.7691650390625
Because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that M	91.27056121826172
de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house	319.7702941894531
Mercds raised herself on her feverish arm	100.23234558105469
de Monte Cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me	94.02754211425781
40219 m	8.279182434082031
You know mother M	64.70005798339844
de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies	103.25201416015625
Do you say M	154.0247344970703
de Monte Cristo is our enemy replied Mercds becoming paler than the sheet which covered her	76.85326385498047
Who told you so Why you are mad Albert M	208.12603759765625
de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness	6832.779296875
de Monte Cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to us	70.11727905273438
Oh I entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his friendship	84.251708984375
Mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man	24.933452606201172
I said Mercds blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever	1.898276686668396
Yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm	84.31050109863281
Mercds shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze You speak strangely said she to Albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	163.33717346191406
What has the count done Three days since you were with him in Normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best friend	31.837615966796875
An ironical smile passed over Alberts lips	54.10031509399414
Mercds saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears	49.566246032714844
Albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed	78.89466094970703
You came to inquire after my health I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well	61.05397033691406
You should install yourself here and cheer my solitude	116.85639953613281
I do not wish to be left alone	60.990509033203125
Mother said the young man you know how gladly I would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening	104.37027740478516
Well replied Mercds sighing go Albert I will not make you a slave to your filial piety	39.42547607421875
Albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her	44.258636474609375
Scarcely had he shut her door when Mercds called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed	37.48286819458008
Then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen	88.01054382324219
The footmans mission was an easy one	156.48011779785156
Albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care	79.33865356445312
At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived he had seen ChteauRenaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised	40.209651947021484
Both got into Alberts coup and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud To the Opera	116.11981201171875
In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance	80.05705261230469
40221 m	77.7331314086914
ChteauRenaud was at his post apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from Albert	86.96892547607422
The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChteauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion	37.88807678222656
Debray was not yet come but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera	55.03961944580078
Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up	70.27262115478516
He hoped to meet with M	86.12199401855469
de Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs	78.28189086914062
The bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp	62.44343566894531
But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act	56.42222595214844
At last as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and Monte Cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit	53.015628814697266
Morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them	4.7294206619262695
The count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	186.2906036376953
He recognized Albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed	63.986724853515625
Without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another way	344.90118408203125
Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends	44.50725173950195
Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	95.61173248291016
He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	31.611770629882812
The door opened and Monte Cristo turning round saw Albert pale and trembling followed by Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	35.27649688720703
Well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object	14.303328514099121
Goodevening M	1.940279245376587
de Morcerf	3364.063720703125
The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	4197.7509765625
Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the Opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding	21.603668212890625
We are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said Albert but to demand an explanation	57.571414947509766
The young mans trembling voice was scarcely audible	51.383995056152344
An explanation at the Opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good	74.84463500976562
Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians I should not have thought this the place for such a demand	31.599716186523438
Still if people will shut themselves up said Albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen	179.6345672607422
I am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house	46.083396911621094
Yesterday I was at your house sir said the young man because then I knew not who you were	43.54841613769531
In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby	61.967369079589844
Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation	51.16984558105469
Where are you come from sir   said Monte Cristo You do not appear to be in the possession of your senses	53.06193923950195
Provided I understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged I shall be reasonable enough said Albert furiously	142.20364379882812
I do not understand you sir replied Monte Cristo and if I did your tone is too high	141.1844940185547
I am at home here and I alone have a right to raise my voice above anothers	9392.2060546875
Leave the box sir	153.0745086669922
Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity	324.4203796386719
Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of	180.45858764648438
Well well said Monte Cristo quietly I see you wish to quarrel with me but I would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	166.2000274658203
It is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge	18.66832733154297
Display is not becoming to everyone M	56.94200134277344
de Morcerf	107.90055847167969
At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene	153.55987548828125
They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole day	52.02436447143555
Albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when Morrel seized his hand while Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back	50.039859771728516
But Monte Cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man	148.8306427001953
Sir said he in a solemn tone I consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	149.6472930908203
Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the door	3.2585256099700928
Wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed Albert stepped back and Morrel closed the door	59.683921813964844
Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze	196.9281463623047
Morrel whispered What have you done to him	34.78392028808594
I Nothingat least personally said Monte Cristo	68.45764923095703
But there must be some cause for this strange scene	146.98243713378906
The Count of Morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man	54.841278076171875
Have you anything to do with it	70.73042297363281
It was through Hayde that the Chamber was informed of his fathers treason	106.92826843261719
Indeed said Morrel	78.03974151611328
I had been told but would not credit it that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali Pasha	26.994020462036133
It is true nevertheless	48.37841796875
Then said Morrel I understand it all and this scene was premeditated	25.62442398071289
How so	29.03145408630371
Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you	65.7469253540039
Probably said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity	19.814958572387695
But what shall you do with him	47.236083984375
With whom	54.02347946166992
With Albert	8.78897762298584
What shall I do with Albert As certainly Maximilian as I now press your hand I shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow morning	108.10980987548828
Morrel in his turn took Monte Cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was	70.12487030029297
Ah count said he his father loves him so much	73.09346771240234
Do not speak to me of that said Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed I will make him suffer	67.31939697265625
Morrel amazed let fall Monte Cristos hand	135.49234008789062
Count count said he	125.09284973144531
Dear Maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably Duprez is singing that line	59.7972412109375
O Mathilde idole de mon me	71.34386444091797
I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples and the first to applaud him	1.0830788612365723
Bravo bravo	97.97795867919922
Morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained	9.061502456665039
The curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door	119.8804702758789
Come in said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately Beauchamp appeared	27.172794342041016
Goodevening M	123.10150909423828
Beauchamp said Monte Cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated	73.85614776611328
Beauchamp bowed and sitting down Sir said he I just now accompanied M	34.243316650390625
de Morcerf as you saw	87.42354583740234
And that means replied Monte Cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together	55.80571746826172
I am happy to see M	54.42169952392578
Beauchamp that you are more sober than he was	57.73355484008789
Sir said M	32.15461730957031
Beauchamp Albert was wrong I acknowledge to betray so much anger and I come on my own account to apologize for him	95.19031524658203
And having done so entirely on my own account be it understood I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yanina	1037.39892578125
Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl	131.2723388671875
Monte Cristo motioned him to be silent	64.93299865722656
Come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed	18.111270904541016
How so asked Beauchamp	12.316739082336426
Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	110.12271881103516
I am in your opinion a Lara a Manfred a Lord Ruthven then just as I am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me	135.4053955078125
You bring me down to your own level and demand explanations Indeed M	158.84710693359375
Beauchamp it is quite laughable	67.84871673583984
Yet replied Beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands	74.7496566772461
Beauchamp interposed this strange man the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself	131.35955810546875
Say no more I entreat you	29.289831161499023
I do what I please M	290.3152770996094
Beauchamp and it is always well done	34.24061965942383
Sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin	129.39492797851562
I require honorable guaranties	33.561771392822266
I am sir a living guaranty replied Monte Cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guaranty	4100.095703125
Tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock I shall see what color his is	68.57122039794922
Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel said Beauchamp	112.79812622070312
It is quite immaterial to me said Monte Cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle	172.68930053710938
In France people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in Arabia with the dagger	82.53723907470703
Tell your client that although I am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity I leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as I am sure to gain	275.2677917480469
Sure to gain repeated Beauchamp looking with amazement at the count	93.11354064941406
Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise I would not fight with M	28.130664825439453
de Morcerf	91.5575942993164
I shall kill himI can not help it	44.280513763427734
Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour I do not like to be kept waiting	35.49739074707031
Pistols then at eight oclock in the Bois de Vincennes said Beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being	256.53143310546875
Very well sir said Monte Cristo	150.8730010986328
Now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his illchosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep	138.94110107421875
Beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed	199.36492919921875
Now said Monte Cristo turning towards Morrel I may depend upon you may I not	123.08941650390625
Certainly said Morrel I am at your service count still	98.84684753417969
It is desirable I should know the real cause	95.36963653564453
That is to say you would rather not	48.36648178100586
The young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to God and to me but I give you my word Morrel that God who does know it will be on our side	138.97787475585938
Enough said Morrel who is your second witness	1560.39990234375
I know no one in Paris Morrel on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother Emmanuel	149.3402862548828
Do you think Emmanuel would oblige me	119.44510650634766
I will answer for him count	62.74809265136719
Well that is all I require	343.37982177734375
Tomorrow morning at seven oclock you will be with me will you not	35.939422607421875
We will	164.3909912109375
Hush the curtain is rising	137.956787109375
Listen I never lose a note of this opera if I can avoid it the music of William Tell is so sweet	114.50753784179688
Chapter 89	43.224266052246094
The Night	347.69659423828125
Monte Cristo waited according to his usual custom until Duprez had sung his famous Suivezmoi then he rose and went out	104.26183319091797
Morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring Emmanuel	27.051631927490234
Then he stepped into his coup calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	34.04029083251953
No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said	27.91279411315918
Ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross	104.9486312866211
Ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot	56.44900131225586
These were pistols of an especial pattern which Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own room	138.8993682861328
A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	137.88436889648438
He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and Baptistin entered	54.75413513183594
Before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after Baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in	266.6001892089844
Baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him	276.74169921875
Who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman	58.42332458496094
40227 m	90.77220916748047
The stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair	431.5581970214844
Edmond you will not kill my son	59.875789642333984
The count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held	52.411949157714844
What name did you pronounce then Madame de Morcerf said he	2086.612548828125
Yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which I alone perhaps have not forgotten	177.72633361816406
Edmond it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you it is Mercds	20.64996337890625
Mercds is dead madame said Monte Cristo I know no one now of that name	69.80177307128906
Mercds lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice Edmondby the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M	8.157655715942383
de Morcerf	145.31228637695312
Fernand do you mean replied Monte Cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all	161.0653839111328
Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercds felt a thrill of horror run through every vein	92.88099670410156
You see Edmond I am not mistaken and have cause to say Spare my son	74.86719512939453
And who told you madame that I have any hostile intentions against your son	27.75775909423828
No one in truth but a mother has twofold sight	225.07308959960938
I guessed all I followed him this evening to the Opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all	45.56515884399414
If you have seen all madame you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me said Monte Cristo with awful calmness	167.8199005126953
Oh for pitys sake	226.13768005371094
You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel one of my friends had not stopped him	148.92881774902344
Listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to you	104.66007995605469
Madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a punishment	60.03245544433594
It is not I who strike M	25.79332160949707
de Morcerf it is Providence which punishes him	48.55724334716797
And why do you represent Providence cried Mercds	213.4416046142578
Why do you remember when it forgets What are Yanina and its vizier to you Edmond What injury has Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali Tepelini	59.61958312988281
Ah madame replied Monte Cristo all this is an affair between the French captain and the daughter of Vasiliki	34.42399978637695
It does not concern me you are right and if I have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the French captain or the Count of Morcerf but on the fisherman Fernand the husband of Mercds the Catalane	77.28728485107422
Ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor I am the only culprit Edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude	89.4543228149414
But exclaimed Monte Cristo why was I absent And why were you alone	73.83308410644531
40231 m	132.75140380859375
Because you had been arrested Edmond and were a prisoner	71.36840057373047
And why was I arrested Why was I a prisoner	62.625240325927734
I do not know said Mercds	99.73247528076172
You do not madame at least I hope not	450.93121337890625
But I will tell you	118.3708267211914
I was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of La Rserve the day before I was to marry you a man named Danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman Fernand himself posted	120.15947723388672
Monte Cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty huethis he placed in the hands of Mercds	87.73542022705078
It was Danglars letter to the kings attorney which the Count of Monte Cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson   French had taken from the file against Edmond Dants on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M	55.09865188598633
de Boville	104.08435821533203
Mercds read with terror the following lines	33.042964935302734
The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants second in command on board the Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris	103.32770538330078
Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dants who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	41.21989059448242
Should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dants on board the Pharaon	77.55311584472656
How dreadful said Mercds passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter	44.46459197998047
I bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said Monte Cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you	98.70252990722656
And the result of that letter	28.82504653930664
You well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	110.45281982421875
You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the Chteau dIf	50.969940185546875
You do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of vengeance which I had made the first day and yet I was not aware that you had married Fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger	81.06588745117188
Can it be cried Mercds shuddering	91.68875122070312
That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it and that is why on account of the living Mercds and my deceased father I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand andI have revenged myself	420.22149658203125
And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that	172.2473602294922
I am satisfied madame that he did what I have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass over to the English that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against the Spaniards that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali	226.0118865966797
Compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her	147.75160217285156
Well the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor Ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but I betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of God to punish that man	146.4468231201172
He sends me for that purpose and here I am	7.067459583282471
The poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	66.88787841796875
Forgive Edmond forgive for my sake who love you still	19.66864776611328
The dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother	61.13764190673828
Her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	128.3814239501953
Then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	65.2281265258789
Not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment Impossible madame impossible	80.9188232421875
Edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when I call you Edmond why do you not call me Mercds	27.892436981201172
Mercds repeated Monte Cristo Mercds Well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly	7.7150397300720215
Oh Mercds I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair I have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon I have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	71.64527130126953
Mercds I must revenge myself for I suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years I wept I cursed now I tell you Mercds I must revenge myself	48.44466781616211
The count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred	110.79447937011719
Revenge yourself then Edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culpritson him on me but not on my son	194.12295532226562
It is written in the good book said Monte Cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation	96.07496643066406
Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet why should I seek to make myself better than God	56.34885025024414
Edmond continued Mercds with her arms extended towards the count since I first knew you I have adored your name have respected your memory	55.68158721923828
Edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	44.58942413330078
Edmond if you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead Yes dead alas I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and I wept What could I do for you Edmond besides pray and weep Listen for ten years I dreamed each night the same dream	59.62120056152344
I had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Chteau dIf and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers	11.563347816467285
Well Edmond I swear to you by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pityEdmond for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold	61.83580780029297
And I too Edmondoh believe meguilty as I wasoh yes I too have suffered much	118.57911682128906
Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried Monte Cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon	54.847190856933594
No interrupted Mercds but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son	85.77003479003906
Mercds uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob	54.486446380615234
The lion was daunted the avenger was conquered	74.41822814941406
What do you ask of me said heyour sons life Well he shall live	95.19512176513672
Mercds uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless God had sent some angel to collect themfar more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir	10.425599098205566
Oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you Edmond Now you are exactly what I dreamt you werethe man I always loved	921.2686767578125
Oh now I may say so	380.4599609375
So much the better replied Monte Cristo as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by you	39.7515983581543
Death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness	3.788978099822998
What do you say Edmond	40.070655822753906
I say since you command me Mercds I must die	98.61366271972656
Die and why so Who talks of dying Whence have you these ideas of death	28.577199935913086
You do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your sonchallenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryyou do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live	310.46478271484375
What I most loved after you Mercds was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men that strength was my life	79.15677642822266
With one word you have crushed it and I die	132.7584228515625
But the duel will not take place Edmond since you forgive	8.405440330505371
It will take place said Monte Cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sons blood to stain the ground mine will flow	48.722900390625
Mercds shrieked and sprang towards Monte Cristo but suddenly stopping Edmond said she there is a God above us since you live and since I have seen you again I trust to him from my heart	110.60449981689453
While waiting his assistance I trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not	27.19715118408203
Yes madame he shall live said Monte Cristo surprised that without more emotion Mercds had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her	53.52560806274414
Mercds extended her hand to the count	92.43982696533203
Edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her Alas I am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my Edmond by a smile or by a look of that Mercds whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating	32.96224594116211
Ah believe me Edmond as I told you I too have suffered much I repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over	85.99564361572266
No it is not finished I feel it by what remains in my heart	1.145190954208374
Oh I repeat it Edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is sublime	28.115497589111328
Do you say so now Mercdsthen what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you Suppose that the Supreme Being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was goodsuppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then Mercds you could not imagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment	1.0454856157302856
Mercds looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude	268.41583251953125
Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts	51.40178680419922
Edmond said Mercds I have but one word more to say to you	91.65116119384766
The count smiled bitterly	147.1934814453125
Edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if Mercds in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	148.80538940429688
Adieu then Edmond I have nothing more to ask of heavenI have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were	723.9407958984375
Adieu Edmond adieu and thank you	88.39073944091797
But the count did not answer	155.4374237060547
Mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	21.742345809936523
The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the Champslyses and made Monte Cristo raise his head	214.07447814941406
What a fool I was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself	87.42642211914062
Chapter 90	85.04666137695312
The Meeting	113.51506042480469
After Mercds had left Monte Cristo he fell into profound gloom	68.48700714111328
Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	425.51446533203125
What said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what this edifice which I have been so long preparing which I have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath Yes this self of whom I thought so much of whom I was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the Chteau dIf and whom I had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow	123.49842071533203
Alas it is not the death of the body I regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed and which I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon What is death for me One step farther into resttwo perhaps into silence	403.47076416015625
No it is not existence then that I regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed	609.2002563476562
Providence is now opposed to them when I most thought it would be propitious	128.84075927734375
It is not Gods will that they should be accomplished	48.04117202758789
This burden almost as heavy as a world which I had raised and I had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	69.0956802368164
Oh shall I then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in Providence	67.55374908447266
And all thisall this because my heart which I thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	65.40191650390625
Yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which Mercds had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	164.70028686523438
There are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration	82.9162368774414
No she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous	125.37794494628906
The blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his mind	106.69302368164062
Ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	113.34603118896484
I ridiculous No I would rather die	793.55224609375
By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercds to spare her son the count at last exclaimed	175.80239868164062
Folly folly follyto carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	150.20599365234375
He will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memoryand this surely is not vanity but a justifiable prideit is important the world should know that I have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself	44.1156120300293
It must be it shall be	146.857177734375
Seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death	162.63011169433594
I do this Oh my God said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine	15.446005821228027
I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like Morcerf Danglars Villefort even Morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	61.7538948059082
Let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by Providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity	44.8481330871582
While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of Providence	1.0959552526474
It was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	194.39695739746094
He turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	288.8407287597656
He arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw Hayde who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back	13.97276782989502
She had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching	52.2923469543457
The noise of the door did not awaken her and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret	183.94615173339844
She remembered that she had a son said he and I forgot I had a daughter	25.308870315551758
Then shaking his head sorrowfully Poor Hayde said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something	134.93309020996094
Oh I can not go without taking leave of her I can not die without confiding her to someone	209.6431884765625
He quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines	146.30772399902344
I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahisand son of my former patron Pierre Morrel shipowner at Marseillesthe sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister Julie and brotherinlaw Emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness	158.18731689453125
These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo of which Bertuccio knows the secret	217.8433380126953
If his heart is free and he will marry Hayde the daughter of Ali Pasha of Yanina whom I have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish	107.70733642578125
This will has already constituted Hayde heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in England Austria and Holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions	403.386474609375
40241 m	138.65631103515625
He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand	122.27394104003906
Hayde said he did you read it	87.33363342285156
Oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour Why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me Are you going to leave me	143.10548400878906
I am going on a journey dear child said Monte Cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me	144.37147521972656
The count stopped	57.76191711425781
Well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him	43.1859245300293
Well if any misfortune happen to me replied Monte Cristo I wish my daughter to be happy	87.00601196289062
Hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	661.0514526367188
Do you think of dying my lord said she	250.82737731933594
The wise man my child has said It is good to think of death	408.97021484375
Well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die I shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room	55.51890563964844
Then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	59.87376022338867
The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father	86.45646667480469
Alas murmured he with intense suffering I might then have been happy yet	187.1316680908203
Then he carried Hayde to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will	162.2490234375
As he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard	143.3031768798828
Monte Cristo approached the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight	94.7223129272461
Good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three seals	91.03675842285156
A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	82.05229187011719
Morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed	206.75161743164062
I am perhaps come too soon count said he but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house	439.22509765625
I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself	75.19709777832031
Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms	245.0436248779297
Morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you	21.389427185058594
Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come with me then Maximilian	32.097721099853516
Did you doubt it said the young captain	161.53286743164062
But if I were wrong	571.3486328125
I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday I have been thinking of your firmness all night and I said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied on	246.47694396972656
But Morrel Albert is your friend	67.22069549560547
Simply an acquaintance sir	209.13108825683594
You met on the same day you first saw me	232.5527801513672
Yes that is true but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me	127.28514862060547
Thank you Morrel	84.78165435791016
Then ringing the bell once Look	4.083975315093994
said he to Ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor	301.9866943359375
It is my will Morrel	194.4938507080078
When I am dead you will go and examine it	55.60347366333008
What said Morrel you dead	263.6744384765625
Yes must I not be prepared for everything dear friend But what did you do yesterday after you left me	141.81590270996094
I went to Tortonis where as I expected I found Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	279.3442687988281
I own I was seeking them	384.8164367675781
Why when all was arranged	80.3246841430664
Listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable	122.55125427246094
Did you doubt it	110.6241226196289
No the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it	56.962615966796875
Well I hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind	49.43291091918945
Have you succeeded asked Monte Cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope	75.15097045898438
No for your skill with the sword is so well known	154.11619567871094
Ahwho has betrayed me	49.13993835449219
The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered	103.16036987304688
And you failed	347.9322814941406
They positively refused	74.01751708984375
Morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol	123.96310424804688
Well we have time look	67.33827209472656
Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercds entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club	113.31258392333984
At each shot Morrel turned pale	130.21878051757812
He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot	197.23382568359375
It is astonishing said he	134.97845458984375
Look Emmanuel	48.96446990966797
Then turning towards Monte Cristo Count said he in the name of all that is dear to you I entreat you not to kill Albertthe unhappy youth has a mother	11.209532737731934
You are right said Monte Cristo and I have none	70.9537124633789
These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder	148.0290985107422
You are the offended party count	5.095914840698242
Doubtless what does that imply	77.38954162597656
That you will fire first	276.8226013183594
I fire first	49.115966796875
Oh I obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that	88.98944091796875
And at what distance	129.14671325683594
Twenty paces	115.1920394897461
A smile of terrible import passed over the counts lips	64.74517822265625
Morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen	141.39166259765625
The only chance for Alberts safety then will arise from your emotion	246.081298828125
I suffer from emotion said Monte Cristo	1.679030418395996
Or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are I may say what would appear absurd to another	189.83245849609375
What is that	174.5726776123047
Break his armwound himbut do not kill him	102.82951354980469
I will tell you Morrel said the count that I do not need entreating to spare the life of M	44.119293212890625
de Morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I	54.13664627075195
And you	143.5008544921875
That will be another thing I shall be brought home	61.3836555480957
No no cried Maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	73.7416763305664
As I told you my dear Morrel M	5.9566264152526855
de Morcerf will kill me	84.50325012207031
Morrel looked at him in utter amazement	70.569091796875
But what has happened then since last evening count	84.41481018066406
The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi I have seen a ghost	170.5692901611328
And that ghost	216.15054321289062
Told me Morrel that I had lived long enough	79.68252563476562
Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other	52.972660064697266
Monte Cristo drew out his watch	42.69834518432617
Let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight oclock	52.674156188964844
A carriage was in readiness at the door	1.2796484231948853
Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two friends	2292.563232421875
He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and Maximilian and Emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within	1.0950689315795898
As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	1.1646064519882202
We are first said Morrel looking out of the window	1.1488604545593262
Excuse me sir said Baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees	5015.806640625
Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximilian	1619.8912353515625
The latter retained the counts hand between his	91.02642822265625
I like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause	138.2848358154297
It seems to me said Emmanuel that I see two young men down there who are evidently waiting	64.40975952148438
Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	95.2303466796875
Maximilian said he are your affections disengaged Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment	19.439552307128906
I do not seek your confidence my dear friend	118.96741485595703
I only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all I require	50.717159271240234
I love a young girl count	366.141845703125
Do you love her much	55.89357376098633
More than my life	36.17121887207031
Another hope defeated said the count	77.2793960571289
Then with a sigh Poor Hayde murmured he	93.58287048339844
To tell the truth count if I knew less of you I should think that you were less brave than you are	55.051273345947266
Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving Come Morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage	30.332008361816406
Do I regret life What is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death Moreover do not alarm yourself Morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone	121.38818359375
I know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid	31.801944732666016
That is to the purpose	119.23432922363281
Have you brought your arms	31.048913955688477
Iwhat for I hope these gentlemen have theirs	69.21409606933594
I will inquire said Morrel	10.037507057189941
Do but make no treatyyou understand me	88.41127014160156
You need not fear	317.0010070800781
Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud who seeing his intention came to meet him	26.631792068481445
The three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	652.43896484375
Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel but I do not see M	30.420639038085938
de Morcerf	95.79824829101562
He sent us word this morning replied ChteauRenaud that he would meet us on the ground	25.791439056396484
Ah said Morrel	92.30962371826172
Beauchamp pulled out his watch	25.501192092895508
It is only five minutes past eight said he to Morrel there is not much time lost yet	58.0582160949707
Oh I made no allusion of that kind replied Morrel	217.12840270996094
There is a carriage coming said ChteauRenaud	87.21868133544922
It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	72.15628051757812
You are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen M	157.10829162597656
de Monte Cristo yields his right of using his	169.95834350585938
We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said Beauchamp and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	37.02909469604492
They are quite new and have not yet been used	34.10591125488281
Will you examine them	88.72856903076172
Oh M	473.671875
Beauchamp if you assure me that M	12.751055717468262
de Morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient	201.35862731933594
Gentlemen said ChteauRenaud it is not Morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is Franz and Debray	33.18071365356445
The two young men he announced were indeed approaching	62.20539093017578
What chance brings you here gentlemen said ChteauRenaud shaking hands with each of them	28.33361053466797
Because said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to come	30.121231079101562
Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud exchanged looks of astonishment	144.2862091064453
I think I understand his reason said Morrel	44.89017868041992
What is it	265.6312255859375
Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M	99.117431640625
de Morcerf begging me to attend the Opera	93.1343765258789
And I said Debray	1721.8551025390625
And I also said Franz	270.7848205566406
And we too added Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	135.09170532226562
Having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat	33.69974899291992
Exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right	75.77626037597656
But after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ChteauRenaud	73.94713592529297
Albert is ten minutes after time	279.5982360839844
There he comes said Beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant	12.327125549316406
How imprudent said ChteauRenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions I had given him	234.45785522460938
And besides said Beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat Why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more simple	153.18841552734375
Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men	21.94158935546875
He jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined them	113.89817810058594
He was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept	48.64239501953125
A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him	78.40438079833984
I thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship	94.7325668334961
Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached and remained at a short distance	106.30184936523438
And to you also M	37.714725494384766
Morrel my thanks are due	44.02804183959961
Come there can not be too many	342.6521301269531
40248 m	61.79209518432617
Sir said Maximilian you are not perhaps aware that I am M	7.034152507781982
de Monte Cristos friend	211.41111755371094
I was not sure but I thought it might be so	83.78317260742188
So much the better the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied	439.1278991699219
Morrel said ChteauRenaud will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that M	1382.2550048828125
de Morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal	104.17591857910156
Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	70.20355987548828
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	84.47855377197266
Stop gentlemen said Albert I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo	44.55446243286133
In private asked Morrel	73.50628662109375
No sir before all who are here	33.02825164794922
Alberts witnesses looked at each other	82.36880493164062
Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper and Morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with Emmanuel	30.368732452392578
What does he want with me said Monte Cristo	121.148681640625
I do not know but he wishes to speak to you	107.67400360107422
Ah said Monte Cristo I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult	129.52951049804688
I do not think that such is his intention said Morrel	77.92157745361328
The count advanced accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel	91.85022735595703
His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Alberts griefstricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men	62.05794143676758
When at three paces distant from each other Albert and the count stopped	62.93153381347656
Approach gentlemen said Albert I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte Cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you	139.0569610595703
Proceed sir said the count	61.3836555480957
Sir said Albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M	1.1020768880844116
de Morcerf in Epirus for guilty as I knew he was I thought you had no right to punish him but I have since learned that you had that right	31.102739334106445
It is not Fernand Mondegos treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you and the almost unheardof miseries which were its consequences and I say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and I his son thank you for not using greater severity	101.8917465209961
Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did Alberts declaration	933.8286743164062
As for Monte Cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	47.38418197631836
He could not understand how Alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation	54.95897674560547
He recognized the influence of Mercds and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless	129.17257690429688
Now sir said Albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	52.04658126831055
Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault	294.3090515136719
But this confession concerns me only	4.629002094268799
I acted well as a man but you have acted better than man	378.25506591796875
An angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other	105.23868560791016
Monte Cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear	7.858409404754639
Gentlemen said he M	106.05194091796875
de Monte Cristo receives my apology	79.0931625366211
I had acted hastily towards him	2008.0384521484375
Hasty actions are generally bad ones	60.18611526489258
Now my fault is repaired	192.41896057128906
I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	56.616615295410156
But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies I shall endeavor to correct his mistake	125.8698501586914
What happened during the night asked Beauchamp of ChteauRenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here	103.69156646728516
In truth what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	61.83306884765625
What can it mean said Debray to Franz	899.3411254882812
The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to M	22.276212692260742
de Morcerf and is justified by his son Had I ten Yaninas in my family I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times	80.2372055053711
As for Monte Cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless	150.08851623535156
Bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of Albert of Beauchamp of ChteauRenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	39.98967361450195
Providence still murmured he now only am I fully convinced of being the emissary of God	135.15574645996094
Chapter 91	126.53348541259766
Mother and Son	114.53730010986328
The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with Maximilian and Emmanuel	1.1020768880844116
Albert Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud remained alone	124.16642761230469
Albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	112.66288757324219
Indeed my dear friend said Beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable affair	278.1501159667969
Albert remained silent and wrapped in thought	19.574453353881836
ChteauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	66.55391693115234
Are we not going said he after this embarrassing silence	320.1714172363281
When you please replied Beauchamp allow me only to compliment M	103.13195037841797
de Morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity	68.2259521484375
Oh yes said ChteauRenaud	76.40113830566406
It is magnificent continued Beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol	206.89146423339844
Assuredly as for me I should have been incapable of it said ChteauRenaud with most significant coolness	30.64803695678711
Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between M	414.208740234375
de Monte Cristo and myself	29.171051025390625
Possibly possibly said Beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	61.67332077026367
May I give you a friendly counsel Set out for Naples the Hague or St	167.5617218017578
Petersburgcalm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hotheaded Parisians	161.4506378173828
Seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years	64.32921600341797
Am I not right M	71.96289825439453
de ChteauRenaud	54.35691833496094
40252 m	73.19091033935547
That is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn	45.9433708190918
Thank you gentlemen replied Albert with a smile of indifference I shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because I had before intended to quit France	490.2789306640625
I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds	73.0572280883789
It is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said I remember that only	137.1223602294922
ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which Morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	129.41647338867188
Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man	69.73845672607422
The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand	44.216312408447266
Goodbye said ChteauRenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right	227.14100646972656
Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	247.5008544921875
He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of Paris	137.19390869140625
In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder	49.60947036743164
As he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts bedroom	54.14738464355469
Albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments	97.83155059814453
He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	569.4107666015625
Then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	112.17037200927734
Then he arranged all his beautiful Turkish arms his fine English guns his Japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by Feuchres or Barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocketmoney he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewelboxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there	71.61015319824219
At the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room	92.24885559082031
What do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone	405.29736328125
Pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the Count of Morcerf has called me	62.64976119995117
Well said Albert	175.31761169433594
I did not like to go to him without first seeing you	78.69950103759766
Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this morning	105.26031494140625
40254 m	79.49785614013672
It is probable said Albert	48.55382537841797
And since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there	73.24765014648438
What must I answer	604.665283203125
The truth	27.47088050842285
Then I shall say the duel did not take place	233.39205932617188
You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo	52.97780990600586
The valet bowed and retired and Albert returned to his inventory	167.33343505859375
As he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention	27.389957427978516
He approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away	215.662353515625
The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door	142.637451171875
As if the same idea had animated these two beings Mercds was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	35.989925384521484
Everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys	141.4541015625
Albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming My mother he threw his arms around her neck	241.8253936767578
The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture	15.513190269470215
All these proofs of an energetic resolution which Albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother	132.79319763183594
What are you doing asked he	92.71051788330078
What were you doing replied she	1.0454856157302856
Oh my mother exclaimed Albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou can not have made the same resolution I have for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house andand to you	64.70977783203125
I also replied Mercds am going and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me have I deceived myself	120.79237365722656
Mother said Albert with firmness	43.316349029541016
I can not make you share the fate I have planned for myself	87.29840850830078
I must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one	1.1020768880844116
So my dear mother I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants	38.43942642211914
You my poor child suffer poverty and hunger Oh do not say so it will break my resolutions	307.6712951660156
But not mine mother replied Albert	53.34560775756836
I am young and strong I believe I am courageous and since yesterday I have learned the power of will	102.8752212524414
Alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which God had given them I have seen that mother I know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	60.763736724853516
No mother from this moment I have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another	177.54006958007812
Albert my child said Mercds if I had a stronger heart that is the counsel I would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates	54.23400115966797
You had friends Albert break off their acquaintance	87.94454956054688
But do not despair you have life before you my dear Albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was Herrera	189.87075805664062
I am sure my dear Albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious	47.808067321777344
Then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if I am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for I have no future to look forward to	119.29637908935547
For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this house	871.7386474609375
I will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man	28.02665138244629
Yes I share your hopes the anger of Heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and I am innocent	105.57649230957031
But since our resolution is formed let us act promptly	51.00416946411133
de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation	93.7344970703125
I am ready my son said Mercds	201.77943420410156
Albert ran to fetch a carriage	153.54640197753906
He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des SaintsPres where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess	90.84517669677734
As the carriage stopped at the door and Albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter	36.04973220825195
Albert recognized the bearer	108.31198120117188
From the count said Bertuccio	1068.7027587890625
Albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for Bertuccio but he was gone	273.5942687988281
He returned to Mercds with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter	49.409366607666016
Mercds read	65.57669830322266
AlbertWhile showing you that I have discovered your plans I hope also to convince you of my delicacy	179.65240478515625
You are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect Albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her	70.00028991699219
Keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and Providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty	341.6619567871094
I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with you	485.31341552734375
Do not seek to know how I discovered it I know itthat is sufficient	380.1868591308594
Now listen Albert	100.52758026123047
Twentyfour years ago I returned proud and joyful to my country	73.91572570800781
I had a betrothed Albert a lovely girl whom I adored and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil	388.9643249511719
This money was for her I destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles on the Alles de Meilhan	47.74565505981445
Your mother Albert knows that poor house well	74.07365417480469
A short time since I passed through Marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure	108.7046890258789
The iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day I was born which overshadowed the spot	82.01016235351562
Well Albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose	47.352664947509766
Oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved	26.107458114624023
You are a generous man Albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair	32.373878479003906
Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter	428.185302734375
Mercds turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven	115.69247436523438
I accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which I shall take with me to some convent	11.444162368774414
Putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs	717.188232421875
Chapter 92	221.19297790527344
The Suicide	247.59588623046875
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and Maximilian	199.04388427734375
Their return was cheerful	196.169921875
Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight	43.19234085083008
Morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance	72.8936767578125
At the Barrire du Trne they met Bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post	114.77413940429688
Monte Cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared	45.07272720336914
Count said Emmanuel when they were at the end of the Place Royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours	6504.10986328125
If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said Morrel I would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort	1397.3988037109375
So we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home	146.216552734375
Stop a moment said Monte Cristo do not let me lose both my companions	629.2293090820312
Return Emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you Morrel accompany me to the Champslyses	14.166172981262207
Willingly said Maximilian particularly as I have business in that quarter	226.81814575195312
Shall we wait breakfast for you asked Emmanuel	345.9117736816406
No replied the young man	108.6292495727539
The door was closed and the carriage proceeded	79.9548110961914
See what good fortune I brought you said Morrel when he was alone with the count	26.333887100219727
Have you not thought so	1.3574161529541016
Yes said Monte Cristo for that reason I wished to keep you near me	59.874534606933594
It is miraculous continued Morrel answering his own thoughts	487.7751770019531
What said Monte Cristo	152.30906677246094
What has just happened	232.9080047607422
Yes said the Count you are rightit is miraculous	145.8705291748047
For Albert is brave resumed Morrel	161.12399291992188
Very brave said Monte Cristo I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head	27.730361938476562
And I know he has fought two duels said Morrel	117.89096069335938
How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning	85.2745590209961
All owing to your influence replied Monte Cristo smiling	134.35922241210938
It is well for Albert he is not in the army said Morrel	80.06250762939453
An apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	84.68768310546875
Come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men Morrel Acknowledge that if Albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise	10.305120468139648
Doubtless doubtless said Morrel but I shall say like the Spaniard He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday	99.6695327758789
You will breakfast with me will you not Morrel said the count to turn the conversation	267.731201171875
No I must leave you at ten oclock	73.0673599243164
Your engagement was for breakfast then said the count	134.85299682617188
Morrel smiled and shook his head	36.11878967285156
Still you must breakfast somewhere	229.44345092773438
But if I am not hungry said the young man	45.64807891845703
Oh said the count I only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as I am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand love	74.65269470214844
Now after what you told me this morning of your heart I may believe	40.75194549560547
Well count replied Morrel gayly I will not dispute it	44.32889175415039
But you will not make me your confidant Maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret	112.06874084472656
I showed you this morning that I had a heart did I not count Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	78.95758819580078
Well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes it is elsewhere and I must go and find it	13.298871994018555
Go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love and that I love you Morrel	344.73199462890625
40260 m	96.40846252441406
I will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	30.094480514526367
When I need your assistance and the moment arrives I will come to you count	121.04825592041016
Well I rely upon your promise	60.693485260009766
Goodbye then	2141.304443359375
Goodbye till we meet again	37.945594787597656
They had arrived in the Champslyses	153.8748321533203
Monte Cristo opened the carriagedoor Morrel sprang out on the pavement Bertuccio was waiting on the steps	50.26169204711914
Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio	21.69615936279297
Well asked he	21.53594970703125
She is going to leave her house said the steward	269.59271240234375
And her son	148.68011474609375
Florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same	1.2092407941818237
Come this way	260.89483642578125
Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward	174.3146514892578
Go said he quickly	50.00979995727539
But first let Hayde be informed that I have returned	38.62936019897461
Here I am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely	62.67805862426758
Bertuccio left	44.32295608520508
Every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by Hayde during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected	35.868553161621094
Doubtless although less evident Monte Cristos joy was not less intense	220.5010986328125
Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent	16.81656837463379
Monte Cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two Mercds in the world and he might yet be happy	61.88982391357422
His eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Hayde when suddenly the door opened	147.2044219970703
The count knit his brow	59.554317474365234
de Morcerf said Baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse	278.24774169921875
In fact the counts face brightened	184.2520751953125
Which asked he the viscount or the count	68.08909606933594
The count	101.23070526123047
Oh exclaimed Hayde is it not yet over	35.63663864135742
I know not if it is finished my beloved child said Monte Cristo taking the young girls hands but I do know you have nothing more to fear	123.36077117919922
But it is the wretched	99.85724639892578
That man can not injure me Hayde said Monte Cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to fear	107.5838851928711
And what I have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord	147.08775329589844
Monte Cristo smiled	191.15554809570312
By my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl I swear to you Hayde that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me	316.5445251464844
I believe you my lord as implicitly as if God had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him	122.5297622680664
Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly	108.2529067993164
Oh murmured the count shall I then be permitted to love again Ask M	35.70772171020508
de Morcerf into the drawingroom said he to Baptistin while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase	75.63402557373047
We must explain this visit which although expected by Monte Cristo is unexpected to our readers	101.46251678466797
While Mercds as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to Alberts while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard	141.70822143554688
He who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerfs apartments	20.241771697998047
From that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	97.67451477050781
He remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	158.5970458984375
For him those ten minutes were very long	85.98161315917969
It was then Albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	86.3052978515625
The counts eye expanded he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel	44.24522399902344
Albert returned safelythen the count was revenged	183.01742553710938
An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb	31.404857635498047
But as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph	6.617738246917725
He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fathers honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms	88.78518676757812
It was then when the count could not see Albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him	67.46435546875
Ten minutes afterwards General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves	79.2696762084961
He had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coachhouse ready for him	80.43303680419922
The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman	61.65785598754883
The coachman stooped down for his orders	68.0151138305664
To the Champslyses said the general the Count of Monte Cristos	73.32868957519531
The horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts door	45.65692901611328
de Morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	928.5191040039062
A moment afterwards Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo and the latter leading Hayde aside ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawingroom	496.0470275878906
The general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived Monte Cristo at the door	118.29347229003906
Ah it is M	164.482177734375
de Morcerf said Monte Cristo quietly I thought I had not heard aright	76.8082046508789
Yes it is I said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	177.4566192626953
May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M	385.92010498046875
de Morcerf so early	142.40863037109375
Had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	67.63126373291016
I had replied the count	47.834632873535156
And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you	38.526283264160156
Yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight	531.4466552734375
Yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house	39.3012580871582
It is true sir said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal	151.74530029296875
Doubtless you made then some apology or explanation	279.8037414550781
I explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me	21.168039321899414
But to what do you attribute this conduct	117.65431213378906
To the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than I	27.149768829345703
And who was that	31.628780364990234
His father	392.3952331542969
That may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted	167.2335662841797
I know it and I expected this result	130.46595764160156
You expected my son would be a coward cried the count	176.4272918701172
Albert de Morcerf is no coward said Monte Cristo	100.715087890625
A man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward Why is he not here that I may tell him so	277.2734680175781
Sir replied Monte Cristo coldly I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs	12.874643325805664
Go and tell M	252.06605529785156
Albert that and he may know what to answer you	29.256771087646484
Oh no no said the general smiling faintly I did not come for that purpose you are right	187.1234588623047
I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my enemy	25.8115177154541
I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively that it seems as if I had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so	113.1171646118164
Do you think so sir	79.36479949951172
And when I told you I had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit I alluded to	86.0877456665039
So much the better	27.378433227539062
Are you prepared	81.1405258178711
Yes sir	148.65170288085938
You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage	455.4408874511719
40262 m	71.39004516601562
Until one of us dies repeated Monte Cristo moving his head slightly up and down	100.87989807128906
Let us start then we need no witnesses	96.65278625488281
Very true said Monte Cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well	234.796630859375
On the contrary said the count we know so little of each other	149.20262145996094
Indeed said Monte Cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	240.684326171875
Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of Waterloo Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor Ali And have not all these Fernands united made LieutenantGeneral the Count of Morcerf peer of France	23.041088104248047
Oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretchto reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me No I did not say I was a stranger to you	49.52010726928711
I know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch I know not every page of my life but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings	1463.07373046875
Nono I am aware you know me but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery	305.01507568359375
You call yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo in Italy Sinbad the Sailor in Malta I forget what	133.93499755859375
But it is your real name I want to know in the midst of your hundred names that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when I plunge my sword through your heart	60.92760467529297
The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire	100.7060546875
He leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair	79.3086166381836
He returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand	147.29563903808594
Fernand cried he of my hundred names I need only tell you one to overwhelm you But you guess it now do you notor rather you remember it For notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures I show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with Mercds my betrothed	28.048816680908203
40268 m	31.3387451171875
The general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry	41.58644104003906
Edmond Dants	73.81900787353516
Then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligibleHome home	223.44960021972656
The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived	31.28765106201172
He stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	329.52252197265625
The door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment	100.5965347290039
Two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them	206.96310424804688
It was Mercds leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	90.60801696777344
They passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt Mercds dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words	97.40554809570312
Courage mother Come this is no longer our home	60.791446685791016
The words died away the steps were lost in the distance	86.47572326660156
The general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son	98.43904113769531
He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	168.94920349121094
He darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackneycoach drove on and the head of neither Mercds nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband	41.8843879699707
And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion	25.017398834228516
40270 m	168.01719665527344
Chapter 93	137.33502197265625
We may easily conceive where Morrels appointment was	132.61399841308594
On leaving Monte Cristo he walked slowly towards Villeforts we say slowly for Morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts	612.677734375
He knew his time wellthe hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty	60.91961669921875
Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission	248.4086456298828
He arrived Valentine was expecting him	228.27708435058594
Uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather	72.90386199951172
This uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report Morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the Opera was generally known	122.1201171875
No one at Villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	184.67489624023438
Valentine with her womans instinct guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	76.49343872070312
We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	154.5406494140625
Now said Valentine motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	44.955223083496094
You know Maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from M	412.0652160644531
de Villeforts	330.5038146972656
Yes said Maximilian I recollect the project of which I highly approved	123.97451782226562
Well said Valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it	145.82386779785156
Bravo said Maximilian	234.7971954345703
40272 m	40.42141342163086
And do you know said Valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house	658.62841796875
Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for Morrel	227.87989807128906
Oh whatever may be M	28.1529598236084
Noirtiers reason answered Morrel I can readily believe it to be a good one	161.53680419921875
An excellent one said Valentine	54.997459411621094
He pretends the air of the Faubourg SaintHonor is not good for me	129.47183227539062
Indeed said Morrel in that M	142.4689483642578
Noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight	164.92018127441406
Not very said Valentine	235.56748962402344
And grandpapa has become my physician and I have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything	1.1374945640563965
Do you then really suffer asked Morrel quickly	146.48934936523438
Oh it must not be called suffering I feel a general uneasiness that is all	67.5522689819336
I have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something	148.32528686523438
Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said	540.2259521484375
And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint	36.60629653930664
A very simple one said Valentine	57.5221061706543
I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather	165.20809936523438
When I say one spoonful I began by onenow I take four	84.38922119140625
Grandpapa says it is a panacea	55.50929641723633
Valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	155.75466918945312
Maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	70.35962677001953
She was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue	110.59568786621094
From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier	39.84843444824219
The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like Morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	190.5884552001953
But said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for M	137.600830078125
I know it is very bitter said Valentine so bitter that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste	95.48748779296875
Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter	442.50640869140625
Yes grandpapa said Valentine it is so	44.33948516845703
Just now before I came down to you I drank a glass of sugared water I left half because it seemed so bitter	137.02816772460938
Noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak	57.08859634399414
Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary	206.12673950195312
Noirtier watched her with evident anguish	85.23114013671875
In fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming red	162.9529571533203
Oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular I ca nt see Did the sun shine in my eyes And she leaned against the window	158.89491271972656
The sun is not shining said Morrel more alarmed by Noirtiers expression than by Valentines indisposition	203.52352905273438
He ran towards her	246.4477996826172
The young girl smiled	53.150962829589844
Cheer up said she to Noirtier	65.67927551269531
Do not be alarmed Maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	126.17591094970703
But listen Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard She opened Noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily	112.93644714355469
Yes said she it is Madame Danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us	252.15850830078125
GoodbyeI must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till I see you again	1.3601500988006592
Stay with grandpapa Maximilian I promise you not to persuade them to stay	70.72334289550781
40274 m	73.82857513427734
Morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villeforts apartments and to hers	217.69091796875
As soon as she was gone Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the dictionary	144.8143310546875
Morrel obeyed guided by Valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly	28.3658504486084
Accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words	58.68928146362305
Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentines room	103.522216796875
Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barroiss situation and in Noirtiers name gave that order	44.011104583740234
The servant soon returned	154.28744506835938
The decanter and the glass were completely empty	377.8628234863281
Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	23.675865173339844
Why are the glass and decanter empty asked he Valentine said she only drank half the glassful	266.5539245605469
The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	307.53607177734375
I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentines room perhaps she has emptied them	517.017822265625
Ask her said Morrel translating Noirtiers thought this time by his look	2446.98583984375
The servant went out but returned almost immediately	53.19026184082031
Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks	82.14287567138672
Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke	835.2329711914062
From that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	165.78038024902344
It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen they had been ushered into Madame de Villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	285.1337585449219
That is why Valentine passed through her room which was on a level with Valentines and only separated from it by Edwards	11.181358337402344
The two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	122.51223754882812
Among worldly people manner is contagious	149.05592346191406
Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemnity	10.93343448638916
Valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed	71.948486328125
My dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands I and Eugnie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti	175.40264892578125
Danglars kept up the title of prince	15373.16796875
The popular banker found that it answered better than count	153.15029907226562
Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied Madame de Villefort	153.276611328125
Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities	233.65597534179688
40276 m	253.783935546875
Listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be	190.86900329589844
He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize at first sight the Italian or German nobleman	232.49423217773438
Besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability M	165.0041046142578
Danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticthat is his word	87.29045867919922
And then said Eugnie while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villeforts album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man	186.31814575195312
And said Madame de Villefort I need not ask you if you share that fancy	97.94316101074219
I replied Eugnie with her usual candor	128.7713623046875
Oh not the least in the world madame My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought	32.08707809448242
Eugnie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentines cheeks	115.33059692382812
The timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman	16.985103607177734
At any rate said she since I am to be married whether I will or not I ought to be thankful to Providence for having released me from my engagement with M	128.4013214111328
Albert de Morcerf or I should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man	1.8864986896514893
It is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the Morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert	250.47349548339844
The general depended much on it he even came to force M	78.18963623046875
We have had a narrow escape	63.8348388671875
But said Valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general	109.19599151611328
Excuse me said the implacable young girl Monsieur Albert claims and well deserves his share	57.85575485229492
It appears that after having challenged M	380.8251647949219
de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today	50.085453033447266
Impossible said Madame de Villefort	48.993934631347656
Ah my dear friend said Madame Danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact	119.46841430664062
I heard it from M	72.53353118896484
Debray who was present at the explanation	1.7261881828308105
Valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer	174.32960510253906
A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting her in M	206.02395629882812
Noirtiers room	54.65177917480469
Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	64.72773742675781
She would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly Madame Danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy	127.78137969970703
What is it said she starting at Madame Danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	182.47254943847656
It is my dear Valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering	232.9632110595703
40280 m	380.9848327636719
I said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	1.2786369323730469
Yes look at yourself in that glass you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute	138.11830139160156
Indeed cried Eugnie you are very pale	246.91183471679688
Oh do not be alarmed I have been so for many days	61.660911560058594
Artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides Madame de Villefort came to her assistance	119.99698638916016
Retire Valentine said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink a glass of pure water it will restore you	111.90251159667969
Valentine kissed Eugnie bowed to Madame Danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out	13.297637939453125
That poor child said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness	35.68870544433594
Meanwhile Valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed Edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase	1627.6766357421875
She was within three steps of the bottom she already heard Morrels voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor	246.28768920898438
Morrel bounded to the door opened it and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs	57.196109771728516
Quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair	195.9480743408203
Valentine opened her eyes	82.64068603515625
Oh what a clumsy thing I am said she with feverish volubility I do nt know my way	92.54501342773438
I forgot there were three more steps before the landing	510.6037292480469
You have hurt yourself perhaps said Morrel	82.10469055175781
What can I do for you Valentine	57.74523162841797
Valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in Noirtiers eyes	181.2436065673828
Do nt worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile it is nothingit is nothing I was giddy that is all	130.3826904296875
Another attack of giddiness said Morrel clasping his hands	79.13967895507812
Oh attend to it Valentine I entreat you	433.8426513671875
But no said Valentineno I tell you it is all past and it was nothing	222.7222137451172
Now let me tell you some news Eugnie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival	51.49769973754883
We are all invited my father Madame de Villefort and Iat least I understood it so	339.63397216796875
When will it be our turn to think of these things Oh Valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answerSoon	132.55416870117188
And do you said Valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa	28.830049514770508
Yes cried Morrel make haste	132.70477294921875
So long as you are not mine Valentine I shall always think I may lose you	55.45138931274414
Oh replied Valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed Maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	224.60137939453125
Ha ha ha	137.4698028564453
She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless	69.40863800048828
The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtiers lips seemed to start from his eyes	207.42349243164062
Morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	194.6927032470703
The young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle Valentines room and the servant who had replaced Barrois ran in at the same moment	260.7509460449219
Valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help	382.9476623535156
Madame Danglars and Eugnie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance	359.7746887207031
I told you so exclaimed Madame de Villefort	107.3816909790039
Poor child	175.3118438720703
40278 m	166.9435577392578
Chapter 94	1.0454856157302856
Maximilians Avowal	63.332969665527344
At the same moment M	184.4608612060547
de Villeforts voice was heard calling from his study What is the matter	49.285194396972656
Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his selfcommand and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge	70.0837173461914
He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureurs footstep was heard in the passage	136.26406860351562
Villefort sprang into the room ran to Valentine and took her in his arms	89.06929016113281
A physician a physicianM	331.488525390625
dAvrigny cried Villefort or rather I will go for him myself	58.71449661254883
He flew from the apartment and Morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door	658.8929443359375
He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollectionthe conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame de SaintMrans death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois	198.6454620361328
At the same time Monte Cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before Whatever you want Morrel come to me I have great power	32.902164459228516
More rapidly than thought he darted down the Rue Matignon and thence to the Avenue des Champslyses	87.18263244628906
Meanwhile M	92.70114135742188
de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M	113.14693450927734
dAvrignys door	152.24386596679688
He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed	266.4639587402344
Villefort ran upstairs without saying a word	45.21955490112305
The porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him	223.32872009277344
In his study Monsieur Procureurin his study Villefort pushed or rather forced the door open	84.70960998535156
Ah said the doctor is it you	475.1776123046875
Yes said Villefort closing the door after him it is I who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone	22.5109920501709
Doctor my house is accursed	31.54146385192871
What said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid	47.57306671142578
Yes doctor cried Villefort clutching his hair yes	377.978515625
DAvrignys look implied I told you it would be so	69.29672241210938
Then he slowly uttered these words Who is now dying in your house What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God	90.21286010742188
A mournful sob burst from Villeforts heart he approached the doctor and seizing his armValentine said he it is Valentines turn	134.36715698242188
40284 m	14.070651054382324
Your daughter cried dAvrigny with grief and surprise	83.7801742553711
You see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her	48.56094741821289
Each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still I will go	371.66241455078125
But let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost	135.74240112304688
Oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness	100.96025848388672
This time I will know the assassin and will pursue him	455.8949890136719
Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said dAvrigny	157.3378448486328
The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristos door	529.7749633789062
The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste	2699.962890625
Hearing the name of Morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	76.94402313232422
What is the matter Maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead	92.27674865722656
Morrel fell into a chair	39.02750015258789
Yes said he I came quickly I wanted to speak to you	67.40923309326172
Are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt	105.8906478881836
Thank you countthank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation yes everyone in my family is well	32.27421951293945
So much the better yet you have something to tell me replied the count with increased anxiety	66.95578002929688
Yes said Morrel it is true I have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you	137.53326416015625
Are you then come from M	37.65790557861328
de Morcerfs asked Monte Cristo	190.40078735351562
No said Morrel is someone dead in his house	78.84076690673828
The general has just blown his brains out replied Monte Cristo with great coolness	98.86669158935547
Oh what a dreadful event cried Maximilian	207.8089141845703
Not for the countess or for Albert said Monte Cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored oneblood washes out shame	23.084400177001953
Poor countess said Maximilian I pity her very much she is so noble a woman	110.07121276855469
Pity Albert also Maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	68.47515106201172
But let us return to yourself	74.7021255493164
You have hastened to mecan I have the happiness of being useful to you	32.34102249145508
40286 m	5566.84765625
Yes I need your help that is I thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me	113.14580535888672
Tell me what it is replied Monte Cristo	121.18311309814453
Oh said Morrel I know not indeed if I may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count Morrel hesitated	58.1792106628418
Do you think I love you said Monte Cristo taking the young mans hand affectionately in his	43.311710357666016
Oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that I ought to have no secret from you	23.194412231445312
You are right Morrel God is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	97.80972290039062
Tell me what it says	135.2507781982422
Count will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone you know	96.17268371582031
I am at your service and still more my servants	78.68490600585938
Oh I can not live if she is not better	449.489013671875
Shall I ring for Baptistin	19.541135787963867
No I will go and speak to him myself	65.03948211669922
Morrel went out called Baptistin and whispered a few words to him	56.514068603515625
The valet ran directly	280.994140625
Well have you sent asked Monte Cristo seeing Morrel return	76.15729522705078
Yes and now I shall be more calm	95.09014129638672
You know I am waiting said Monte Cristo smiling	51.286659240722656
Yes and I will tell you	27.228397369384766
One evening I was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected I was there	285.0678405761719
Two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet I was so interested in what they said that I did not lose a single word	15.792069435119629
This is a gloomy introduction if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering Morrel	168.19691467285156
Oh yes very gloomy my friend	152.47947692871094
Someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	70.9416732788086
One of the persons whose conversation I overheard was the master of the house the other the physician	139.388427734375
The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of Gods anger	185.28819274902344
Ah indeed said Monte Cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilians face	201.79183959960938
Yes continued Morrel death had entered that house twice within one month	90.11702728271484
And what did the doctor answer asked Monte Cristo	322.12188720703125
He repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed	28.94779396057129
To what	554.1340942382812
To poison	244.917236328125
Indeed said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed Maximilian did you hear that	230.9063720703125
Yes my dear count I heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice	160.72622680664062
Monte Cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	1.0759191513061523
Well said Maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	329.4801025390625
Death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow	117.76914978027344
Count what am I bound to do being in possession of this secret	106.39753723144531
My dear friend said Monte Cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart	66.24880981445312
I know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths	92.46332550048828
Well I have not intercepted your confidence and yet I know all that as well as you and I have no conscientious scruples	273.782958984375
No it does not concern me	57.77299499511719
You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to Gods angerwell who says your supposition is not reality Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over	313.82159423828125
If it is Gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house Maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose	20.385398864746094
Morrel shuddered	149.93365478515625
There was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	318.91192626953125
Besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingbesides who says that it will begin again	145.91990661621094
It has returned count exclaimed Morrel that is why I hastened to you	65.47027587890625
Well what do you wish me to do Do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur Monte Cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that Morrel starting up cried out	163.42848205566406
You know of whom I speak count do you not	273.928955078125
Perfectly well my good friend and I will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons	112.5830307006836
You were walking one evening in M	160.74937438964844
de Villeforts garden from what you relate I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de SaintMrans death	92.87498474121094
You heard M	245.9621124267578
de Villefort talking to M	33.885990142822266
dAvrigny about the death of M	2163.9052734375
de SaintMran and that no less surprising of the countess	94.44795989990234
dAvrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret	28.08472442626953
We are no longer in the Middle Ages there is no longer a Vehmgericht or Free Tribunals what do you want to ask these people Conscience what hast thou to do with me as Sterne said	144.44515991210938
My dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you	55.59159851074219
Deep grief was depicted on Morrels features he seized Monte Cristos hand	63.596458435058594
But it is beginning again I say	376.0508117675781
Well said the Count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian let it begin againit is like the house of the Atreidae19 God has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment	1.1404001712799072
They will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them	175.48439025878906
Three months since it was M	99.2464599609375
de SaintMran Madame de SaintMran two months since the other day it was Barrois today the old Noirtier or young Valentine	218.96923828125
You knew it cried Morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte Cristo startedhe whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing	145.0697021484375
And what is it to me replied Monte Cristo shrugging his shoulders do I know those people and must I lose the one to save the other Faith no for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice	135.10214233398438
But I cried Morrel groaning with sorrow I love her	100.00376892089844
You lovewhom cried Monte Cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven	25.352001190185547
I love most fondlyI love madlyI love as a man who would give his lifeblood to spare her a tearI love Valentine de Villefort who is being murdered at this moment Do you understand me I love her and I ask God and you how I can save her	133.2010955810547
Monte Cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion	230.13450622558594
Unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love Valentinethat daughter of an accursed race	187.86972045898438
Never had Morrel witnessed such an expressionnever had so terrible an eye flashed before his facenever had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battlefield or in the murderous nights of Algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire	65.67774200439453
He drew back terrified	95.74240112304688
As for Monte Cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light	66.26966094970703
In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the suns genial influence when the cloud has passed	115.13755798339844
This silence selfcontrol and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face	80.84126281738281
See said he my dear friend how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view	215.64312744140625
I who was looking on an eager and curious spectatorI who was watching the working of this mournful tragedyI who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course I was watching and bitten to the heart	208.15322875976562
Morrel groaned	86.57560729980469
Come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for I am here and will watch over you	58.80766296386719
Morrel shook his head sorrowfully	78.98654174804688
I tell you to hope	98.62006378173828
Do you understand me cried Monte Cristo	112.99370574951172
Remember that I never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived	58.290645599365234
It is twelve oclock Maximilian thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning	62.295684814453125
Listen Morrelit is noon if Valentine is not now dead she will not die	18.90787124633789
How so cried Morrel when I left her dying	98.07952880859375
Monte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead	65.86177062988281
What was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous God only knows	93.14289855957031
Monte Cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep	29.454912185668945
Maximilian said he return home	1638.292236328125
I command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and I will send you tidings	1463.575439453125
Oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness	72.81867218017578
Have you then power against death Are you superhuman Are you an angel And the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before Monte Cristo with indescribable terror	163.33694458007812
But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes	549.2997436523438
I can do much for you my friend replied the count	363.4034118652344
Go I must be alone	111.98310852050781
Morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it	88.73174285888672
He pressed the counts hand and left	295.743408203125
He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin whom he saw in the Rue Matignon and who was running	188.01007080078125
Meanwhile Villefort and dAvrigny had made all possible haste Valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	212.9497833251953
Villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination	96.46442413330078
Noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than Villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately	148.18453979492188
At last dAvrigny slowly uttered these words She is still alive	80.4758071899414
Still cried Villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is that	994.861083984375
Yes said the physician I repeat it she is still alive and I am astonished at it	250.44900512695312
But is she safe asked the father	329.53851318359375
Yes since she lives	163.64122009277344
At that moment dAvrignys glance met Noirtiers eye	23.97317886352539
It glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck	101.18228912353516
He placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at Noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	239.6396942138672
Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort call Mademoiselle Valentines maid if you please	38.1539192199707
Villefort went himself to find her and dAvrigny approached Noirtier	67.26253509521484
Have you something to tell me asked he	842.0989379882812
The old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval	71.14387512207031
Well I will remain with you	90.29402160644531
At this moment Villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came Madame de Villefort	97.187255859375
What is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but I did not think seriously of it	85.73114776611328
The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached Valentine and took her hand	124.06623077392578
DAvrigny continued to look at Noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead	57.6195068359375
Ah said he involuntarily following Noirtiers eyes which were fixed on Madame de Villefort who repeated	264.2603759765625
This poor child would be better in bed	239.78335571289062
Come Fanny we will put her to bed	122.84613800048828
dAvrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered	150.42820739746094
They carried Valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack	91.60070037841797
She had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul	138.94110107421875
DAvrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters room	44.3618278503418
Then having renewed his injunction not to give Valentine anything he went down again to Noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening	35.4140510559082
Do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness	39.265602111816406
Yes said the old man	54.57946014404297
We have no time to lose I will question and do you answer me	74.7696533203125
Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	75.9549331665039
Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter	99.2701187133789
DAvrigny reflected a moment then approaching Noirtier	96.32832336425781
Pardon what I am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation	123.66260528564453
Did you see poor Barrois die Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven	72.84569549560547
Do you know of what he died asked dAvrigny placing his hand on Noirtiers shoulder	41.272552490234375
Yes replied the old man	334.9718017578125
Do you think he died a natural death A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirtier	36.60541534423828
Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned	104.98627471923828
Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him	61.102256774902344
Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine	78.81298828125
Then will she die too asked dAvrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirtier	350.90802001953125
He watched the effect of this question on the old man	239.19842529296875
No replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner	1.1510796546936035
Then you hope said dAvrigny with surprise	58.451663970947266
What do you hope The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	330.0902099609375
Ah yes it is true murmured dAvrigny	117.93948364257812
Then turning to NoirtierDo you hope the assassin will be tried	66.59095764160156
Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine	23.228113174438477
It is no news to you added dAvrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject	235.8896484375
Then how do you hope Valentine will escape	118.51801300048828
Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot	105.94458770751953
DAvrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning	56.327816009521484
Ah indeed said dAvrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youNoirtier did not let him finish	29.65682601928711
Yes said he	133.8059844970703
To prepare her system to resist poison	125.48182678222656
By accustoming her by degrees	188.99826049804688
Yes yes yes said Noirtier delighted to be understood	110.02293395996094
Of course	132.14385986328125
I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give you	117.1313247680664
And by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison Noirtiers joy continued	10.32320499420166
And you have succeeded exclaimed dAvrigny	51.898372650146484
Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured	474.6087951660156
The dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate Valentine will not die	96.66938018798828
A superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	544.9583129882812
At this moment Villefort returned	408.330322265625
Here doctor said he is what you sent me for	37.78956985473633
Was this prepared in your presence	108.93309783935547
Yes replied the procureur	303.6123352050781
Have you not let it go out of your hands	50.155548095703125
DAvrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them	84.58242797851562
Well said he let us go to Valentine I will give instructions to everyone and you M	55.11281204223633
de Villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them	24.781661987304688
40294 m	685.4068603515625
At the moment when dAvrigny was returning to Valentines room accompanied by Villefort an Italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of M	121.40706634521484
de Villefort	468.6204528808594
No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it	99.97506713867188
About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	85.84765625
The lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance	232.38528442382812
This new tenant who as we have said was an Italian was called Il Signor Giacomo Busoni	87.72721862792969
Workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house	130.6219482421875
Chapter 95	111.7087173461914
Father and Daughter	3459.28125
We saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to announce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugnie Danglars and M	110.91986083984375
Andrea Cavalcanti	67.41502380371094
This formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted	97.85880279541016
We beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner Baron Danglars	162.76974487304688
In this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	87.79488372802734
When his patience was exhausted he called his valet	251.2834930419922
tienne said he see why Mademoiselle Eugnie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so long	106.18791198730469
Having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the spot	454.2722473144531
The singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawingroom	110.27631378173828
tienne soon returned from his errand	274.3544616699219
Mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly	86.39814758300781
Danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	85.87001037597656
To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent father	55.89805221557617
This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performinga makeup he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic illtemper	278.0107727050781
Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father	27.68808937072754
Why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all	90.062255859375
He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and Eugnie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the Italian Opera	69.80463409423828
Well Eugnie what is it you want with me and why in this solemn drawingroom when the study is so comfortable	170.63623046875
I quite understand why you ask sir said Eugnie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation	317.0843200683594
I will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult	148.22694396972656
I have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers study	116.1649398803711
Those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bankbills come from I know not where and the quantities of letters from England Holland Spain India China and Peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	192.34437561035156
I have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals	192.3175048828125
I rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies	65.52009582519531
Very well replied M	71.24483489990234
Danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker	622.4960327148438
There is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said Eugnie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation	89.76646423339844
Now let us return to the first	59.80751037597656
You ask me why I have requested this interview I will tell you in two words sir I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti	235.98550415039062
Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	1.2153712511062622
40298 m	95.70880126953125
Yes indeed sir continued Eugnie still quite calm you are astonished I see for since this little affair began I have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet I am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	131.6170654296875
However this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience	31.790082931518555
Well asked Danglars	69.45760345458984
Well sir replied Eugnie I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible	93.34786987304688
But said Danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal Eugnie what reason do you assign	15.784826278686523
My reason replied the young girl	5.184696197509766
Well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no M	193.9279327392578
Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind	49.96995544433594
It is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which I consider quite beneath me	215.3382568359375
I actually love no one sir you know it do you not I do not then see why without real necessity I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion	132.27560424804688
Has not some sage said Nothing too much and another I carry all my effects with me I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek one is I believe from Phdrus and the other from Bias	182.19032287597656
Well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesI cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and I remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free	61.876426696777344
Unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured Danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	126.46527862548828
Unhappy girl replied Eugnie unhappy girl do you say sir No indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected	157.26614379882812
Happy on the contrary for what am I in want of The world calls me beautiful	35.48957061767578
It is something to be well received	136.26953125
I like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly	72.61659240722656
I possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all I meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents	123.74624633789062
I am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in France	106.86027526855469
I am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the Porte SaintMartin and Gat who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	120.85771179199219
Besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That	106.56067657470703
And sobeing beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and richand that is happiness sirwhy do you call me unhappy	218.61891174316406
Danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation	121.36591339111328
Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	83.46449279785156
Truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing I will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it	99.78927612304688
Eugnie looked at Danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed	227.53961181640625
My daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry	306.4748840332031
Eugnie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion	232.63031005859375
My daughter continued Danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	78.6109848022461
Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren	169.59014892578125
This is not my weakness I tell you at once family joys have no charm for me	280.5727844238281
I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime	87.05801391601562
This is not to the purpose said Eugnie let us speak candidly sir I admire candor	32.01131820678711
Oh said Danglars I can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice	54.30200958251953
I will therefore proceed	196.8723602294922
I have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied I hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations I am desirous of entering into	74.7398910522461
Eugnie became uneasy	125.98821258544922
40302 m	74.08524322509766
It is just as I tell you I assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure	145.79229736328125
I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and sensations	109.13810729980469
But in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	208.18898010253906
There one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility I will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and M	84.40531158447266
de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which I have never forgotten	54.07597732543945
There we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter	70.22465515136719
But Eugnie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow	42.29827117919922
Ruined said she	117.45542907714844
Exactly my daughter that is precisely what I mean said Danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedyes that is it	85.44363403320312
Ah said Eugnie	490.6612854003906
Yes ruined Now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says	355.5667419433594
Now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you	351.6428527832031
Oh cried Eugnie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me	70.04900360107422
I ruined and what will that signify to me Have I not my talent left Can I not like Pasta Malibran Grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers And if I do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should I not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of selfpreservation No I grieve not on my own account I shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which I shall be able to procure will remain my own	36.84096908569336
Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars Undeceive yourself again either I am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting her	70.30841827392578
She has taken care for herselfat least I hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me	120.63868713378906
She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty	96.58538055419922
Oh no sir from my childhood I have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me	127.54390716552734
From my earliest recollections I have been beloved by no oneso much the worse that has naturally led me to love no oneso much the betternow you have my profession of faith	81.79415893554688
Then said Danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal lovethen mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin	111.70504760742188
Your ruin I accelerate your ruin What do you mean I do not understand you	32.72477722167969
So much the better I have a ray of hope left listen	291.0780944824219
I am all attention said Eugnie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze	10.425599098205566
Cavalcanti continued Danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres	75.92523956298828
That is admirable said Eugnie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other	69.51229858398438
You think I shall deprive you of those three millions said Danglars but do not fear it	79.98825073242188
They are destined to produce at least ten	56.969242095947266
I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians in the fantastic Mississippi scheme	49.46825408935547
As I look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the Ohio	141.90756225585938
We make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money	227.1819305419922
Well within a week I am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions I promise you will produce ten or twelve	60.79538345336914
But during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied Eugnie I saw you arranging a depositis not that the termof five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning	112.41394805908203
Yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time I should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses I have recently sustained are well known and as I told you my credit is rather shaken	148.17677307128906
That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if I had employed it for another purpose I should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy	47.1308479309082
I do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin	43.2762565612793
Now if you marry M	127.20639038085938
Cavalcanti and I get the three millions or even if it is thought I am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	68.5135269165039
Do you understand me	118.08033752441406
Perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not	108.041259765625
The greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value	235.81295776367188
Thank you	313.0450134277344
One word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune M	114.10099792480469
Cavalcanti will bring without touching the money This is no act of selfishness but of delicacy	49.27987289428711
I am willing to help rebuild your fortune but I will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others	73.76496124267578
But since I tell you cried Danglars that with these three million	153.54632568359375
Do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million	9587.1552734375
I hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit	70.5656967163086
Shall you be able to pay M	109.66378784179688
Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry	115.67487335205078
He shall receive them on returning from the mayors20	146.14797973632812
Very well	59.09457778930664
What next what more do you want	77.19678497314453
I wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person	133.14425659179688
Then as I said before sirvery well I am ready to marry M	60.594444274902344
But what are you up to	192.37161254882812
Ah that is my affair	56.069061279296875
What advantage should I have over you if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine	964.676513671875
Danglars bit his lips	65.87157440185547
Then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable	119.21017456054688
Yes replied Eugnie	133.51287841796875
And to sign the contract in three days	31.32341957092285
Then in my turn I also say very well	17.171953201293945
Danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	160.73487854003906
But extraordinary to relate the father did not say Thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	39.35836410522461
Is the conference ended asked Eugnie rising	160.83937072753906
Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	60.05834197998047
Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle dArmillys fingers and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantios malediction on Desdemona	108.8449935913086
At the end of the piece tienne entered and announced to Eugnie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits	49.74073028564453

The Contract	1.6948373317718506
Three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five oclock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristos house and the count was preparing to go out	41.69073486328125
While his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrancegate and cast out on the doorsteps M	117.71407318115234
Andrea Cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess	89.1247787475586
He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs	117.62374114990234
The count stopped on seeing the young man	120.9649429321289
As for Andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	78.83967590332031
Ah good morning my dear count said he	243.18130493164062
Ah M	46.58843231201172
Andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do	190.6589813232422
Charmingly as you see	76.86158752441406
I am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned	48.2552604675293
I was going out sir	29.703960418701172
Then in order not to hinder you I will get up with you if you please in your carriage and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow	45.21196365356445
No said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young mans societyno I prefer listening to you here my dear M	126.72695922851562
Andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation	100.80657196044922
The count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also	51.87238311767578
Andrea assumed his gayest manner	75.55310821533203
You know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	34.2639274597168
At nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherinlaws	19.665821075439453
Ah indeed said Monte Cristo	1.3129456043243408
What is it news to you Has not M	76.39607238769531
Danglars informed you of the ceremony	83.35599517822266
Oh yes said the count I received a letter from him yesterday but I do not think the hour was mentioned	68.22517395019531
Possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety	78.46471405029297
Well said Monte Cristo you are fortunate M	60.186431884765625
Cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl	32.854339599609375
Yes indeed she is replied Cavalcanti in a very modest tone	115.46595764160156
Above all she is very richat least I believe so said Monte Cristo	32.62958908081055
Very rich do you think replied the young man	107.45452880859375
Doubtless it is said M	39.8318977355957
Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune	171.5199432373047
And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy	88.58390045166016
Without reckoning added Monte Cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England but quite novel in France	64.01007080078125
Yes yes I know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not	150.2510528564453
Precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair	49.831512451171875
Ten millions Do you think so It is magnificent said Cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words	177.9033660888672
Without reckoning replied Monte Cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only daughter	47.06476593017578
Besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed	35.55056381225586
But enough of money matters	66.97209930419922
Do you know M	72.0899429321289
Andrea I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully	5.9566264152526855
Not badly by any means said the young man I was born for a diplomatist	297.9846496582031
Well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive	128.63365173339844
Have you lost your heart	94.95325469970703
Indeed I fear it replied Andrea in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valre reply to Alceste21 at the Thtre Franais	37.54655838012695
Is your love returned	21.742345809936523
I suppose so said Andrea with a triumphant smile since I am accepted	61.76714324951172
But I must not forget one grand point	116.71974182128906
That I have been singularly assisted	17.882566452026367
I have indeed	70.85440826416016
By circumstances	142.14242553710938
No by you	52.61659240722656
By me Not at all prince said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have I done for you Are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient	104.58150482177734
No said Andreano it is useless for you to say so count	115.74213409423828
I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit	167.74325561523438
You are completely mistaken sir said Monte Cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintancetwo of my good friends Lord Wilmore and the Abb Busoni	60.076927185058594
What encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in Italy and so highly honored	1.343234896659851
Personally I do not know you	1053.9576416015625
This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	118.43829345703125
Oh then my father has really a very large fortune count	258.783447265625
It appears so sir replied Monte Cristo	526.3545532226562
Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come	67.9857406616211
I have been advised of it	92.84256744384766
But the three millions	127.81617736816406
The three millions are probably on the road	133.66238403320312
Then I shall really have them	141.60379028320312
Oh well said the count I do not think you have yet known the want of money	356.620361328125
Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment	56.232173919677734
Then arousing from his reverie	292.91094970703125
Now sir I have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you	141.3031005859375
Proceed said Monte Cristo	158.21304321289062
I have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends	194.7850799560547
But marrying as I am about to do before all Paris I ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to Paris is he	36.310546875
He is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling	90.24009704589844
I understand well I am come to ask a favor of you	29.41535186767578
Of me	35.025020599365234
Yes of you	378.046630859375
And pray what may it be	64.95415496826172
Well to take his part	63.70861053466797
Ah my dear sir Whatafter the varied relations I have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing Ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less Know then what I thought I had already told you that in participation in this worlds affairs more especially in their moral aspects the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the East	135.3855743408203
I who have a seraglio at Cairo one at Smyrna and one at Constantinople preside at a weddingnever	102.83519744873047
Then you refuse me	217.52023315429688
Decidedly and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same way	195.67832946777344
But what must be done said Andrea disappointed	41.67302703857422
You said just now that you had a hundred friends	143.04714965820312
Very true but you introduced me at M	200.32566833496094
Not at all Let us recall the exact facts	119.4069595336914
You met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair	63.74197769165039
Yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that	174.9827117919922
Inot in the least I beg you to believe	145.13951110839844
Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose you	36.429073333740234
Oh I never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle	188.57321166992188
Andrea bit his lips	145.9114227294922
50025 m	285.53253173828125
But at least you will be there	236.90811157226562
Will all Paris be there	1.0858538150787354
Oh certainly	97.50638580322266
Well like all Paris I shall be there too said the count	1716.757568359375
And will you sign the contract	85.10707092285156
I see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far	37.28472137451172
Well since you will grant me no more I must be content with what you give me	160.57537841796875
But one word more count	74.14192199707031
What is it	106.78749084472656
Be careful advice is worse than a service	170.83984375
Oh you can give me this without compromising yourself	894.1731567382812
Tell me what it is	180.52452087402344
Is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres	95.741943359375
That is the sum M	100.4213638305664
Danglars himself announced	26.308252334594727
Must I receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary	4.598506927490234
This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly Your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance	139.57997131347656
Because said Andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness I thought I heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now	100.66990661621094
Well replied Monte Cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	113.19275665283203
Baron Danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate	58.66171646118164
In that case said Andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me	394.3480529785156
You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances	193.2979278564453
Well said Andrea let it be as you wish	179.8224334716797
This evening then at nine oclock	112.53559112548828
Adieu till then	42.034202575683594
Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile Andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared	101.15850830078125
The four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived Andrea employed in riding paying visitsdesigned to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest equipagesdazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which Danglars was just taking the initiative	1.134756326675415
In fact at halfpast eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawingrooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen	105.18580627441406
An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones	1188.7470703125
50025 m	80.89752960205078
No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	264.6097412109375
Mademoiselle Eugnie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel	50.67313766479492
Her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	110.46761322021484
Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	985.3861083984375
Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	48.59422302246094
Danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	195.2196044921875
Andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	119.27220916748047
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	67.33804321289062
As usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous	154.28294372558594
If there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparadise	73.32781219482422
At each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	24.83673095703125
But for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain	79.59685516357422
At the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing Endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	81.21868133544922
The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	59.06883239746094
His only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat	9.943808555603027
A circle was immediately formed around the door	5.9566264152526855
The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawingroom M	62.96878433227539
Danglars at the other and Eugnie in front of him	202.6705322265625
He first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with Madame de Villefort who had come alone Valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to Eugnie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	6822.81689453125
Near her was Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy which she intended immediately to make use of	52.201873779296875
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars who had advanced to meet him	92.41558837890625
Having accomplished these three social duties Monte Cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say I have done my duty now let others do theirs	23.979610443115234
Andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count	5.9566264152526855
He found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	78.49049377441406
The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws	31.37458610534668
One of the notaries sat down the other remained standing	98.19993591308594
They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half Paris assembled was to sign	211.650146484375
All took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the style nergique commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea on M	104.47583770751953
Danglars riveted attention Eugnies composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair	277.9903564453125
The contract was read during a profound silence	70.16788482666016
But as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawingrooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladys diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly	1.0454856157302856
Mademoiselle Danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor	96.08609771728516
As for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them	106.2186508178711
Andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered	111.47911071777344
The notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said	24.668546676635742
Gentlemen we are about to sign the contract	61.51102828979492
The baron was to sign first then the representative of M	18.216299057006836
Cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents	66.28413391113281
The baron took the pen and signed then the representative	34.93806838989258
The baroness approached leaning on Madame de Villeforts arm	73.08088684082031
My dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious An unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M	23.222192764282227
de Villefort	104.70899200439453
Indeed said M	128.3232879638672
Danglars in the same tone in which he would have said Oh well what do I care	25.39859962463379
As a matter of fact said Monte Cristo approaching I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence	146.20791625976562
What you count said Madame Danglars signing if you are take care for I shall never forgive you	86.9949722290039
Andrea pricked up his ears	68.23021697998047
But it is not my fault as I shall endeavor to prove	108.929931640625
Everyone listened eagerly Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	52.36619186401367
You remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it	64.65937805175781
Yes said Danglars	16.907697677612305
In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked	196.72344970703125
Andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm	40.91032028198242
Well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart	251.78773498535156
The ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint	155.06785583496094
It was brought to me	96.67560577392578
No one could guess what the dirty rag could be I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man	16.632354736328125
My valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you baron	34.10190200805664
To me cried Danglars	67.46168518066406
Yes indeed to you I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied Monte Cristo amid the general outburst of amazement	127.93746185302734
But asked Madame Danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent M	85.02404022216797
de Villefort	243.1465301513672
In this simple way madame replied Monte Cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence I therefore sent them to the kings attorney	280.67193603515625
You understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against you	83.18485260009766
Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawingroom	87.51939392089844
Possibly said Danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave	15.64870834350586
50025 m	85.62611389160156
Yes replied the count a felon named Caderousse	88.64077758789062
Danglars turned slightly pale Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawingroom	143.5020294189453
But go on signing said Monte Cristo I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and I beg to apologize to you baroness and to Mademoiselle Danglars	81.41930389404297
The baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary	130.57798767089844
Prince Cavalcanti said the latter Prince Cavalcanti where are you	71.05189514160156
Andrea Andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name	1.109410285949707
Call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried Danglars to one of the floorkeepers	171.04086303710938
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments qurens quem devoret	88.81135559082031
There was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	160.43402099609375
An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards Danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	60.59796905517578
Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted	61.72492599487305
Danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calmDanglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror	75.17326354980469
What is the matter sir asked Monte Cristo advancing to meet the commissioner	81.88883209228516
Which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti	87.46691131591797
A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	296.20758056640625
They searched they questioned	231.25103759765625
But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti asked Danglars in amazement	63.95478820800781
A galleyslave escaped from confinement at Toulon	52.27849578857422
And what crime has he committed	69.4720687866211
He is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named Caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the Count of Monte Cristo	1.0190907716751099
Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him	7.813769340515137
Andrea was gone	42.05485153198242
Chapter 97	161.3889923095703
The Departure for Belgium	1885.291259765625
A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M	122.6238021850586
Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests	147.13522338867188
In a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	39.76239776611328
There remained in the bankers house only Danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes Madame Danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and Eugnie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	39.90050506591797
As for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Caf de Paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted	257.01409912109375
Of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	125.08145904541016
The betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	6.7660040855407715
On reaching her room Eugnie locked her door while Louise fell on a chair	59.952613830566406
Ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician who would have suspected it M	92.26016235351562
Andrea Cavalcanti a murderera galleyslave escapeda convict	55.16771697998047
An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugnie	23.876523971557617
In truth I was fated said she	166.29879760742188
I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti	56.67574691772461
Oh do not confound the two Eugnie	66.05406188964844
Hold your tongue The men are all infamous and I am happy to be able now to do more than detest themI despise them	81.46156311035156
What shall we do asked Louise	48.2535514831543
What shall we do	65.59114837646484
Why the same we had intended doing three days sinceset off	62.17093276977539
Whatalthough you are not now going to be married you intend still	146.81719970703125
Listen Louise	614.8859252929688
I hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our musicpaper	13345.0576171875
What I have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself	253.7395477294922
Remain here What forthat they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whomM	147.61154174804688
Debray perhaps as it was once proposed	71.28605651855469
No Louise no This evenings adventure will serve for my excuse	117.08285522460938
I did not seek one I did not ask for one	376.46685791015625
God sends me this and I hail it joyfully	64.15473175048828
How strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion	108.2925033569336
Did you not yet know me Come Louise let us talk of our affairs	29.70231819152832
The postchaise	161.720458984375
Was happily bought three days since	61.326141357421875
Have you had it sent where we are to go for it	107.797607421875
Our passport	88.14106750488281
Here it is	127.69111633300781
And Eugnie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read	88.48493957519531
Lon dArmilly twenty years of age profession artist hair black eyes black travelling with his sister	253.35592651367188
Capital How did you get this passport	49.6077995300293
When I went to ask M	282.45977783203125
de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at Rome and Naples I expressed my fears of travelling as a woman he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a mans passport and two days after I received this to which I have added with my own hand travelling with his sister	67.60720825195312
50035 m	133.4313507080078
Well said Eugnie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the weddingthat is all	273.0334777832031
But consider the matter seriously Eugnie	125.68087768554688
Oh I am done with considering I am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of Spanish funds of Haitian bonds	64.98284149169922
Instead of that Louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of Lombardy Venetian canals Roman palaces the Bay of Naples	113.31609344482422
How much have we Louise	68.15169525146484
The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twentythree banknotes	168.43263244628906
Twentythree thousand francs said she	81.06380462646484
And as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said Eugnie	97.63382720947266
We are rich	979.7496948242188
With fortyfive thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and I with my voicewe shall double our capital	25.59709930419922
Come you shall take charge of the money I of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left	100.53630065917969
Now the portmanteaulet us make hastethe portmanteau	35.578392028808594
Stop said Louise going to listen at Madame Danglars door	19.240018844604492
What do you fear	148.11538696289062
That we may be discovered	33.28689956665039
The door is locked	79.83636474609375
They may tell us to open it	1.166452407836914
They may if they like but we will not	25.878690719604492
You are a perfect Amazon Eugnie And the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require	9.44405460357666
There now said Eugnie while I change my costume do you lock the portmanteau	598.5269775390625
Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau	14.590106010437012
But I can not said she I am not strong enough do you shut it	98.91426849365234
Ah you do well to ask said Eugnie laughing I forgot that I was Hercules and you only the pale Omphale	139.18101501464844
And the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and Mademoiselle dArmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	92.83734130859375
When this was done Eugnie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	325.2602233886719
Here said she you see I have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold	5.963573455810547
But you	127.26766967773438
Oh I am never cold you know Besides with these mens clothes	170.15740966796875
Will you dress here	14.087384223937988
Shall you have time	62.1915397644043
Do not be uneasy you little coward All our servants are busy discussing the grand affair	61.06156921386719
Besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief I ought to be in that I shut myself uptell me	103.60057830810547
No trulyyou comfort me	58.69020080566406
Come and help me	40.10770034790039
From the same drawer she took a mans complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite	47.03005599975586
Then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex Eugnie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure	62.45329284667969
Oh that is very goodindeed it is very good said Louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envywill they go under a mans hat like the one I see down there	217.66619873046875
You shall see said Eugnie	81.2403335571289
And with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	48.478919982910156
Then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows	19.661056518554688
50039 m	157.02088928222656
Oh the magnificent hair said Louise with regret	87.97869110107422
And am I not a hundred times better thus cried Eugnie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so	60.64268493652344
Oh you are beautifulalways beautiful cried Louise	110.29171752929688
Now where are you going	23.56064224243164
To Brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier	17.6353759765625
We can go to Brussels Lige AixlaChapelle then up the Rhine to Strasbourg	1090.720458984375
We will cross Switzerland and go down into Italy by the SaintGothard	375.27197265625
Will that do	3.156029224395752
What are you looking at	89.50463104248047
I am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that One would say you were carrying me off	50.627681732177734
And they would be right pardieu	246.8799285888672
Oh I think you swore Eugnie	7.053044319152832
And the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	30.919143676757812
Then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressingroom which led by a side staircase down to the yardEugnie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle dArmilly scarcely raised with both hands	58.934234619140625
The yard was empty the clock was striking twelve	126.0248031616211
The porter was not yet gone to bed	165.6865692138672
Eugnie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge	255.7189178466797
She returned to Louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall	28.97748565673828
Eugnie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person	387.74676513671875
Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard	128.3919677734375
Gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	217.2510223388672
The porter got up as Eugnie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it immediately	364.57672119140625
Louise slid through the halfopen gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward	81.59727478027344
Eugnie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn	123.42560577392578
A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to No	93.514404296875
36 Rue de la Victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted Louise	26.75991439819336
As for Eugnie she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah	65.40753173828125
They arrived at the appointed spot	31.122812271118164
Eugnie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away	55.2577018737793
The shutter where Eugnie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed	36.77992248535156
She opened the door	76.19536590576172
Mademoiselle said Eugnie let the porter get the postchaise from the coachhouse and fetch some posthorses from the hotel	89.4344482421875
Here are five francs for his trouble	94.50999450683594
Indeed said Louise I admire you and I could almost say respect you	56.227317810058594
The laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark	129.6124267578125
In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a postboy and horses which were harnessed and put in the postchaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap	19.44537353515625
Here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman	139.0324249267578
To Fontainebleau replied Eugnie with an almost masculine voice	95.5191421508789
What do you say said Louise	75.7801284790039
I am giving them the slip said Eugnie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction	12.541698455810547
And the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step	92.25220489501953
You are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend	111.25808715820312
A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the Barrire SaintMartin	21.943090438842773
Ah said Louise breathing freely here we are out of Paris	111.23453521728516
Yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied Eugnie	213.75807189941406
Yes and without violence said Louise	103.08686065673828
I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied Eugnie	146.3994140625
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Villette	127.19358825683594
Danglars no longer had a daughter	50.89686965942383
Chapter 98	68.40489196777344

And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune	95.04068756103516
Notwithstanding his youth Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	173.94639587402344
We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared	65.97483825683594
But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the brideelect was on exhibition	4.9034295082092285
There were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls Valenciennes lace English veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the corbeille	105.39974212646484
22 Now in passing through this room Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him	37.48155975341797
Furnished with this plunder Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes	69.66609954833984
Tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a Spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken	111.78880310058594
Having passed through the Rue du MontBlanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the Rue La Fayette	78.46265411376953
There he stopped breathless and panting	787.017578125
He was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the SaintLazare on the other Paris enshrouded in darkness	234.4585418701172
Am I to be captured he cried no not if I can use more activity than my enemies	249.3379669189453
My safety is now a mere question of speed	168.9640350341797
At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnire	196.50808715820312
The dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg SaintDenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station	100.74375915527344
Ho friend said Benedetto	239.49163818359375
What do you want sir asked the driver	63.046932220458984
Is your horse tired	24.87828254699707
Tired oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day Four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that I have earned and I ought to take ten to the owner	58.6208381652832
Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have	156.32252502441406
With pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be despised	108.03543853759766
Tell me what I am to do for this	93.0588150024414
A very easy thing if your horse is nt tired	129.99754333496094
I tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to drive	45.8150520324707
Towards the Louvres	77.95684051513672
Ah I know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over there	128.45497131347656
Exactly so I merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at ChapelleenServal	44.95131301879883
He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on	97.00007629394531
It is likely	55.23278045654297
Well will you try and overtake him	181.1324920654297
Nothing I should like better	97.35418701171875
If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before Louvres thirty	169.6898193359375
And if we do overtake him	112.74935150146484
Forty said Andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise	137.29409790039062
That s all right said the man hop in and were off Whooopla	72.80648803710938
Andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the Faubourg SaintDenis along the Faubourg SaintMartin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable Villette	3772.55224609375
They never overtook the chimerical friend yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the Low Countries and as ninetenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	88.63274383544922
Everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend	62.380550384521484
Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posthorses	162.60598754882812
Ah said Cavalcanti to himself if I only had that britzka those two good posthorses and above all the passport that carries them on And he sighed deeply	1.1284620761871338
The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArmilly	9.41748046875
Hurry hurry said Andrea we must overtake him soon	218.1986846923828
And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at Louvres	187.158447265625
Certainly said Andrea I shall not overtake my friend but I shall kill your horse therefore I had better stop	588.9070434570312
Here are thirty francs I will sleep at the Cheval Rouge and will secure a place in the first coach	488.5174865722656
Goodnight friend	78.17118072509766
And Andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the pathway	20.568382263183594
The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to Paris	105.79688262939453
Andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the Cheval Rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues	145.5142059326172
Then he rested he must be near ChapelleenServal where he pretended to be going	43.395145416259766
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan	117.8937759399414
It would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was necessary	63.559505462646484
It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in France this was quite out of the question especially to a man like Andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	80.87804412841797
He sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected	22.526866912841797
Ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	208.8157196044922
He threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to ChapelleenServal he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	42.413753509521484
The host opened	39.95668029785156
My friend said Andrea I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me	63.48238754272461
I must reach Compigne tonight or I shall cause deep anxiety to my family	44.89634323120117
Could you let me hire a horse of you	1.0454856157302856
An innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad	11.188713073730469
The host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle Le Blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	104.20816040039062
Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card	53.502071380615234
This belonged to one of his friends at the Caf de Paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after Andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Maulon 25 Rue SaintDominique that being the name and address on the card	74.94416809082031
Le Blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from Compigne and four oclock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop	56.25566482543945
There is an excellent tavern at Compigne well remembered by those who have ever been there	483.9906005859375
Andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about Paris recollected the Bell and Bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper	231.2784881591797
A waiter opened the door	255.0132598876953
My friend said Andrea I have been dining at SaintJeanauxBois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool I have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	51.02226638793945
Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux	31804.103515625
The waiter had no suspicions Andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all	95.35467529296875
While the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose Andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have No	6598.80224609375
3 which he had occupied on his last stay at Compigne	126.7713851928711
Unfortunately No	44.303749084472656
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister	49.019287109375
Andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that No	445.7924499511719
7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as No	75.33499908447266
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	213.72952270507812
Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the Bell Hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine	1.2540373802185059
The fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened	246.3063507080078
Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	1186.5537109375
Now here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not	71.6646728515625
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	277.4524230957031
Before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lions skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time	254.9600067138672
Once past the frontier Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten banknotes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	30.142187118530273
Moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures	141.13111877441406
These were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused Andrea to sleep so soundly	154.667236328125
In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and longpointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him	43.91363525390625
About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face	23.57874298095703
In all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	148.14553833007812
Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long	76.10324096679688
He jumped out of bed and ran to the window	30.472570419311523
A gendarme was crossing the court	4.039363384246826
A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	375.8306579589844
Why is that gendarme there asked Andrea of himself	63.16624450683594
Then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself	811.6258544921875
And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris	102.07726287841797
Now then said Andrea while dressing himself Ill wait till he leaves and then Ill slip away	1100.7525634765625
50047 m	90.14358520507812
And saying this Andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain	1551.4967041015625
Not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great streetdoor which alone afforded the means of egress	85.17263793945312
The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel	46.62049865722656
They re after me was Andreas first thought	70.41145324707031
A pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety	35.4537467956543
His room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody	329.50079345703125
I am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in Andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	166.84193420410156
For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks	52.411685943603516
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and paper	118.25635528564453
With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper	676.8001098632812
I have no money to pay my bill but I am not a dishonest man I leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount	98.47134399414062
I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for I was ashamed	48.650238037109375
He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper	116.28165435791016
This done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimneyboard which represented Achilles with Deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left	31.109582901000977
At this precise time the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door	82.46127319335938
Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances	228.13670349121094
At daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse	292.35687255859375
Compigne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the Bell and Bottle being the bestknown hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there	43.5059814453125
Now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Htel de Ville which is next door to the Bell and Bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	122.23529052734375
The sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him	82.49391174316406
The young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance	65.99166870117188
This late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than Andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	321.5672607421875
They found the door ajar	89.14356994628906
Oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open I would rather find it triply bolted	236.08343505859375
And indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth	529.8439331054688
Andrea had fled	36.19202423095703
We say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof	280.8677978515625
He glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney	161.2198486328125
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation	2196.441650390625
The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	51.53474044799805
The fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	90.55842590332031
The fact was that Andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimneypots	685.1248779296875
50049 m	108.05542755126953
At one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes He is not here But venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	77.80718231201172
It was now his turn to look about him the Htel de Ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings	34.35863494873047
If once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room	197.003173828125
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone	154.2921600341797
At the same minute one of the little windows of the Htel de Ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	451.48284912109375
For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared	1.8883540630340576
The brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the hotel	100.25247192382812
Well asked the two gendarmes	87.13109588623047
Well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the VillersCoterets and Noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt	62.46702194213867
The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel	469.1203308105469
Ah what is that cried the brigadier	54.47222137451172
Some traveller seems impatient said the host	2.9535200595855713
What number was it that rang	81.10625457763672
Number 3	124.64776611328125
Run waiter	75.9490966796875
At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled	28.912729263305664
Aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme	162.907958984375
Who occupies Number 3	267.3079528808594
The little fellow who arrived last night in a postchaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds	168.87196350097656
The bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish	113.9796142578125
Follow me Mr	312.7133483886719
Commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps	170.2924041748047
Wait an instant said the host Number 3 has two staircasesinside and outside	100.67758178710938
Good said the brigadier	97.0997543334961
I will take charge of the inside one	62.661624908447266
Are the carbines loaded	596.0509033203125
Yes brigadier	169.22415161132812
Well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says	49.59480285644531
The brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd	71.52033996582031
This is what had happened Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	58.27005386352539
It would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	38.911865234375
Two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man	88.60169219970703
One of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bellrope rang with all her strength	31.46514320373535
Andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune	167.92684936523438
For pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressingfor pitys sake do not call assistance Save meI will not harm you	79.93262481689453
Andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies	335.7963562011719
Eugnie Mademoiselle Danglars exclaimed Andrea stupefied	1.0325813293457031
Help help cried Mademoiselle dArmilly taking the bell from her companions hand and ringing it yet more violently	65.4542007446289
Save me I am pursued said Andrea clasping his hands	251.13027954101562
For pity for mercys sake do not deliver me up	801.7899780273438
It is too late they are coming said Eugnie	153.8729248046875
Well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life	26.117639541625977
50053 m	112.84815979003906
The two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds	82.01270294189453
Well be it so at length said Eugnie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch	26.257808685302734
Here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is I see him	95.59136199951172
The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty	150.4550323486328
A violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	25.796194076538086
Andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand	68.4891586303711
Fly then cried Mademoiselle dArmilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly	49.4017219543457
Or kill yourself said Eugnie in a tone which a Vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary	121.73075866699219
Andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor	89.18059539794922
Kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should I do so	93.2334976196289
Why you said answered Mademoiselle Danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals	85.50726318359375
50055 m	52.80009078979492
Bah said Cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends	38.90156936645508
The brigadier advanced to him sword in hand	20.68834114074707
Come come said Andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such a fuss since I give myself up and he held out his hands to be manacled	55.2271728515625
The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galleyslave	71.72665405273438
Andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked Have you any message for your father Mademoiselle Danglars for in all probability I shall return to Paris	48.478004455566406
Eugnie covered her face with her hands	85.71847534179688
Oh oh said Andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me	56.43131637573242
Was I not nearly your husband	33.223388671875
50056 m	36.85218048095703
And with this raillery Andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	138.4272003173828
An hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire	105.16082763671875
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	1.0868563652038574
Eugnie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage	176.16314697265625
Oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle dArmilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow	43.91817855834961
The next day they stopped at the Htel de Flandre at Brussels	50.89608383178711
The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie	160.80010986328125
Chapter 99	246.54052734375
The Law	125.43235778808594
We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	143.96115112304688
We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser Lucien Debray	49.112606048583984
The baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of Eugnies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	30.368528366088867
Now Madame Danglars feared Eugnies sagacity and the influence of Mademoiselle dArmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon Debrayan expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that Eugnie detested Debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom Diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	69.85511016845703
Unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and Madame Danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of Eugnie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	104.70650482177734
She ran therefore to Debray who after having like the rest of Paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for threefourths of that city known as the capital of the world	233.45384216308594
At the precise time when Madame Danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to Debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home Debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions	113.48458862304688
Debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of Eugnie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a restingplace in his heart	65.01411437988281
Tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning	226.8017120361328
Meanwhile Madame Danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of Debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman	60.954193115234375
At twenty minutes to twelve Madame Danglars tired of waiting returned home	457.3309020996094
Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock	93.49447631835938
The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugnie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of Eugnie	181.00125122070312
She was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof	35.22359848022461
She listened at Eugnies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place	57.83506774902344
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep	26.692581176757812
She called the maid and questioned her	25.97823715209961
Mademoiselle Eugnie said the maid retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle dArmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer	96.45931243896484
Since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room Madame Danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events	46.676483154296875
In proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	24.050861358642578
And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercds who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son	40.05793380737305
Eugnie she said to herself is lost and so are we	64.4918441772461
The affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound	1.05207359790802
How fortunate that Eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble	63.772804260253906
And her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious Providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	91.63294219970703
And then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on Cavalcanti	146.8572540283203
This Andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	91.7237777709961
How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation Debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays herDebray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he	74.75528717041016
The baroness then thought of M	55.79837417602539
de Villefort	159.02687072753906
It was M	32.17048263549805
de Villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers	117.8036880493164
But no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their soninlaw	92.92720794677734
And since Villefort the friend of Danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of Andreas intrigues	154.17691040039062
Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	36.16352844238281
But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow	128.48500061035156
She would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	45.82415008544922
de Villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow Andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court	327.66827392578125
And after this reasoning she slept easily	146.16001892089844
At nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the Rue de Provence called a cab and drove to M	45.093013763427734
de Villeforts house	1.1323102712631226
For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague	292.1772155761719
Some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minutes air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice Will there be another funeral today at the procureurs house	53.89754104614258
Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell	51.68568420410156
Three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	84.7851333618164
He saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed	97.654541015625
Do you intend opening the door said the baroness	514.0139770507812
First madame who are you	372.1974792480469
Who am I You know me well enough	129.01461791992188
We no longer know anyone madame	99.86819458007812
You must be mad my friend said the baroness	79.69183349609375
Where do you come from	34.890167236328125
Oh this is too much	78.47705841064453
Madame these are my orders excuse me	37.60151672363281
Your name	82.36039733886719
The baroness Danglars you have seen me twenty times	75.60377502441406
Possibly madame	73.69741821289062
And now what do you want	57.64580154418945
Oh how extraordinary I shall complain to M	219.71665954589844
de Villefort of the impertinence of his servants	65.99981689453125
Madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from M	88.33541870117188
dAvrigny or without speaking to the procureur	91.90898132324219
Well I have business with the procureur	35.93465042114258
Is it pressing business	143.5652618408203
You can imagine so since I have not even brought my carriage out yet	72.30665588378906
But enough of thishere is my card take it to your master	30.524677276611328
Madame will await my return	53.52304458618164
Yes go	14.530982971191406
The concierge closed the door leaving Madame Danglars in the street	187.7357635498047
She had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut	150.90789794921875
Without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	51.45512390136719
The valet de chambre appeared on the doorsteps	62.25669479370117
You will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and M	62.90945053100586
de Villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise	36.208499908447266
In the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions	80.88780212402344
The baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates study	95.62076568603516
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	458.1524963378906
But Villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	256.6284484863281
Forgive my servants he said for a terror I can not blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious	51.438934326171875
Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far	44.86491394042969
You too then are unhappy she said	65.98770141601562
Yes madame replied the magistrate	86.23483276367188
Then you pity me	283.16314697265625
Sincerely madame	517.7737426757812
And you understand what brings me here	210.96237182617188
You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened	32.722740173339844
Yes sira fearful misfortune	134.05294799804688
You mean a mischance	145.95924377441406
A mischance repeated the baroness	25.180824279785156
Alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable	199.661376953125
And do you suppose this will be forgotten	22.826759338378906
Everything will be forgotten madame said Villefort	143.15353393554688
Your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter	58.66059875488281
Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	79.9655990600586
Am I come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	52.93318176269531
You know that you are madame said Villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	90.84642791748047
And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	227.64974975585938
Well then be more affectionate my dear Villefort said the baroness	52.06026077270508
Speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that I ought to be gay	123.8928451538086
Villefort bowed	10.15470027923584
When I hear misfortunes named madame he said I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then I can not help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind	144.84042358398438
That is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable	89.9251937866211
But this annoys you let us change the subject	355.3999328613281
You were saying madame	96.67154693603516
I came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor	252.5733184814453
Impostor repeated Villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others	22.57220458984375
Impostor indeedM	83.17343139648438
Andrea Cavalcanti or rather M	58.363319396972656
Benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin	92.91143798828125
Sir I do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	133.17581176757812
Come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go	221.9313507080078
You are too late madame the orders are issued	33.64203643798828
Well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him	78.37944793701172
I hope so	62.735374450683594
If they should arrest him I know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison	62.52012634277344
The procureur shook his head	33.51728820800781
